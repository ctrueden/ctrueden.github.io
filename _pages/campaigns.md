I play tabletop role-playing games. My main interest lies in d20, but I have also played BESM, Burning Wheel, Changeling, Deadlands, Dread, Exalted, In Nomine, Mechanical Dream, Paranoia, Tales from the Floating Vagabond, and probably others.

Here are some specific campaigns in which I've been involved:

* [Eidolons](/eidolons) - A D&D campaign I ran jointly with my friend Jon. We used [Pathfinder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game) with modifications. It ran from July 2009 until August 2010.
* [Deus Ultionis](/deus) - The sequel to Pax Artificium, set in the year 2299, using the [d20 Future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Future) expansion to the [d20 Modern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) rules, along with a healthy dose of [Dragonstar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonstar). It ran from September 2005 through June 2006.
* [Pax Artificium](/legacy/pax) - A [d20 Modern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) campaign I ran from June 2003 through August 2004, set in 2033-2034. The site catalogs tons of information about past sessions, as well as important characters.
* [KihrSutoTahn](/kihrsutotahn) - A homebrew campaign run by Joey Schneeberger.
