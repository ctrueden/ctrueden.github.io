A strange black bow relieved from a half-fiend hobgoblin found near the ((Monastary of the Yellow Rose)).  It appears to be made of some strange bone or horn and, if detected, it detects as evil.

Function: +1 Bloodseeking, Flaming, Mighty(+3) Composite Longbow.

In addition, when an arrow is notched on the string and pulled back, the wielder can utter the command word &quot;Sing for me&quot; in the Abyssal Language in a soft, coaxing manner, a move equivalent action.  When the arrow is released at a target, it whistles through the air, releasing a horrifying high-pitched wail that disturbs its intended victim.  The target of the arrow must succeed at a Will save (DC 15) or be shaken for 1 round.  The effect can be used any number of times per day, but each time an arrow is notched, the command word must be uttered again to receive the desired effect.
