Army represents the strength of the armed forces in a given area.

1 unit of Army represents the equivalent of the military strength of an army company.  
A company is traditionally comprised of 200 soldiers, or four platoons of 50 soldiers each.  Five companies together form a battalion; five battalions, or 5000 soldiers, form a regiment. 

However, at times a single unit of Army may actually be made up of a smaller number of people, particularly if they are of a higher level.  No unit of army will ever represent a smaller group than a platoon.
