Up untill a month and a half ago, Arorhon's life was simple, in as much as the life of the crown prince could be.  The constant lecturing on edicate, the history lessons, and the presentations to forign dignitaries were nice at first, but soon became common place. Routine.  Even his loving widowed mother was only able to give him so much of her time, as even being the figurehead of a nation takes alot out of one's schedual.

Which left only his training and his religious studies to provide him with some kind of satisfaction.  The ruler of a nation too should be expected to be strong, pious, and above all, wise.  For his age he managed surprisingly well in all three, and if it were not for his fate as Impiltur's next monarch being already sealed, he would have made a fine questing paladin.  To the mild dismay of his mother and the council, the prince did not find his religious inspirations coming from the god Illimater, but in Tyr.  For him the concept of self sacrifice was a means to the greater ends, the bringing of Justice and not the ends in of themselves.  

The reality of his fate in politics finaly came to a head when he was sent to go meet Princess Sarah Dragonsbane, his betrothed of 12 years, and present himself to King Gareth.  The Ball held in his honor was quiet, the good will of the occasion stifled by the news, or lack thereof, of the activities to the north.  The meeting with Sarah was awkward at first, neither he nor the future queen knowing what should be said, but the end results were hopeful as they began to warm to each other.  Regretably however he found himself seeing Princess Sarah as being the little sister he never had, and not his future wife and consort, but he consoled himself with the fact that she is still young and as far as arrainged marrages go, the first meeting was at least promising.  

The presentation to King Gareth was an entirely different matter, as immediately Arorhon recognized in the ruler every aspect he could ever asspire to be, and the king spied in the young prince great potential to be both a strong and wise ruler, providing of course, that he continues seriously his studies.  He charged Arorhon with a simple task.  He was to take his personal guard and patrol The Damaran countryside, so he may learn the ways of his future people.  

Just as things were looking up for Prince Arorhon, the news of his mother's death finaly caught up with him.  Minutes later he then learned that he had..perplexingly enough.. assumed control of the country as the legal successor, blamed Damara for the death of his mother, and to top things off, disbanded the ruling council of Imiltur.  This simply would not do.  But, of course, what could be done?  To return home without support, as the illusion of him already being home seemed total, would be suicide.  Since kingdoms need kings and not corpses, another path would need to be used.  King Gareth could provide him with this much needed support, but with the army of undead now pooring down from the north it seemed that he had much larger problems to concern himself over.  

So the prince did the only thing that he could, given the circumstances, and covered his heraldry, returned to the capital city and assisted as best he could in it's defense.  Regretably having only been taught the lessons of war and never experienced them personally, he, and his personal guards, were of paltry assistance at best.  In the end, all of his efforts resulted in him having a good view of King Gareth's final moments on Faerun, and with Gareth's spectacular departure left the Prince's best chance of vindication and a swift resolution to this most destressing delema.

Now the prince finds himself a soldier in the tattered remains of an army who'se country may soon be at war with his own.  But he manages even still to remain optomistic.  Afterall, it can't get much worse, can it?

Note about Appearance: The knowledge of the prince's Half celestial nature has been a closely guarded secret since birth, largely due to help give him an edge in surviving assassination attempts, which were all too common during his family's history (FR: Champions of Valor).  He manages to maintain a more human appearance through the help of a ring of Alter Self, which he can't control at this time.  As long as the ring is on him, he maintains the standard appearance.  Should the ring get removed, then the wings come out and the colors in parenthesis are used.
