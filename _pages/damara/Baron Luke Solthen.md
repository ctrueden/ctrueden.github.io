Luke's background is a mystery before he came to Damara.  In Damara, however, he was fairly well known for his weapon skill as he showed off his years of experience.  He was granted a Barony for his help in fighting the many evils that dwelt the land at the age of 25.  In order to secure his land, he checked out some of the caves in his domain.  More than a few led to the underdark, and he decided to explore these, to have an idea of the surrounding communities.  He found the Elan (who would become the people of ((Freedoms Tear|Freedom's Tear)) upon their return) after a couple of years exploring the underdark, and lead them back to the surface.  Most of the (significant) wealth he had developed during his years of adventuring went towards the construction of ((Freedoms Tear|Freedom's Tear)).

About 10 years after the emergence of the Elan from the underdark, the Elan offered Luke the chance to transform.  They informed him of the side effects (not the least of which was the loss of most of his skill and ability).  As Damara had become relatively stable, he believed he would be able to get his skill back before he would be needed, and he considered the benefits to far outweigh the penalties.  He agreed.  The ritual was performed, and he was remade as an Elan, with only rudimentary knowledge of the style he had fought so hard to master.  He was still confident he would be able to relearn it (he could still remember doing it, he just couldn't rememebr HOW) at a leisurely pace, now that he had a very long lifespan to train.tIn fact, he showed much more power than most newly transformed Elan, and was eager to test his new limits, though he knew he'd first have to return to his former level of skill.

Less than a month after his transformation, the Vaasan invasion began.

Luke finds the use of enchantments to be absolutely repulsive, thus his role in aiding the Elan.  Taking away one's own identity is the worst crime someone could commit.  He also dislikes necromancers, as the manipulation of life and death is not something people should be dealing with.  He uses an exotic combat style he claims to have developed on his own, though whether or not this is true is unknown.  He considers ranged combat to be for the weak or cowardly.  He may occasionally throw a weapon or sling a spell (especially at an aforementioned ranged combatant), but he holds no faith in bows, with their physical and emotional distance.  Combat should be personal.

He is the Baron of the land in the northern Galena mountains, which contains the town of ((Freedoms Tear|Freedom's Tear)).  He and ((Gil)) work together to better their country and barony.  He follows Ilmater, such that his suffering may prevent the suffering of others. 

As one of the few Elan made after their migration to the surface, he looks almost exactly human.  At 6'0&quot;, he's tall, with a strong build and brown hair and green eyes.  His sharp mind contrasts sharply with his rough personality, and he looks constantly for ways to test himself.  His actual age is 37, though he looks a bit younger, as the transformation made him relatively younger.

Very recently, he was looking through some of the things he hadn't managed to sell off.  The sorts of things powerful wizards collect.  He was fiddling with one such item: an odd, nondescript stone, wondering what the hell it was or where he had picked it up.  A quick light spell didn't help nearly as much as he had hoped, and as he rolled in around in his hand, It smeared of on his skin.  It then rolled around his hand, coating it, and then proceeded to merge with his hand, and the covering spread throughout his body.

&quot;I'm like my own apprentice, touching things I shouldn't and dealing with things I don't understand.&quot; He said later as he flipped through his tomes, struggling to uncover what that stone was, and what it did to him.

It took a few weeks to sort through his ridiculously long notes about everything, but he did manage to find out where he had picked it up.  It was actually created by the same illithid colony he killed, as was effectively a way to fuse a creature with the essence of Earth.  Doing so would make them more resilient and powerful, presumably to allow them to mine better or fight better in Arenas.  

In addition, while browsing his notes he found some rituals that intrigued him.  They involved the existence of beings that didn't exist, and how their power was used.  In fact, Luke had himself done this many times before, and though the details eluded him, he managed to find out enough from his notes to bind what seemed to be his favorite one: A being called Paimon.
