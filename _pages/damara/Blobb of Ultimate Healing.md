This is a semi translucent blob with a glowing center. It is the tiny remains of a living heal spell that was recovered from a family crypt inside Trails End.  It will provide one Heal at caster level 12 per day to the first thing it touches, however further attempts to pester it will result in it slapping the character on the hand with a psudeopod for 1 lethal bashing.  

It will be kept in the hospital within the capital city for both research and use.
