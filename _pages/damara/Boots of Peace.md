The boots of peace grants the wearer an effect similar to ''Sanctuary''.  Making an attack against the wearer requires a successful will save DC 16.  If the attacker fails the save he may not attack the wearer for 1d4 rounds, after which he is no longer required a save to attack for the rest of the mission.  Like sanctuary this applies only to ranged, targeted, and melee effects not area.
