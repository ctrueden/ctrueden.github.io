-=Damaran Chronicles - Campaign Overview=-

!!!The Story of ((Damara))
This campaign is focused more on ((Damara)) than on any specific characters.  Hence, players will have  the opportunity to play many different PCs over the course of the campaign.  In addition, the campaign in structured in such a way as to not require any specific player for any specific session, hopefully easing logistical issues.

!!!Cooperative Story Telling
Though I intend to retain some minimal control over developments in the campaign (the main story specifically), I really don't have the attention span to manage a project like the one I'm proposing on my own.  Therefore, DM duties can be shared by all players (because I would also like to be a player), and I encourage every player to develop missions and any other content they see fit.  I will initially keep some oversight of missions, so that the rewards are at least somewhat consistent.

!!!Setting
The setting of this campaign is fairly standard forgotten realms.  The game is set in the kingdom of ((Damara)), under the rule of ((King Gareth Dragonsbane)), in midsummer of the year 1372.  Before designing characters players are encourage to read about ((Damara|Damaran History)).

Players are encouraged to complete their initial character concepts before reading the ((Prologue)).

!!!((Primary)) and ((Secondary)) PCs
Each player will build a ((Primary)) level 1 PC, using the gestalt rules presented in Unearthed Arcana.  The ((Primary)) must be a character from the nobility (possibly from the Dragonsbane bloodline).  Each player will also build a ((Secondary)) level 6 PC, who will be constructed normally.  The ((Secondary)) must be someone with an important position in ((Damara)) (military commander, court wizard, prominent merchant, etc.).  The ((Secondary)) automatically gains Leadership as a bonus feat, as will the ((Primary)) upon reaching level 6.

!!!((Pool)) PCs
In addition to their ((Primary)) and ((Secondary)) characters, players will be encouraged to create additional PCs who are followers of a ((Primary)) or ((Secondary)) PC.  These characters are referred to as ((Pool)) characters, and will be available for any player to use for most ((Missions)), excluding specific ((Story Missions)).

!!!No Secrets Amongst Players
In keeping with the goal of cooperative story telling, there are to be no secrets about PCs that are kept from any of the players.  Keeping secrets __in game__ is of course encouraged.

!!!Available Character Options for ((Pool)) PCs
Initially the choice of base classes and prestige classes will be limited.  Feats and spells will be similarly limited.  These options will be expanded as time goes on, partially based on what missions the players undertake.  Basically, classes, spells, feats, and other character options that are exclusive to specific organizations or areas of the world cannot be taken until connections are established between them and Damara.

!!!Character Advancement
Initially each story character gains one level each chapter.  They may then retool their equipment to the standard GP for a character of their level.  Pool PCs may essentially be leveled arbitrarily, keeping in mind the limits on participation in missions.

!!!Money &amp; Wealth
Each PC has access to a certain amount of money, as normally collected via adventures, professions, and whatever else.  In addition, the primary PCs have control over the Wealth of Damara, and may allocate it to projects as they see fit.  Wealth doesn't represent a specific amount of money per se, but will have similar uses, albeit on a larger scale.

!!!Country Stats
Since the story is mostly about ((Damara)), the country also has a ((Statistics of Damara|character sheet)).  The statistics on this page represent how the country as a whole is doing, and include things like ((Reputation)) with neighboring countries and the general situation inside ((Damara)) (e.g.: ((Bandit Activity)).

!!!Chapters
The campaign is divided into chapters.  The players will be able to choose a certain number of missions to attempt in each chapter (they must attempt all story missions in each chapter).  Except for story missions, players can use any character from the pool in any mission.  The characters used on a mission are unavailable for any other missions in that chapter, but will become available for new missions at the beginning of the next chapter.

!!!((Missions))
A central theme of this campaign is the availability of missions.  Every session the players will choose a mission to play, or continue, from the available missions.  For most of these missions the players will be allowed to play any PC from the pool.  Each mission will have keywords at the beginning which describe what sort of challenges the players will face, aiding in appropriate PC selection.  A challenge rating is also provided so PCs of about the right level are used.  Each mission will also have details on the large-scale effect of the mission, which is separate from any items or bonuses obtained in the mission.  

!!!Mission Results
The results are split into three categories: Good (or complete success), Fair (or partial success), and Poor (failure).  Results that affect Country Stats are applied immediately, items of power (artifacts, etc.) are revealed, wealth is distributed/used, and any events are initiated.

*((Items of Power)) (IoP) - These represent artifacts, secret spells, powerful allies, and other things that cannot normally be acquired.  Many missions will provide IoPs, but the exact nature of the IoP in question is not revealed until the mission is complete.  Some IoPs can also be purchased with Wealth.

*((Events)) - Events are special missions results that can have a wide range of effects, from unlocking new classes, to initiating extra story missions (which then must be selected in the next chapter).  The players will know what missions cause events, as well as a name of the event, but will not know the specifics of that event until it begins.
