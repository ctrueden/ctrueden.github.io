Carlyndi is a halfling woman whose family was one of many being coerced into paying &quot;protection fees&quot; to some corrupt officers. Her family had little choice but to give into the demands for a number of months, to prevent their shop from suffering an unfortunate &quot;accident,&quot; until another officer, ((High Executioner Eberhard Jarls|Eberhard Jarls)), spoke out against the corruption. Tragically, though Eberhard saved Carlyndi's family, he lost his own, and nearly his life.

Carlyndi, feeling tremendously indebted to Eberhard, as well as terribly guilty for what happened, vowed to repay him somehow. Through hard work and natural aptitude, she caught ((Baron Donlevy the Young|Baron Donlevy))'s eye (having heard about his unusual and effective &quot;agile&quot; fighting style) and managed to earn a position in his service. After learning the swashbuckler art from him, she departed to pledge her service to Jarls.
