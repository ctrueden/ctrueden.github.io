Chapter Actions represent the amount of time and manpower available in the chapter (i.e. how many ((Missions)) the players go on before the chapter ends).

*This statistic is reduced by 1 at the start of each ((Missions|Mission)).
*It is possible for ((Missions)) or ((Events)) to restore points to this statistic.

Note that we are no longer using Chapter Actions for the campaign; instead, a chapter ends when all its story missions have been played.
