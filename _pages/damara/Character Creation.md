To give players the maximum autonomy in character creation, optional rules have been implemented to eliminate randomness during creation.

''note:'' To allow flexibility without breaking the system this campaign will use fractional values for alot of things.  In all cases these fractions are to be rounded down when used in game.  Check the ((System Rulings)) for more info.

-=Ability Scores=-

All characters will use a modified version of the point buy system presented in the DMG.  The point cost of ability scores remain the same, however the initial point pool for each character is as follows:

||Primary Characters|48 Ability Points
Secondary Characters|36 Ability Points
Pool Characters|28 Ability Points||
For those of you without a DMG, the point cost is as follows: 
8(0) 9(1) 10(2) 11(3) 12(4) 13(5) 14(6) 15(8) 16(10) 17(13) 18(16)

All racial and age modifiers come after point buy.  And no, you can't go below 8 during point buy.

-=Hit Points=-

Characters recieve full hit points for first level, as normal.  Beyond first level characters recieve a set amount of hit points per HD instead of rolling.  Any other hp modifiers (high CON, feats, etc.) are then added to the total as normal.

In general, Primary Characters recieve 3/4 of maximum hp, Secondary Characters recieve 2/3, and pool characters recieve 1/2.  The following table summarizes the hp recieved per level by HD.

|| |d4|d6|d8|d10|d12
Primary Characters|3.25|4.75|6.25|7.75|9.25
Secondary Characters|3|4.33|5.67|7|8.33
Pool Characters|2.5|3.5|4.5|5.5|6.5||

-=Race &amp; Class=-

For Primaries and Secondaries all races and classes are available, however since part of the fun of this game is supposed to be unlocking new races and classes I ask that people try to avoid exotic things starting off.

For Pool Chracters only those races and classes that have been unlocked during the campaign are available.

-=Templates, Bloodlines, Feats, Etc.=-

Again, Primaries and Secondaries can use any of these optional rules, but I encourage players to limit thier choices to those normally found within Damara.

Pool Characters are limited to whatever options have been unlocked.

-=Starting Gold=-

First-level characters receive the maximum starting gold of their (most favorable) class.  
All higher-level characters start with normal gold for characters of their level (DMG page 135).  
The extra equipment listed in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting is not being used. 

-=Pool Characters and Leadership=-

Story (primary and secondary) characters all receive Leadership and Great Renown as bonus feats at 6th level. Pool characters may be created at any starting level, but must be a follower of a story character, who is that pool character's &quot;Liege.&quot;

Each story character may have one cohort according to the normal [http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#leadership|Leadership rules] (typically, the cohort is two levels lower than the liege character, depending on the liege's Charisma score). However, instead of the number of followers listed in the table, the following system will be used:

The sum of the levels of the pool characters (followers) for a particular liege may not exceed the leadership score of that liege. The maximum level for a given pool character is the liege's level minus 3.

When designing a pool character, it may be assigned to any liege, assuming there are enough &quot;leadership points&quot; available for that liege. However, the liege's player reserves the right to veto pool characters deemed inappropriate.

Thus, available non-story missions will have a maximum CR of (chapter + 2) for pool character followers, or (chapter + 3) for pool character cohorts.

-=Leveling -- Gold, XP and Equipment=-

Story characters automatically level between chapters, at a rate decided during each ((Wrap-Up)) session. Pool characters never level unless someone wants them to do so.

When characters level up, they receive an amount of gold matching the difference in level as given in the DMG (page 135) for &quot;starting gold for characters above first level&quot;. 

Some game mechanics require the payment of XP to do certain things. This XP can be &quot;purchased&quot; at an exchange rate of 1 XP for 5 gold. XP purchased in this manner cannot be used to gain levels.

This XP exchange rule should be used when casting spells with an XP component, or when buying off ((Level Adjustments)) (though the table linked lists prices in gold, not XP). One exception is the item creation feats -- see below. 

The optional craft point system from Unearthed Arcana is being used.  Creating magic items will be possible for all characters using the requisite gold (50% of market value) and craft points (14%, equal to the 10% craft points and the 4% XP cost).  The item creation feats add the number of craft points listed in UA to a character's total.  Characters can also purchase magic items at normal market value.  Characters must therefore record the number of craft points used as well as GP spent. 

One other note about equipment: all limited use items (potions, scrolls, wands, etc.) refresh at the beginning of each mission. For example, if you use a scroll on a mission, you'll have it again for the next mission. This rule is to cut down on the bookkeeping necessary per character.

To adjust for this, the following variations are in effect:
*Wands are unlimited use, 3 times per day, and cost the same as usual. Or you can purchase wands of 50 charges per mission at double the usual cost.
*Staves have 10 charges per mission.
*All single use items (scrolls, potions, rod of negation, certain wondrous) cost four times normal.
*Psionic items function as their magical correllaries.
*Charged rods, in particular Rod of Absorption, are undecided and need to be discussed later.
