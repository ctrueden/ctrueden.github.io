This page chronicles the history of civic actions taken by characters and the Damaran nation as a whole.

A character can engage in whatever kind of civic actions he likes, with a wide range of consequences as determined during each ((Wrap-Up)), but his actions only limitedly affect the ((Statistics of Damara)).
Primary characters receive two civic actions per chapter, and Secondary characters receive one.  Pool characters are not able to perform civic actions. 
In game terms, a civic action may change one statistic in one region by three points.  Alternatively, a civic action may be used to work on building a particular structure with specific consequences for individual characters or the greater group of pool PCs.  It may also be used to gain the benefits of one of the individually beneficial structures.
