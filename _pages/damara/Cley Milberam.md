Cley is a sorcerer who was working as one of ((Oreth Sondorin))'s assistants during the time that Oreth was performing secret research. Along with ((Teeple)), Cley has tried to convince people that Oreth is not craven, but was rather afflicted with a magical malady, but rumors of Oreth's cowardice nevertheless persist.

Cley has a natural talent for magic but was not a particularly good researcher. As such, Oreth has asked him to travel the kingdom to help rebuild the nation. Cley suspects that Oreth was merely trying to be rid of him, but complied anyway, since he enjoys traveling.
