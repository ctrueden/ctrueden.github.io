Danrelle Ranalt, daughter of ((Shamir Ranalt|Shamir)), is an impetuous and headstrong 16-year-old.  Though her father hopes that one day she will take over his trading empire, Danrelle's interests truly lie in much more physical pursuits.  She is reasonably competent at most of the skills her father has tried to teach her, but when it comes to stealth, infiltration, and assassination, Danrelle truly shines.  She has been practicing hard, and her vision for her future is much more likely to include a Thieves' Guild than a Merchant's Guild.
