Edlin Dragonsbane, ''suo jure'' Duchess of Erat, Countess of Selkirk, is the niece of ((King Gareth Dragonsbane)) and the twin sister of ((Ewan Dragonsbane)), Duke of Emsat, Earl of Lanark.  She is both a bard and a cleric of Mystra, deity of magic and the Weave. Edlin is kind and gentle, willing to help wherever she is needed, and a devoted follower of her deity.  She grew up in a cloister in a secluded area of Damara, so while she is trained in diplomacy and statecraft, magic and weaponry, she is not always terribly worldly.  She also knows an amazing amount about many obscure and varied subjects.
