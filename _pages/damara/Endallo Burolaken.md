Endallo is a young half-orc white dragon shaman from the barbarian lands. He heard about ((Spirit Talker Azar))'s unusual powers, and left his homeland to see what he could learn from her, to further his own development. Endallo is distant and aloof, and does not make friends easily, but he is a fierce and steadfast ally during times of trouble.

While traveling on a mission with ((Talos)) to discover the cause of the recent attacks on the ((Order of the Yellow Rose)), Endallo found he shared Talos's distain for civilized life, as well as his desire to pound things with sticks. When Endallo's forehead was marked by a demon, in a manner similar to Talos's brand of the Witch-King, he took it for a sign that he should follow Talos instead.
