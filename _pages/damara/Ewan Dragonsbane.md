-=Trump=-

A tall, dark haired man stands in the midst of a masquerade ball.  He wears a crimson costume embroidered with flames.  His steel-gauntled left hand rests on the pommel of the blade at his side and his right hand hold up a glass of wine as if toasting the viewer.  A red-haired woman in an ivory mask stands at his side.  Behind them is a fountain filled with blood-red wine.  The dark, indistinct figure of another woman leans over the side of the fountain.  A trick of perspective makes it look as though she is whispering into the man's ear.

-=Beliefs and Goals=-

*The throne will be mine, but it's not yet time to make a move.  I need to build my power base first.
*The undead are an abomination, but also a useful tool.  I will use them to end this war as quickly as possible and then rid Damara of them.
*Art is sacred; see if I can't get some more for my estate.
