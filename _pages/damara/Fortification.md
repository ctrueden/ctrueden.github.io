Fortification represents the area's innate ability to be defended, either through natural geographic qualities such as from a mountain pass, or due to man-made improvements such as stone walls and castles.

Fortification augments Army for the purposes of defending the region from invaders.

The effectiveness of the regions defenses is determined through two numbers. The first number is the natural defenses inherent in the area, and will range between 50 and 250. 50 would be similar to being in flatlands surrounded by hills with dried river beds everywhere, whereas 250 would be mountain terrain with plenty of accessible areas to build on, rivers, and weather that is both harsh and sadistic.

The second stat is the level at which the local population has prepared the area for defense, making best use of the available terrain and materials etc. This number ranges between 1 (A shed, maybe made of straw) to 1000 (walled citadels, underground access tunnels, artillery emplacements and.....)

To determine the defensive capabilities of the region, take the first number as a percentage and apply it to the second. This will get you a number between .5 (wow you're in trouble) and 2500 (your enemy either best know what it's doing, or move on).

Players can modify the second number reasonably easily. The first would require you getting extremely creative and is subject to group DM approval.
