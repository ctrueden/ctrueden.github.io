Gareth Tremier (born Soren Tremier) is the son of two of the ((Zhengyi the Witch-King|Witch-King's)) more powerful servants: ((Ramses Tremier|Ramses)), a warlock, and ((Dahlia Tremier|Dahlia)), a sorceress. When Soren was a small child, his father was killed during the epic battle between Zhengyi and ((King Gareth Dragonsbane|Dragonsbane)), and upon the Witch-King's defeat, Soren and his mother were taken prisoner.

Dragonsbane offered the Witch-King's servants two options: either swear a vow of allegiance to him and to the kingdom of Damara, or accept a merciful death. Dahlia chose the former, and became a Damaran court sorceress, applying her skills in service to the king. In a (transparently specious) show of loyalty, Dahlia renamed her son &quot;Gareth&quot; after the king. Gareth grew up in the royal court at ((Heliogabalus)).

Dahlia was known to be a former servant of the Witch-King, and to possess powerful magic, so few if any dared speak badly of her or her son openly. But many whispered behind closed doors about Gareth's dark heritage, and he was never fully accepted by his peers. However, the king himself showed a personal interest in his namesake, and took time out to instruct the child in Ilmater's ideals -- and though Gareth's upbringing was also influenced by his mother, and by his tainted bloodline, he had a good heart and had a generally happy childhood.

Shortly before the Witch-King's return to power, Dahlia mysteriously disappeared from court. Though many did not realize it at the time, she had left to rejoin Zhengyi's cause. She was slain during the second epic confrontation between Dragonsbane and Zhengyi, leaving Gareth an orphan.

Around that same time, just prior to the Witch-King's reawakening, Gareth began to feel evil power welling up within himself, and with it, dark impulses that became harder and harder to control. Scared, Gareth confided in King Dragonsbane, who suggested he pray for guidance. Gareth visited a temple of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sune|Sune], goddess of love and beauty, hoping to receive strength against the ugliness and hate intensifying within him. No one can truly know the heart of the gods, but apparently Sune was intrigued by Gareth's situation, and took it as a challenge to redirect the boy's evil heritage into a force for good. With his newfound divine power as one of Sune's chosen, Gareth's soul was fortified against his warlock heritage. Recently, Gareth has also begun to discover that he inherited his mother's talent for sorcery.

Now that his mentor, King Dragonsbane, is gone forever, and Damara is on the brink of collapse, Gareth is anxious to volunteer himself to save the kingdom and prove to his peers that he is different from his parents. He is training hard to unify three powers within himself: the warlock's dark power (evil), Sune's divine blessings (good), and his magical talent for sorcery (neutral).
