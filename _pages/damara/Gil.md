tGil, along with other Elan, believe that control over one's own mind is something of paramount importance.  In addition, many of them become telepaths (Gil being no exception), to redeem the discipline from the abuse the Illithids used it for.  He is an emissary to the baron of some land in the Galena mountains( ((Baron Luke Solthen)) ).  Thankful to Luke for giving his community (the people of ((Freedoms Tear)) a place to dwell, he does whatever he can to help Damara.  He worships Ilmater, as his people have persevered through their suffering, and so gained strength and purpose.  He was doing so well as a diplomat that Gareth expanded his duties and started sending him as an emissary to foreign nations.  This frustrated Luke a bit, but Gil saw it as the opportunity it was.  He has been training for some time, getting ready for further attacks by Illithids.

tHe is around 130 years old, and has been an elan since the age of 26 (which is his apparent age to those who don't know him well).  Since his freedom from the Illithids, he has been instrumental in organizing and inspiring his fellow Elan.  He has with a typical Elan appearance (red hair, Blue eyes, around 5'7&quot;, and of a light build).  Centuries of inbreeding have not spawned much diversity.
