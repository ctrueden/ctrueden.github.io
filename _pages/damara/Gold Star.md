A Gold Star is a special reward for contributing to the campaign, above and beyond acting as a player. Each Gold Star you earn reduces your effective level by one for the purposes of computing the ((Item of Legacy)) penalty for your primary character. You earn a Gold Star by facilitating the campaign in some way -- designing a mission, running a mission, or putting forth some other meritorious effort, as judged by at least three other players.

Note that we have discontinued the Gold Star system. Instead, no character suffers any item of legacy penalties whatsoever.
