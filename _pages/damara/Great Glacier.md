The Great Glacier is a glacier north of ((Vaasa)), shrouded in mystery. Many believe it to be an evil place, an expression of nature's darker side.  Legends say that the Great Glacier once covered all the land of Damara, and that remnants of its power still lurk in the lakes and grottoes of the land.

A ((Great Glacier Tradition|minority religion)) in Damara considers the Great Glacier a holy place and venerates these remnants of its power.
