Area around the citadel scoured of all life for a mile or so.  (spot 20) Not only all life, but all traces of life, no dead wood, etc.

Citadel itself nestled in a valley high in the mountains, a black jagged spike rising from the stone.  (know architecture 15) Citadel very very similar to the citadel of the witch king.  

Shifting illusion repeatedly conceals the citadel, the magic winks off, breaking into pieces that shift and fall apart repatedly.  (know arcana 30) The magic is of a power equaled only by the ancient mythals.

The gates of the citadel are open, and broken.  (spot 20) Only the stone remains, the metal hinges gone.

The citadel itself is empty, scoured of all life. (listen 25) Vauge echoes of a hollow keening ring throughout.  Nothing remains, no trace of any life on the lower levels.  (detect evil) The citadel burns with intense evil.

Most of the way up the pinacle of rock the players come accross a wooden door, sealed with powerful wards scralled in blood.  (know arcana 25)  The wards are designed to protect against undead, but are more powerful than any the players know of.  The wards do not hinder the players at all, and the door is unlocked and untrapped (unless there's a rogue in the party).  (listen 20) When the players open the door, a hollow keening (the same as before) cries out distantly, perhaps a mile away.

As the players search the library, the keening slowly grows closer.

Beyond the door is a library, perhaps.  Or a magical lab.  Or a mixture of the two.  Books line the walls, tables in the center contain many odd beakers and vials of strange liquid, mostly black (the liquid shows dim signs of magic, as if they were once powerfully magic but that power has faded).  A robed body lies in the center, clutching a black book bound in skin, with a quill coverd in dried blood (human skin, if the players have a way of finding out). (detect evil) the book itself is not evil, and infact resonates with faint positive energy.  The pages of the book are not magical, but the binding is.  (know arcana 20) desinged to prevent undead from opening it.  The book details many expiriments conducted to create more powerful forms of undead.  Many spells are detailed as well, designed to both bolster and control undead.  The spells themselves are too complicated to be readily understood, and the book speaks of 'using the power of several souls' to cast them.  

One passage details research conducted into skipping the normal regenerative process a lich goes through after destruction by raising it's spirit automatically and infusing it into a prepared clone.  

The last few pages are scralled in blood, similar to the wards on the door.  They vaguely describe that the process of raising the lich went horribly wrong.  They raised Zhengyi's spirit, or at least the shadow of his power.  But there was no mind behind the power, no soul.  The shadow was raised in the basement, in a specially prepared room.  Much of the CoA was there, at least those who didn't accompany Knellict in his bid to sieze power in Impilter (this is a fairly important plot point).  The shadow didn't possess the vessel prepared for him, a young body, who had been raised by the CoA and is referred to as Zhengyi's blood descendent.  Instead it began killing indiscriminately, the force radiating from it corroding everything but stone.  The book vageuly refers to great slashing claws and a piercing keening that stunned much of the assembled crowd, preventing them from fleeing.  Only two escaped, Zhengyi's blood heir, who was teleported away before the keening began, (know arcana 30) the keening as describes must cancel teleportation magic) and the writer of the book.  The writer of the book was heavily wounded, infected with a poison or something that repeatedly dealt negative energy damage.  He managed to ascend to his lab before passing away, raising wards to prevent the monster from following, but he could not find a way to save himself.  The book is penned as a warning to Knellict, should he return to determine what happened to the Citadel.

Somewhere in the passages of blood the writer describes absorbing the spirits of the fallen, to give him the strength to escape, and details the words used to activate the spell, which is an inherent property of the Citadel.  Should the players speak these words in the room, the one who spoke will absorb the spirit of the Necromancer. In fact, for the hell of it, if the choose not to speak it just thinking about the words activates the magic.  The spirit of the necromancer is drawn into the player who activates the magic.  It gives the player power, and a ghostly voice occasionally whispers to the player.  Also, the player gets a red chip, with some sort of note indicating whose soul it represents.

At this point the keening will have entered the tower.  (listen 20) it is clearly ascending the tower, heading straight for the players.

The players each begin taking negative damage every round when they reach the first floor.  1d10, and any negative energy protection spell is stripped away in a matter of rounds. Negative energy damage ramps up on higher floors (2d10 on second floor, 3d10 on third, 4d10 on fourth)

There are 3 stories remaining of the tower before the players reach the pinnacle.  The door on the other side of the library, which is locked (DC 20) and trapped, leads to stairs up.  The door at the top of the stairs is barred from this side.

The next floor is a full necromantic laboratory.  There are several remaining expiraments, bolstered by the shadow's approach.  On the other side of the lab is another door, with wards against undead, inscribed in the metal (as opposed to blood). (spot 20) the door they came through has similar wards.  (baddies below)  The door on the other side is barred. Behind the door is another staircase.  The door at the top is guilded with gold, and has elaborate etchings of skeletons operating complex machinery.

This story contains a long room, with guilded columns and rich crimson drapings alternating with tapestries depicting undead and necromancers (all intelligent undead), with doors leading off the main hall.  A door on the other side of the room is made out of flat black stone with no adornment.  The hall contains a wide variety of traps, based primarily on complex machinery (5 traps, 3 mechanical, 2 magical).  Once the players reach the other side and open the door (not locked or trapped) a great beam of negative energy blasts through the hall (reflex save).  The stairs on the other side of the door are made of bone.  As the players ascend the stairs, skeletal hands reach for them and attempt to hold them on the stairs (+15 attack, +15 grapple, DC 20 stength check to break free).  At the top of the stairs is a gate of bone, with a pitch black room beyond.

The pitch black room is paved with skulls, and great columns of gigantic bones reach up to the vaulted cieling.  Whispers echo through the chamber, and waves of black energy wash accross the room.  (spot 20, or 30 if the players don't have a light source) the waves break on the columns, and a small area behind them appears to be safe from the black energy.  The players must make the trek accross the room to the stairway on the opposite side.  The stairway is again made of bones, with the same arms attempting to restrain the players.  There is no door or gate at the top of the stairs.

The room at the pinnacle of the tower rises maybe 100' above the players.  A chill wind rises from behind, sucking into a tunnel at the opposite side.  Two undead guards of some form guard the entrance to the portal (find appropriate guards).

At the top of the tower a black tunnel leads into nothingness.  (know arcana 25) the tunnel leads to an extra dimensional space.  The tunnel is made out of souls.  A pitch black wall of negative energy, with ghostly faces screaming silently.  Will saves are required to continue walking through the tunnel.  At the end of the tunnel is an ornate black gate, which opens upon the approach of the players.  If the players are significantly ahead of the creature it catches up in the tunnel, gliding unhindered through the darkness.

The room at the end of the tunnel is a throne room, with a great throne of bone occupying a place on a dias in the center.  The entire room is draped with crimson cloth, which pulses eeirily.  The shadow fills the room, and the strongest remaining player has a choice to make.  The spirit of the necromancer is whispering words of power that will seal the room off from the material plane, trapping the shadow safely in the astral plane.  But the shadow whispers as well, offering power beyond the players wildest dreams, the player will become the reincarnation of the Witch-King's power.  A will save (DC 10) must be made to resist the offer and speak the words of sealing.  This will save is negatively modified by the number of red chips the player has accumulated.

Absorbing souls:  Absorbing a soul restores the player to full hitpoints (after any hit dice modifires).  The player can also hear whispers of each soul they have absorbed.  The players who have absorbed a soul know that the souls will slip away eventually.  The players get bonuse hit dice equal to 1/3 of the absorbed souls HD.  The player can use all of the absorbed souls skills, with ranks equal to 1/3 of the absorbed souls ranks.  The player recieves a bonus to all saves equal to 1/3 of the absorbed souls HD.  Ability checks are likewise improved.  The player recieves an attack bonuse equal to 1/2 the absorbed souls level.

The Shadow:  It is a creature composed of a flowing inky blackness, the only details that are apparent are glowing red eyes, and great bloodly claws of bone, reminiscent of scythe blades.  If the shadow catches up to a player it attacks as a nightwalker.
