Health represents how robust the region's people are. A low Health could indicate a famine or plague, or merely delicate people, whereas a high Health shows a tough, resilient populace with strong fertility and stamina.  

Health scores are always between 0 and 100.  0 represent the land filled with corpses (you naughty naughty rulers) and 100 being average expected life span at about 80 with no health problems or starvation in the area beyond..say.. the common cold and having the munchies.  

Expect your average medeval town to be about 70, whereas cities should be about 60.
