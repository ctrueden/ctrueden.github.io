Eberhard Jarls is the High Executioner of Damara.  When the law judges someone guilty of a crime punishable by death, it is Eb who removes their heads.

Eb is 28 years old, 6'1&quot; tall, 193'bs. and has short brown hair and brown eyes.  His skin is white and rough with dark hairs lining most of his body.  His physique is large though not overly frightening.  His judging gaze gives anybody with a fear of death the jibblies.  It is as if he is imagining various ways to kill you and finding enjoyment out of it (which he is).  He is not a very pleasant person to be around, though he can hold his own in a conversation and has been known to entertain the more macabre personalities with his beliefs about death.

Eberhard Jarls became an officer of the law at a young age.  He was strict, cruel, and unliked by almost everyone, but always followed the word of the law.  When Gareth Dragonsbane became king, he spent much time searching for people he could trust and put them in high positions.  It was around this time that Eb stumbled upon some of his fellow officers partaking in shady dealings.  Despite threats made against him and his family, Eb came out with the truth about the corruption of the other officers.  Shortly thereafter, Eb came home and found his family murdered.  Just then, the other officers arrived and arrested him.  Eb spent a long time in prison awaiting his trial and execution.  At the trial he was pronounced guilty of murdering his own family (punishable by death).  However, King Dragonsbane stepped forward with proof of Eb's innocence and of the corruption of the other officers.  Alhough Gareth knew Eb to be an evil man by nature, it was obvious to him that this was a man who would never betray his oath or his word.  He upheld the law even when everyone was against him and even when his own family was threatened.  The King thought up a position that would be perfect for a man like Eb.  He offered to make Eb the High Executioner of Damara.  Eb was shocked.  No one had ever stood up for him before.  He thought about it for a bit and realized that he would really enjoy such a high-ranking position.  Not to mention that he could legally serve his own newfound desire to kill.  Right then and there Eb swore an oath to serve the King Dragonsbane until the end of his days.

Death's Hand:  A place for the wicked.

`It is a harsh lesson, but a necessary one', Eb thought.  `The Princess will come to understand the necessity of death in civilization as time passes.  How do you really explain to a child that sometimes people go somewhere and never return?  How also do you explain that it is not a bad thing?'

Eb escorts the bound mugger to what he likes to think of as "The Apparatus".  This is where he executes the guilty, the ones too weak to control their urges and decide to make life worse for everyone else by doing something against the law.  These outlaws have no place in the world as far as Eb is concerned.  He feels no guilt over his job, in fact he enjoys removing the bad elements in life.  It gives him a sense of righteous satisfaction.  He feels apart of the ever-working machine of life.  It is right to execute these murderers, these traitors and oath breakers.  Eb loves his job.

The king had brought his daughter to witness the execution of the mugger.  She would inherit the throne someday, so he felt it was best to teach her the hard truth sooner rather than later.  The Princess cried saying that people shouldn't ever "go away", that they should just stay around and be happy forever.  To which The King explained that the gods put a limit on the time people have in the world for a reason.  If people break that limit, it causes dark things to happen.  He told young Sarah again of her mother's death by the hand of The Witch King.  The Witch King decided that he wanted to remain in the world.  He did terrible things, killing hundreds of thousands of people.  The Witch King's actions caused immeasurable amounts of suffering.

"You are so very much like your mother, Sarah, compassionate and merciful.  You ask that this man live, but you must come to realize that some people, the criminals, the ones that would destroy the order of the realm must pay for their crimes.  Justice demands this man's death.  What if we allowed him to live?  What if we allowed every criminal to live?  We would have nowhere to put them and we would have to let them back out on the street where they would continue causing everyone more suffering.  Someday, you will become the ruler of Damara and you must be strong for the sake of the people."

"Father, I don't understand."  "I know Dearest, and I love you so much for it, but I must try to explain it to you nevertheless, and I hope someday you will understand."

"Judge you may proceed."

The judge pronounced the guilt of the mugger for the deaths of three citizens of Damara and that these crimes were punishable by execution.  "High Executioner, you may proceed."

High Executioner Eberhard Jarls placed the mugger on The Apparatus.  "Do you have any final words?"  the judge asked.  "A curse upon this retched country and all the filthy gits that live here!  May you all choke on your own bile and die gasping!"  was the response.

"May Ilmater bestow his mercy upon you!"  Cried the judge.

`May Ilmater withhold his merciful hand from you,' Eb thought briefly.  He lifted his greataxe and swung it downward in a well-practiced arc.  The cut was clean.  The cut was always clean.  Eb found execution to be more satisfying when they went out with a curse on their lips.  He felt this time to be particularly enjoyable and allowed himself a small grin.
