tAccording to Ilden's adopted father he was the son of a witch of some import to a barbarian band in Vaasa.  She was an evil minion of Zhengyi and served fervently in the war between her nation and Damara.  Ilden's father adopted him in the aftermath of the war hoping to redeem him of his less than righteous start in life.  Ilden's father was the spiritual leader of the Ilmater faith in Damara.  He never married and had no legitimate children.  Since the beginnings of the the church in Damara, its leadership role had been passed on be bloodline.  Through rite, Ilden is recognized as a blood relation to his father, and in this manner is his only living blood relation.  Ilden's legitimacy is held in question though due to his infernal background.  He has always been a well received member of the religion, even given some odd leniencies, but as a future leader his rights have always been in question.  After his father died,  pressure has built immensely in the church.  When Ilden comes to age, by tradition, he will assume leadership over the church in Damara, and the members of the church do not know whether it is worse to allow a fiend to take leadership of the church or to break a traditon that has been held by the church it began.

!-Journal of Ilden Thorn Date [[early chapter 2]

It was silent when I entered the temple, odd for a mourning, many people start their days here with offerings and prayers to our Suffering God.  As my father's son, my visits during these mornings often provide a raise of spirit that the people are desperately needing.  Really though I am just a face, and I will never understand how the people have gotten over my more vile nature.  I've been told that it is testament to our Suffering God and faith in him that I, a creature born from darker natures, has been turned to the light.  I don't buy it, neither do the hoods upstairs.  I wish, thought, that they didn't tie my hands up so that I am hardly capable of fullfilling the duties of my father's position.  Sorry, I digress.

The silence was odd and eary.  The flowers commonly kept in the temple were also wilted adding to the certainty that something was terribly wrong.  As I came to the front my eyes beheld the most horrible sight.  Before me were three Glabrazu devils.  In the middle of the vile grouping was a member of the clergy.  He had short dark hair caked with a mass of his owned blood mixed with devil's effused saliva and filth.  He had plain slender features, marred and twisted by cruel scarring.  His robe was missing, and the remains of red rope bindings on his forearms were the only thing to betray his affiliation with the broken one.  He was standing in pools of his own blood, and he hadn't made a sound to betray his pains.  Held tight to his breast was a simple black leather tome.

The instincts were instant.  My actions without doubt.  Before I had even assessed the scene, I had done the only thing there was to do.  In one quick dash forward I shoved the man out of the guantlet; though not immediately my intention, the consequence placed me in his former role.  There cuts ran deep into my skin.  I could feel the blood pouring from me.  It seemed like they had beat on me for hours but it had not even been a second.  They thought me finished quite quickly and turned to they're previous victim.

I was light headed.  I could think of barely anything but the pain.  I noticed I was clutching something. I think it was the book the man had.  Suddenly the breath rushed from my lungs.  In moments, words came to my mouth, words I did not know.  I knew many strange and useful words, but these words were new.  These words were stronger than any I had uttered before.  At the sound of my voice, the fiendss snapped to attention and looked to me, waiting.  The words brought themselves out of my mouth once more.  The devils quickly left the building.  I fell to the ground, and, in the last moments before I blacked out, I looked to the mans face, it was filled with care and sorrow, yet comforting.  His hand reached out to me just as the world melted away.

When I came to I was under the care of fellow men of the church.  They told me some muggers came into the church and started beating on an old man.  I had just walked in and started yelling at them and drove them out of the church.  Shortly after they said I mysteriously fainted.  I thought it all some delusion until I looked to the nightstand and saw that very book.  I asked, and they said the old man left it for me as a gift for my kindness.  On later inspection, I found large new scars on myself that could not have been made by myself.  The events have me quit confused.

I've perused the book, and it is my father's journal.  I do not know what to make of all this.  I have taken the book up as my own journal now; it only seemed fitting.  I am going to give it much further reading.  Hopefully things will explain themselves out.
