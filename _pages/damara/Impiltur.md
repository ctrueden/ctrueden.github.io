Impiltur is a kingdom of friendly merchants, preferring peace but capable of calculated acts of war when necessary.  While the Impilturans vigorously defend their own borders, the government traditionally remains neutral and leaves neighboring lands to defend themselves.  Impilturans see all sorts of raw valuables come from their northern neighbors and exotic goods arrive in their ports.
