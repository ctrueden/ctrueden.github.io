Jarcus Stormhand is a dwarven monk more commonly known as Lucky Jay. He is ((Krisbert Stormhand|Father Kris))'s younger brother. During the ((Zhengyi the Witch-King|Witch-King))'s reign in Heliogabalus, Kris and Jay, like many at the time, were arrested for a crime they did not commit. ((Captain Johan Strauss|Johan Strauss)), a young officer at the time, frowned upon such blatant disregard of justice within the city, and covertly arranged for a number of prisoners to escape, including Kris and Jay. The brothers fled the country, but returned after the Witch-King's defeat to repay their debt to Captain Strauss.

Jay is called &quot;lucky&quot; due to his notorious bad luck, belied by his irrepressible optimistic nature. (If he had not been in the wrong place at the wrong time, he and his brother would not have been arrested.) He looks up to his brother for Kris's great wisdom and patience.
