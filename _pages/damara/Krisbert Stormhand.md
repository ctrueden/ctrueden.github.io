Krisbert Stormhand is a dwarven cleric of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelemvor|Kelemvor] more commonly known as Father Kris. He is ((Jarcus Stormhand|Lucky Jay))'s older brother. During the ((Zhengyi the Witch-King|Witch-King))'s reign in Heliogabalus, Kris and Jay, like many at the time, were arrested for a crime they did not commit. ((Captain Johan Strauss|Johan Strauss)), a young officer at the time, frowned upon such blatant disregard of justice within the city, and covertly arranged for a number of prisoners to escape, including Kris and Jay. The brothers fled the country, but returned after the Witch-King's defeat to repay their debt to Captain Strauss.

Kris is called &quot;father&quot; due to his profession as a holy man, willingness to hear out anyone's problems, and offer good advice. Despite his reputation, though, Father Kris is quite shy and has to exert a lot of effort to deal with those who seek his advice. He looks up to his brother for Jay's gregariousness and fighting spirit.
