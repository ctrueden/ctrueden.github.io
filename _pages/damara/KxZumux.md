Kx'Zumux will compel any non-paladin to give him to a paladin as soon as possible, without undue risk to the bearer.  He will compel any paladin to attack the nearest evil dragon or dragonblooded creature.  He will not allow himself to be taken on any mission that does not give an apparent chance for it to kill an evil dragon or dragonblooded creature, and, even then, only in the hands of a paladin.

__bloodfire Power:__
For each Evil Dragon or Dragonblooded killed by Kx'Zumux the bearer acquires a bloodfire point.  The acquisition of points is made apparent by a thick glowing red steam that emites from the sword.  The bearer of the Kx'Zumux is limited to a number of bloodfire points equal to its HD.  If the bearer of Kx'Zumux has bloodfire points equal to his HD all the points are forced to be spent as a bloodfire strike in his next melee or ranged attack.  If the  bearer maintains bloodfire points equal to his HD for 5 rounds he is forced to expend them all in a bloodfire breath in the sixth round.  Bloodfire points reset after the mission.  Bloodfire points can not be acquired on any round in which bloodfire points are spent.  Bloodfire points may be spent in the following abilities:

||__bloodfire Healing__| Trade one bloodfire point for two points of healing with laying on hands.
__bloodfire Strike__| After rolling to hit but before success is determined spend points one for one to grant an accumaltive bloodfire bonus to Hit and Damage.
