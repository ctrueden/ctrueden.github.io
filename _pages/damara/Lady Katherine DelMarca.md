Talented Wizard of a once famous noble family, Katherine Del'Marca has spent the last 14 years of her life living in a hidden room in the sewers.  She has recently recovered from a madness induced by a traumatic event 14 years prior just before Gareth Dragonsbane assumed power.  This madness had been nurtured by lies her grandfather, Galvanger Del'Marca, had been telling her the whole time.  She is a kind-hearted and sweet woman in her early 20s who just happened to be raising the dead in the sewers and contributing to the Endless Undead Hordes.  She resides in the recovery ward of a temple of Ilmater in Heliogabalus and has almost finished clearing up the remains of her madness and has caught up on current events.

...She has reported to the clerics that she feels the sewers are pulling her or perhaps calling to her.  The clerics assure her that these feelings will pass in time.
