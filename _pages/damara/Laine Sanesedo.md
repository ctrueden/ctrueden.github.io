Laine is a peasant girl by birth, but she is passionate, kind, and wise beyond her years, with the heart of a true warrior. When the recent war turned really ugly, she dressed as a boy and joined the army. Due to her talent, she quickly rose to the top of her class, and was recruited into a group of elite new recruits trained by the master at arms himself, ((Sir Kerrick Stokesworth)), who also took notice of her skill.

But one day a jealous fellow recruit (in whom she had naively confided her secret) revealed that Laine was a girl, and she was forced out of the royal forces. Though the Bear could not publically continue her training, he could not stand to see her talent go to waste, nor her heart go unfulfilled -- so he continued to train her in secret.

Impressed by ((King Gareth Dragonsbane))'s ideals, Laine pledged herself to Ilmater, and became one of his paladins. During the final battles of the war, Laine begged Stokesworth to lend her a sword and suit of armor so that she could fight, and her teacher managed to scrounge up a patchwork sufficient to protect her. When she first rode to battle, she wore a helm to hide the fact that she was a woman -- but her combat prowess, combined with her application of divine power against the undead hordes, made her very distinctive, and when a hammer blow dislodged her helmet, she was thereafter known as the &quot;lady paladin.&quot;

After what happened during her training, Laine is slow to trust other people, but once she does, she is a tremendously dedicated friend. Though she has distinguished herself in a number of battles and been awarded treasures for her service to Damara on multiple occasions, she has declined offers from lords to fashion her new armor, instead continuing to wear the patchwork plate that the Bear illicitly assembled for her.
