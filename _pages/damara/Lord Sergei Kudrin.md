Sergei was one of the Twelve Lords of Imphras.  He was also known as High Diviner of Impiltur until his mysterious disappearance.  He's a geshtalt Paladin/Wizard of Mystra specializing in divination.  He has a Hound archon familiar named ((Kennedy)) who Mystra gave to him in place of a paladin mount.

Sergei has been imprisoned in a temporal stasis since the beginning of Zhengyi's second invasion.  Recently freed by some of Damara's up-and-coming magic user types, he has agreed to aid Damara until the Impostor King of Impiltur is dethroned and the real Arorhan Imphras ascends to his rightful place.

Note to GMs:  Being a freakin' high level diviner, Sergei shall be able to provide important info, and thus, quests.
