A stately 18 years of age, the Lord Tevren Whitefield though encumbered with ((Marquess Harod Whitefield|his father's)) name, is at heart a child in the Dragonsbane lineage.  His mother, thankful for the opportunity to spend less time with the Marquess had devoted as much of her time as possible into raising her son in the manner of regalty befitting the line, and had engrained in him ferocious loyalty to it.  Following her death Tevren determined to invest his time and efforts into personally reforming the Whitefield house into an establishment worthy of the praises he was fed through childhood.  His religious devotion to elevating the family name finds him at constant odds with his stepmother ((Lady Tielra Whitefield|Ti'elra)), as both are slowly prying the authority from beneath the aging and inattentive Marquess.
