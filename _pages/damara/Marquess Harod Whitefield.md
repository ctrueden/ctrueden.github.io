Harod Whitefield married the niece of ______ Dragonsbane in a prearranged agreement whereby the Whitefield famly became a high noble house in Damara (as well as directly linked to the Dragonsbane line) in exchange for the unification of the land owned by the Whitefield famly coming under the now unified Damara (and thus subject to the royal taxes rather than the Whitefield's).  The marriage never surpassed it's initial purpose and, despite the birth of the young ((Lord Tevren Whitefield|Lord Tevren)), there was no emotion beyond the political facade of a courtly couple.  There was much proclaimed distress when the Lady Whitefield died of illness during the chill winter months many years later.  However, after a socially appropriate period of mourning, Marquess Whitefield took ((Lady Tielra Whitefield|Ti'elra)), previously advisor to the Marquess, as his new wife.
