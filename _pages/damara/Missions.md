Missions are the real meat of the campaign.  Instead of being party driven the ((Damaran Chronicles)) are location based, and so questing is done by going on these Missions.

*In general, each mission should take about 1 session to play through.

*For Pool Missions, players may use any PC from the pool. There is no limit to the number of times a pool character may be used in a chapter. Story characters may be played in pool missions, but only with GM permission.

*Those missions marked as ((Story Missions)) require story characters (((Primary)) or ((Secondary))).

*Each story character may participate in one mission per chapter (either story or pool). Players are also given one &quot;extra&quot; story character use per chapter (either primary or secondary). So you could choose to play your primary twice and secondary once, or vice versa -- but not both twice.
