Mook was a basket weaver's apprentice until he was conscripted into the Damaran army (along with everyone else). Under the expert training of ((Sir Kerrick Stokesworth|Sir Kerrick)) he has become an able young warrior. Nonetheless, his survival of the many recent battles is due more to luck than skill. With a nickname like Mook, it's a miracle something untimely hasn't already happened to him...
