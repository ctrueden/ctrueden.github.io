A country where only the strong survive, Narfell is a land of infertile soil that supports only scraggly grass.  The people of Narfell are tribal folk called the Nars, fierce horse-riders who believe that all people are judged by their actions.  Their motto, &quot;Deed, not blood,&quot; shows their disregard for those who expect deference because of &quot;noble&quot; birth.  Some of the tribes are hostile to outsiders, bu all set aside their differences once a year for their great trademeet.
