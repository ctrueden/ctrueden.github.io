Also known as the Disciples of Saint Sollars, this solitary monastery of ((Ilmater)) worshippers in the ((Earthspur Mountains)) of ((Damara)) is known for loyalty to its allies and destruction to its enemies.  Greatly respected on matters of truth and diplomacy, the monks work hard to survive in their harsh remote sanctuary.  The monks often travel with Ilmataran paladins, particularly from the ((Order of the Golden Cup)).  They may multiclass freely as rangers and shadowdancer.
