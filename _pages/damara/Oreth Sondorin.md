Magical Advisor to the royals and head of the research laboratories and ((Royal Magicians Guild)) in the castle at heliogabalus, Oreth is known to be a bit of a recluse and coward, although noone questions his intelligence.  However, many question his loyalties as he spent much of the second war with Vaasa holed up in the castle.  He claims that he was just researching ways to help the troops, but nothing seemed to come of it.  In fact, now that the war is over, he has been coming out into the capital less and less.  Some of his acolytes have tried convincing people that Oreth is just embarrassed since an accident in one of the labs caused a strange affect on him, but most people still believe he is hiding from the threats and jeers of cowardice people throw at him whenever he passes by.  Yeah, that must be it!
