The Platinum Scale clan was founded 120 years ago as a splinter group from the Bloodfire Kobolds of Vaasa.  Consisting of kobolds formerly enslaved and/or disenfranchised kobolds by the red dragon patron of Bloodfire Kobolds, the Abyssian Dragon Fyrillius.  Kezilx[[The lesser], then named Fraxamut, lead a revolt against the leadership of the Bloodfire Kobolds and then formed a new tribe as the new All-Watcher of the escaping kobolds, all with the help and patronage of a silver dragon named Kezilx[[The Greater].  Under the new leadership the tribe blossomed and grew at an unheard of rate even among kobolds.

During the conflict between Vaasa and Damara the Platinum Scale directly warred with the Bloodfires.  With the help of King Dragonsbane and Kezilx[[The Greater], The Fyrillius and the Bloodfires were eliminated.  After the war, Fraxamut gave up control of the Platinum Scale Clan.  He was then adopted by Kezilx[[The Greater], changed his name, and gained recognition as a dragon.  The clan split into three recognized tribes, divided on differing philosophies, being progressive, isolationist, and traditionalist ideals (LG, LN, LE), each with its own All-Watcher.  The tribes all share the same den and are known as the The Silver Eye Tribe, The Dragon eye Tribe, and The Red Eye Tribe.  All of them pay homage to Kezilx The Lesser and Greater as patrons of the whole clan.
