A pool character is a follower of one of the ((Primary)) or ((Secondary)) characters. See the ((People)) page for a list of pool characters.

Instead of the normal followers table given by the Leadership feat, each story character (liege) can have followers whose levels total his Leadership score (computed as normal), excluding cohorts. See the &quot;Pool Characters and Leadership&quot; section of ((Character Creation)) for more details.
