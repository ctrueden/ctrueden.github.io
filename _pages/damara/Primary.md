The Primary characters begin at a fairly low level, but are important in several ways.

*Each Primary character is important in some way to the leadership of ((Damara)).  Many are royalty, and those that aren't are still tied to a greater destiny than normal residents of ((Damara)).

*Primary characters are ((Gestalt)), and are in general vastly more powerful than other characters of their level.

*Many ((Story Missions)) require the use of Primary characters, and will include challenges appropriate to the power level of the Primary characters.
