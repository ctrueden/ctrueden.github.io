Sarah Dragonsbane is the daughter of the late King Gareth Dragonsbane...which makes her the new queen and ruler of Damara, so she's not really a princess anymore.

She's 13 years old, 4'7&quot; tall, 91 lbs. has sky blue eyes and long voluminous blonde hair reaching down to her lower back.  Her skin is clear, smooth, and pale (more a result of the northern environment than of genes).  Before her father died she seemed to be a happy, outgoing, innocent, carefree youth: A symbol of the prosperity King Dragonsbane worked so hard to achieve for his country his entire life.  Though under the innocent facade, she understood more than her appearance would indicate and always hoped that her father would stay alive so she would never have to don the mantle of responsibility herself.  Now that her father is gone, she has taken on a more visibly independent and dutiful persona.  She hopes to rebuild Damara and contiue her father's work of making it a prosperous and safe nation.

Talent Manifest:  How they came to love the Princess.

Young Sarah was known to favor trips through Heliogabalus whenever she could.  She enjoyed meeting all the unique people and learn all she could about them.  They would always smile and bow and Sarah could not but love each and every one of them.  Her father felt protective and worried as all good fathers feel for their innocent inexperienced children.  When he was too busy to accompany his daughter, he would always sent with her an escort of no fewer than ten of his most trusted veteran soldiers.  On one such outing, Sarah witnesses a violent mugging.  The victim had been stabbed in the torso and was bleeding to death while the mugger sped off with two of the soldiers at his heels.  A woman screamed.  She ran over to the wounded man, kneeled down, and began calling his name over and over again.  A crowd had formed and one of the soldiers determined that the victim had only a few minutes to live.  He raised his voice and shouted for a healer.  No one stepped forward.  The woman wailed and said, "He is my husband!  We have two children!  He's a good man!  We won't be able to survive without him!"  Then she began flailing around hysterically.  One of the soldiers had to restrain her.  "We are too far from the castle or any churches, this man will not survive long enough for a healer to arrive", the soldier claimed.  Sarah, not understanding and a bit frightened by the scene, asked, "Why don't you just heal him?  I see father healing people all the time."  The soldier responded, "If your father were here he could heal this man, yes.  But his is a rare talent which very few possess and none of us here can do it."  "That's silly!" She exclaimed.  She walked up to the wounded man, kneeled over him, and placed her hands upon his bloody torso.  "He does it like this," Sarah explained matter-of-factly.  Imitating her father, she muttered a short prayer to Ilmater to save this man.  A glow began to emit from Sarah's hands.  The man's blood cleared away and everyone could see the wound mend itself.  "See?  Just like that," she smiled as all children do when they know they have done something praiseworthy.  The entire audience gaped in awe.  The wife ran over, dived upon her husband and kissed him fervently.  Murmurs rippled throughout the crowd.  "The princess just saved that man's life.  How is that possible?  She's too young to be able to do that.  Ilmater must favor her.  She is the daughter of the king, it must run in the family."  And so on.  After the reunion with her husband, the wife bowed deeply before Sarah and proclaimed, "I am yours until the end, princess."  Shortly thereafter, someone in the crowd began chanting, "Sarah! Sarah!"  The crowd decided to follow the lead and eventually everyone began chanting her name loudly.  She had time to blush in embarrassment before her soldiers indicated to her that it was time to return to the castle.
