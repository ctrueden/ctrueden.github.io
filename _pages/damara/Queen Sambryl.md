Former Queen of ((Impiltur)), her reign was good an just, and she was loved by her people.  Widowed soon after the birth of her son, the crown prince ((King Arorhon Imphras|Arorhon)), she soon found the burden of rulership to be boring.  Placing the actual administration of ((Impiltur)) in the capable hands of ((the Twelve Lords of Imphras II)), she traveled the land helping her people with their individual problems.  Her recent assassination, supposedly at the hands of the Damaran royal emissary (((Baron Donlevy the Young))), has been a disastrous blow to ((Impiltur)), and the nation now prepares to raise arms against ((Damara)) at the insistence of now ((King Arorhon Imphras|King Arorhon)).
