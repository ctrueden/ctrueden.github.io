Re: "The Red Angel" Kyria Shirako

Ask, and ye shall receive. This is the culmination of months of `sneaking about,' `gathering information,' and `pointing sharp things at genitals.' Or it would be if your "Red Angel" hadn't left so painfully easy a path to follow.

I never get to have any fun.

"The Red Angel" is merely a sorcerer by the name of Kyria Shirako, and it's a name with little substance behind it, merely a persona by which she fancies herself. Perhaps more meaningful would be the moniker she has earned in more than one domain: "Friendly Fire," which nicely alludes to her bubbly, cheerful personality, her talent for pyromancy, and a seemingly pathological inability early in her career to properly calculate blast radii.

She hails initially from Thay, (Laprendar Tharch, City of Amurathar) which alone loosely explains three things about her: Her pursuit of (if not obsession with) arcane power, her worship of the flame-deity Kossuth, and what the hells she, given that she is a sorceress, is doing all the way over in the Silver Marches.

The first significant event in a pampered childhood under the parentage of a wealthy and successful Thayan merchant family was the awakening of her sorcerous power -- which unfortunately awakened in the form of a Burning Hands spell in an upscale exotic pet shop. Her parents, being practical people, quickly turned her over to the Red Wizards for training in exchange for not being thrown into six dungeons at once for arson, a fate the Wizard in question assured them was A) 'entirely possible,' B) 'full of scorpions,' and C) 'not the nice kind.'

Kyria would find that the feel of fire, the sheer &gt;rush&lt; of barely focused magic flowing from her fingertips would be a driving addiction in her life, one she would find few occasions to curb. Thus, despite the promise of power, attempts to train her as a Red Wizard apparently went quite poorly. While the details are not privy to even my eyes, it's not hard to imagine that her instructor saw her as an unruly, dangerous sorcerer who couldn't be bothered to point a wand where it wouldn't destroy valuable property, and she saw her instructor as an overbearing tyrant who got all huffy over little pet peeves like 'needing skin grafts' and 'incinerating my familiar.'

These differences, whatever they might have been, soon saw her sneaking away on a caravan out to all important Elsewhere. Pursuit was minimal; It is entirely possible her instructor considered her unannounced departure a blessing and only set out the most token of investigations for appearances' sake.

She's spent years since traveling all over Faerun; It's a certainty that she's at least visited Sembia, where her talents caught the eye of then-Usurer Galvan Kasen, who registered her services before enacting his Plan (See report 24B). She's generally willing to work fairly cheap, because it's not money that motivates her; She will go some distance for the mere opportunity to combust things with official sanction and total impunity.

Her overall goals seem to be those of any other sorcerer; Peace, justice, and the ability to blow a bus in half.

Let it be noted that she will happily settle for one out of three.
