The Red Eye tribe hearing a bent version of the events of Damaran assault during the tax collection voices further dissent over joining the Damaran kingdom.  Dissent eventually breaks into the first violence to take place among the Platinum Scale kobolds.  After all is said and done, the Red Eye tribe leaves the ((Platinum Scale Clan)) and heads to Vaasa under new leadership. (The ((Platinum Scale Clan)) loses the LE alignment and Tiamat religion)
