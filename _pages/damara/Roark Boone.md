Roark is an unruly half-orc warrior who caused trouble within his unit until ((Talos)) took command and made an example of Roark by defeating him in combat. Despite the fact that Talos cut off one of Roark's fingers as a demonstration of authority (maybe ''because'' of it), Roark has been strangely loyal to Talos ever since.
