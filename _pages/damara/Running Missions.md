!!Pool Missions
You can design and run your own ((Missions|pool mission)). If you want to do so, here are some things to keep in mind:
*The level range of the mission must allow it to be challenged with available ((People|pool characters)).
*To list your mission, you must update the ((Available Missions)) page.
*You need not have the mission fully designed before posting it. In fact, you are encouraged to post ideas early, so that there are more available missions listed. Players always choose their missions one week in advance, giving you time to finish preparing the mission once it has been chosen.
*Once the mission is complete, you must remove your mission from ((Available Missions)), moving it to the ((Completed Missions)) page. You must list all rewards earned, or they will not be tallied properly at the end of the chapter.

!!Story Missions
You can design and run your own ((Story Missions|story mission)). However, story missions are posted only at the beginning of each chapter, and can have more far-reaching on the campaign.
*If you want to run a story mission, attend the ((Wrap-Up)) session for a chapter and propose your idea.
*If the other wrap-up participants like it, we'll collaborate and add it to the available story missions for the chapter.
*Once the mission is complete, you must remove your mission from ((Available Missions)), moving it to the ((Completed Missions)) page. You must list all rewards earned, or they will not be tallied properly at the end of the chapter.

!!What to Unlock
When deciding the rewards for your mission, there are no hard limitations, but please use good judgment. For statistics, 1-2 is considered a &quot;small&quot; change, 5 is &quot;moderate,&quot; and 10 is &quot;large.&quot; A change of more than 10 is very rare, and should have a very solid justification. When deciding what to unlock, consider the long term picture; instead of unlocking many things at once, think about how to stretch into multiple missions that could unlock a couple things each.
