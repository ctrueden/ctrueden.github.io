A genial young priest of Lathander who enjoys acting as an emissary whenever his master ((Oreth Sondorin|Oreth)) doesn't need him for Divine magic study.  He is almost always smiling and looking at others in awe.  He is good friends with ((Raine Dragonsbane)), although that is what he would like to think, but in reality, he just shadows Raine around ((Heliogabalus)) and the ((Monastary of the Yellow Rose)).  He has been known for his exceptional ability of handling the dead and the undead.
