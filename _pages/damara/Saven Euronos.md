Head of the ((Order of the Yellow rose)), this venerable middle-aged man is well known for his wisdom, compassion, divine powers and martial fighting skills.  He leads the many disciples of Ilmater who have cloistered themselves in the ((Monastary of the Yellow Rose)) and educates many of the new recruits in everything from battle strategies for war, to respect and understanding of the harsh natural world.

He inherited the command of leadership after the previous High Priest stepped down from the position and nominated him, and he has held the position well for over ten years, garnering great respect from every citizen in Damara.  It is known by many that he is the close mentor of ((Raine Dragonsbane)) and has entrusted the young man with much of his knowledge.  Some have suggested that Raine would succeed Lord Euronos as the head of the Monastary, but most realize that this is just false speculation as it seems that Raine does not even worship Ilmater.
