Sergeant Swatler is in charge of the barricade at sewer entrance 4.  He commands 23 soldiers at the barricade, 20 fighters and 3 clerics.  He does not like his job.  Though not an evil man, he is more than willing to send foolhardy unprepared adventurers into the labrynthian sewers in hopes that some day the sewers will be cleared of threats and he can go on to do something more productive.
