This is the area in the portion of Damara just south of the ((Great Glacier)) itself. The land is harsh and filled with danger, as a number of marauding tribes roam the area. Some claim the roving monsters were spawned from the evil of the glacier, but there are those who brave the risks to live in a place filled with beauty and wonder, largely free of governmental influence.

There is no infrastructure or sophistication to the land, and those who live there feel little if any allegiance to Damara, but do not pose much threat as long as they are left alone.
