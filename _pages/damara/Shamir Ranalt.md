Shamir is a wealthy merchant who specializes in gem cutting and the buying and selling of magical items.  Once the head of a far-flung trading empire, his holdings have been vastly reduced since the war with Vaasa.  The majority of his current assets lie in Trail's End, where he resides with his daughter, ((Danrelle Ranalt|Danrelle)), whom he is grooming to take over the business one day.
