-=Silvanus (greater god)=-
Oak Father, the Forest Father, Treefather

__Symbol:__ Green living oak leaf
__Alignment:__ N
__Portfolio:__ Wild nature, druids
__Domains:__ Animal, Plant, Protection, Renewal, Water
__Favored Weapon:__ maul
__Dogma:__ Silvanus sees and balances all, meting out wild water and drought, fire and ice, life and death.  Hold your distance and take in the total situation, rather than latching onto the popular idea of what is best.  All is in a cycle, deftly and beautifully balanced.  It is the duty of the devout to see this cycle and the sacred Balance as clearly as possible.  Make others see the balance and work against those that would disturb it.  Watch, anticipate, and quietly manipulate.  Resort to open confrontation only when pressured by time or hostile action.  Fight against the felling of forests, banish disease wherever you find it, defend the trees, and plant new flora wherever possible.  Kill only when needful, and destroy fire and its employers.
