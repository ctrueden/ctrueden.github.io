During the first war with the ((Zhengyi the Witch-King|Witch-King)), a young human cavalryman distinguished himself.  With a bit of skill, and a lot of luck, Kerrick &quot;The Bear&quot; Stokesworth managed to play a decisive role in several battles, and was knighted for his valor.  After the defeat of the Witch-King, he was given the position of Master of Arms, in charge of overseeing the martial training and practice of the Royal Guard and young nobles, among other duties.

In the times of relative peace, however, the Bear's once impressive skills have rusted.  It's obvious that he loves food more than any woman; he can no longer fit into his suit of full plate, and is almost too fat to ride his newest steed, Fury.

Though he appears slow and ponderous, however, the heart of a knight beats within him.  In these newly tumultuous times, it's clear that Damara needs him to be at his best, and he will rise to the challenge or die trying.

-=Description:=-

Sir Kerrick is 6 feet tall, and weighs about 270 pounds.  He is quick with a joke and a smile.  He has a weak spot for people with good hearts.
