This 3-inch-diameter silver sphere is the property of Talisen Orcslayer, a master chef from Silverymoon who is currently staying in Heliogabalus.  When spells of level 1 through 6 are cast into the sphere, faint silvery runes glow and flicker across the surface.  The magic is transmuted as follows (the caster level remains the same):

Level of Spell - Spell Effect
1 - Feather Fall
2 - Levitate
3 - Fly
4 - Air Walk
5 - Overland Flight
6 - Wind Walk

Talisen will let any of the PCs use the sphere, but will be loathe to let it out of his possession.  It remains an effective way to move individuals out of Heliogabalus.
