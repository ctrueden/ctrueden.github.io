Azar is the head of the ((Great Glacier Tradition)), an animist cult that venerates the spirits of animals and geographical features of the cold lands.

-=Description=-

Azar is a short woman, but still quite an imposing figure due to the elk-antler headdress she wears as a sign of her position in the cult.
