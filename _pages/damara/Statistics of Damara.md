The statistics for the regions will affect the statistics for the country, with each Controlled region having its entire effect, each Contested region granting 50% of its changes, and each Uncontrolled region yielding 25% of its effects to the country as a whole. 
Every chapter at wrap-up, regional statistics will be updated to reflect missions and civic actions.  Subsequently, country statistics will be changed to reflect the new regional statistics.  Finally, the wealth of Damara will increase based on Damara's Trade statistic, with a percentage of the wealth lost equal to Bandit Activity.  In other words, if Bandit Activity is less than 100, Damara's wealth as a whole will increase, while if it is greater than 100, Damara's treasury will be slowly stripped dry by the humanoid parasites.
