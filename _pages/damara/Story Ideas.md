This page lists ideas we may use in future chapters for the storyline.

Brought up during Chapter 2 ((Wrap-Up)) but dropped:
*Greg: 1st chapter mission about ghosts in dwarven stuff under city
some kind of construct escaped -- bring that up for chapter 3 plot
*Svirfneblin may be allies to Damara
*((Ewan Dragonsbane)) -- put pressure on bandit leader to work for him

Planned for Chapter 3 ((Wrap-Up)) -- various pieces of information and events will prompt ((Princess Sarah Dragonsbane|Sarah)) to publically proclaim (as a ((Royal Decrees|Royal Decree))) that ((Impiltur)) is corrupt. This announcement paves the way for possible Chapter 4 story missions:
*Infiltrate ((Impiltur)) to gather information
*Sabotage ((Impiltur))'s war effort
*Assassinate the false leader
*First battle of a war with ((Impiltur))
