Story Missions are special ((Missions)) that progress the overall story arc of the campaign.  Unlike normal ((Missions)), the players must play their ((Primary)) or ((Secondary)) character, as appropriate to the specific Story Mission.

Each story character may participate in one mission per chapter (either story or pool). Players are also given one &quot;extra&quot; story character use per chapter (either primary or secondary). So you could choose to play your primary twice and secondary once, or vice versa -- but not both twice.

It is possible to use a pool character on a story mission, but only if there are extra character slots that need to be filled, and no other story character is available to do so.
