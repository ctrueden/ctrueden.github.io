The Lord Suou Daidoji hails from the far eastern empire of Shou Lung on the continent of Kara Tur.

-=The Story=-

__The Crane Clan and the Daidoji family:__  Members of the Crane clan are noted diplomats, performers, and artists.  Many, such as the members of the Daidoji family, are tall and slender, with white hair and pale eyes.  As the Daidoji are a noble family, most of the male members are samurai, and are reknowned for their grace and tact.  Although young Suou, as the heir of the family, was expected to follow the path of bushido like his father before him, his teachers found that he lacked the discipline for such a path.

__Young Suou and the Wu Jen:__ It caused no small amount of controversy within the Daidoji family when Suou persisted in his fascination with the ways of magic.  It was finally agreed that there was more honor to be found by a skilled wu jen than an unskilled samurai, and a fine hengeyokai tutor was hired.

__The Dishonorable Path:__ Suou's tutor provided not only instruction in the magical arts, but also directed the boy to men who could address his darker curiosities.  When the lord discovered that his son, the Daidoji heir, was training in the ways of the ninja like a common assassin, it was clear that something must be changed before dishonor fell on the Daidoji family.  The high-ranking members of the family agreed to send the boy to the West, where they were currently negotiating a trade agreement with a noble family in the kingdom of Damara.  The noble family would be exceptionally honored to be tied to such a prestigious family, and when Suou returned to claim his inheritance (if he returned), any odd behavior could be blamed on exposure to the strange and barbaric culture of the western lands.  In the meantime, Suou's younger brother would become the ''de facto'' heir of the Daidoji family.

__The Significance of the Sword:__ Though Suou's father never told him what had been discovered, a gift made any conversation unnecessary.  When Suou was told that he was being sent west to be married to a young noblewoman, he was given a sword by his father.  That the sword was an heirloom, once used for great deeds by a Daidoji and passed down throughout the generations spoke highly of Suou's tie to the family, and the honor of his heritage.  However, it was rusted from nearly a century of nonuse, though one would not know this until the blade was drawn.  As his sword is the soul of a samurai, the message was unmistakeable; Suou's father does not regard him as a warrior, and he is not expected to contribute to the honorable history of the sword.  Worse is that the sword is a katana originally forged for a woman, making it smaller and lighter than a normal katana.  Between a normal katana and a wakizashi in size, it is very similar to the ninja-to.  And so Suou came to understand the true reason for his father's actions, and did not question them.  He wears the sword with a mixture of pride and shame, for although the sword represents dishonor, it still represents the potential for honor to be regained.
