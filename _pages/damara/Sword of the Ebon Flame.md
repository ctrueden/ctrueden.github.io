The Sword of the Ebon Flame is a +2 Anarchic, Unholy longsword with some special properties.  It appears to be a standard longsword, the face and edge of which have faint, flickering black flames upon it, though they do not radiate warmth.  When used, it bursts into black flame which does not harm the wielder.  Anyone struck by the sword takes 1d10 points of fire damage in addition to the standard damage, and must roll a reflex save (DC 16) or catch fire for 1d6 rounds.  This ebon flame cannot be doused by any non-magical means, including water.  Thus, the flaming ability of the sword (including setting opponents on fire) functions normally under water.

When held, unsheathed, the wielder gains 30' darkvision if he does not already have darkvision.  The sword functions at -3 vs demons, and any demons within 60' of the sword automatically know its location and powers.  Most demons will attack the wielder, seeking to gain the sword for their own.
