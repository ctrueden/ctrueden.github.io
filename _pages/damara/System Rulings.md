-=Caster Levels=-

When gaining a caster level, you may add it to any classes spell progression you like.  However, your character's base caster level and spell progression are capped at your total level.

''For example: Upon attaining 6th level a gestalt character chooses wizard/arcane trickster as his gestalt level.''  
If wizard was his only arcane caster class, but he was only 3rd caster level, he would add both caster levels to that progression, attaining caster level 5 in that class.

If wizard was his only arcane caster level and was already at 5, he would add both caster levels to that progression, but he would still be limited to caster level 6 (plus in game modifiers), and have daily spells equivalent to a 6th level wizard.

If wizard was not his only arcane caster class he could distribute the 2 caster levels he gained in any way he chose, even choosing to gain more caster levels in a certain progression than he can use.

''Note:'' Caster levels beyond what you can use don't disappear.  As soon as your base level is high enough to use them they are available as normal.

-=Fractionals=-

For those class abilities listed below you gain a fraction of the ability at each level, instead of gaining the full ability at each specified level.  To figure out the fractional, just take the number of times that ability appears on the class progression and divide it by the total # of levels of the class.

Caster Levels
Sneak Attack**
Base Attack Bonus
Saving Throws
Hit Points

**When a character takes his first level in his first class with Sneak Attack (as a first level ability), he gains +1d6 Sneak Attack.  At all further points, all classes that grant a Sneak Attack bonus give their appropriate fractional bonus.  For example, Rogues get +1d6 Sneak Attack at first level, and +.5d6 at every subsequent level.  A character's sneak attack can never be higher than (.5*character level)+.5. 

-=Psionics=-

Psionics are just another form of magic in this campaign.  SR and PR are entirely interchangable, and any effect that dispels, detects, negates, or otherwise affects magic will work exactly the same way against psionics, and vice versa.

-=Other=-

*Changes in permanent Intelligence change a character's total skill points retroactively. 
*Obscure Lore works on both Bardic Knowledge and Lore, if the character has both class features. 
*Master Spellthief allows you to store the higher-level spells you steal. 
*You cannot purchase magic items from someone else.
