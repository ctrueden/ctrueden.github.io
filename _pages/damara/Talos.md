Talos is an evil creature whose tribe, the Drel'guul, makes its home upon the ((Great Glacier)). His people believe in the creed of &quot;might makes right,&quot; simultaneously respecting the gods for their awesome power, and hating them as well, as they covet the gods' position and seek to make it their own. The Drel'guul are extremely hostile toward all outsiders, and nearly always attack both individual and small groups of travelers on sight.

They also fight amongst one another when they sense weakness or opportunity for personal advancement within the tribe. Bitter feuds have come very close to destroying the tribe many times in the past, but a strong leader has always emerged to galvanize the tribe's remains and rebuild it -- for instance, Talos took that name upon himself ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos_%28Forgotten_Realms%29|Talos, god of storms and chaos]) when he slew the previous tribe leader and took control of the tribe.

Unfortunately for him, several years later (two decades from the campaign's beginning), Talos was captured by ((Ramses Tremier|Ramses)) and ((Dahlia Tremier|Dahlia)) Tremier. Since Dahlia was a new mother at the time, she and her husband decided to use ((Zhengyi the Witch-King|Zhengyi's)) dark power to create a blood bond between Talos and their infant son ((Gareth Tremier|Soren)). As a result of the ritual, Talos was bound to serve the child as his absolute master for all eternity.

But the blood bond drew its strength from the Witch-King's power, and when Zhengyi fell in battle, the bond fell dormant. Free once more, Talos slew Ramses in a fury, then returned to the Drel'guul to reclaim his place as tribe ruler, knowing that a rival had undoubtably usurped his position in his absence. After a bloody struggle, he was able to reclaim his position as tribe leader, and the Drel'guul spread chaos and destruction under Talos's reign for many years.

When the Witch-King's phylactery was stolen and Zhengyi began to reawaken, however, the power of the blood bond, forgotten after so many years, began to reassert itself. Soon, Talos was compelled to leave the glacier and travel to ((Heliogabalus)) to find the boy whom he served.

When he presented himself to Soren (now known as Gareth), the boy was very surprised. Unsure of what to do with this barbarian standing before him, Gareth sought the advice of ((King Gareth Dragonsbane|King Dragonsbane)). &quot;If he is truly bound to obey you, make him swear allegiance to Damara,&quot; suggested the king. Gareth agreed, and Talos was forced to swear an oath of service to Damara. As an able war leader, Talos was then conscripted into the Damaran army, and ordered to serve as a military commander, where he put his fearsome skills to use as a lieutenant, cowing the most unruly units into submission beneath his iron fist.

Gareth's mother Dahlia had not forgotten Talos. She realized that his return meant the blood bond had reawakened, which heralded the imminent return of the Witch-King. Without a word to anyone, filled with renewed hope and lust for power, she slipped away from the city to rejoin her former master.

After the Witch-King's final defeat, Talos was hoping to be free of the blood bond once and for all, but King Dragonsbane's sacrifice reacted strangely with the magic. Rather than destroying the bond forever, it somehow solidified it even further -- as though the Witch-King's power was severed from Zhengyi personally and had become a standalone force. Talos is now compelled to return to Gareth's side and protect him during the ensuing chaos, lest the boy be slain, for should Gareth die, Talos dies as well.
