No one, not even Oreth, knows him by any other name.  Orphaned at a very young age, Teeple bagan as an infamous thief who ran all over Heliogabalus.  Rumors spread that he acted like somewhat of a Robin Hood type character as he used a portion of what he stole to feed and care for many homeless people around the capital.  Oreth saw the good in the young thief and upon their meeting (a situation involoving Oreth catching the boy trying to pawn off his royal mage guild seal) decided to take the short young man under his wing.  Under Oreth's tutelage, the boy excelled at arcane study, advancing well beyond many of the other apprentice mages in the royal guild, and he soon became Oreth's right hand man.  Now, in the wake of the Witch-King's second attack, Teeple works to find ways that he can help anyone who is in need of helping.  He often expresses a desire to join a renowned organization called the Daggerspell Guardians but currently lacks a way to join and someone to sponsor him.

Teeple stands only 4'0&quot; tall so many mistake him for a halfling, even though he insists he just needs to go through his growth spurt.  Since it is believed that his parents died when he was young, no one really knows what race he belongs to.
