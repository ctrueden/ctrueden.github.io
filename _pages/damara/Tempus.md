-=Tempus (greater god)=-
Lord of Battles, Foehammer

__Symbol:__ A blazing sword on a blood-red shield
__Alignment:__ CN
__Portfolio:__ War, battle, warriors
__Domains:__ Chaos, Protection, Strength, War
__Favored Weapon:__ battleaxe
__Dogma:__ Tempus does not win battles, he helps the deserving warrior win battles.  War is fair in that it oppresses and aids all equally.  It should not be feared, but seen as a natural force, a storm brought by civilization.  Arm all for whom battle is needful, even foes.  Retreat from hopeless fights but never avoid battle.  Slay one foe decisively and halt a battle quickly rather than rely upon slow attrition.  Remember the dead that fell before you.  Disparage no foe and respect all, for valor blazes in all regardless of age, sex, or race.  Tempus looks with favor upon those that acquit themselves honorably in battle without resorting to craven tricks.  Consider the consequences of the violence of war, and do not wage war recklessly.  The smooth-tounged that avoid all strife wreak more harm than the most energetic tyrant.
