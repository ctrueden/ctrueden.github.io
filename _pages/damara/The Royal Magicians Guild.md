Headquarters in one of the Eastern Towers of the castle in Heliogabalus, the Royal Magicians guild is really more of a research organization that has been sponsored by the royal family for over twenty years.  Lead by ((Oreth Sondorin|High Mage Oreth Sondorin)), the small but intelligent group works to develop new spells and magical artifacts as well as identifying the properties of newly acquired items for the nobles.  They are often the go to group whenever a magical consultation is needed.
