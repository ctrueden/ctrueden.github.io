Allowing new items (e.g. Alchemist's Frost), or custom created magical items

!-Notes From Chapter 4 Wrap-up
*Characters should be levelled up: Primaries are now level 5, secondaries level 10.
Unlocking has been completely scrapped
*Since it only mattered to the Pool characters anyway, and nobody really ever plays those, unlocking has been scrapped.  There is some talk about unlocking unit types for a mass combat system, and the possibility of new items (not discussed)
GM incentives
*Tabling this for now
Country-building system
*We're using the Reign company system for now to simulate what's going on in the background with bandits and such.  Contact Greg for more details.
Who would win in a fight - Batman or Drizzt Do'Urden?
*One way to find out.  Get out the knives!

As the DMG 
*Rebuilding / Retraining / No rules?
No rules 
*Group veto for things we decide are too broken / stupid to have in the game
YES, but use sparingly 
*Buying magic items created by other characters (particularly pool characters) 
NO 
*Civic actions to create stat-increasing buildings (as per Griffin's suggestion) 
YES 
*Retroactive skill points for Intelligence increases? 
YES 
*How exactly are bloodlines working in combination with gestalt levels? 
DISCUSS LATER 
*Are we keeping the extra stuff that is in the Campaign Setting, and if so, do people get one item or everything?  How would the scrolls work?
NO, not keeping them 
*Alignment changes (does torturing people make you evil?)
YES -- Allen's nameless secondary character should now be Neutral Evil instead of Neutral. 
*Will Flaws and traits exist for pool characters?  How would they be unlocked?
YES, they're all automatically unlocked.  Please consider whether they will actually have an effect on your character (i.e., are they really worth the feat?)
