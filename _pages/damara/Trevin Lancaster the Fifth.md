Trevin Lancaster the Fifth is the fifth in a long line of Trevins.

Once greatly wealthy, the Lancaster family fortune has been greatly depleted, as Trevin has required resurrection many times.  This is to the great chagrin of his young (32) wife, and their marriage has suffered accordingly.  However, as a devout worshiper of Ilmater, Trevin believes his relationship with his wife gets him closer to his god.

Trevin is old, with a tendency to ramble, but he really does know an incredible amount about many obscure subjects.  As well, he can cast cure spells due to his close relationship with Ilmater.  He is technically a noble of the court, but has a tendency to doze off or simply fail to attend.  Trevin is obvioiusly henpecked, and carries a flask of wine, allegedly for use with the spell Identify, though he can be seen sneaking sips quite frequently.

In combat, most adversaries typically ignore him at first, due to his obvious frailty and lack of anything identifying him as a wizard - he dresses like a foppish old noble.  He'll usually be fairly useless as a combatant, but will cast protective spells and heal the wounded if necessary.  Out of combat, his divination specialty is useful.

Trevin claims, often, that he used to be a much more powerful wizard, and there is some evidence to support this, though it's unlikely that he was as powerful as he says.   He also has a Boccob's Blessed Book filled with spells somewhere, but his wife hid it on him out of spite.  He keeps his current spellbook far away from her, just in case.

He has a son, named Trevin Lancaster the Sixth, who goes by the nickname Vinnie.
