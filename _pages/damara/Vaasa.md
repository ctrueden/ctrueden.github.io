This untamed wasteland of frozen moors and tundra was the seat of power for the evil lich ((Zhengyi the Witch-King)) until his defeat by a band of adventurers.  Vaasa is once again a lonely land dotted with scratch farms and inhabited by evil humanoids and other monsters.  What the land lacks in hospitality it makes up for in untapped wealth, as the mountains of Vaasa are rich in metals and gems, particularly ((Bloodstone)).  Miles of mountainside go unclaimed by any civilization, and many well-armed prospectors make the trip to Vaasa hoping to find gems as large as a grown man's fist - and survive long enough to sell them.
