-=Wiki FAQ=-

Here are some common technical questions about the Damara wiki.

__Q:__ How do I make a wiki character sheet for my character?

__A:__ You can copy the ((Wiki Character Sheet Template|template found here)). See ((Ewan Dragonsbane)) and ((Mara)) for examples.

__Q:__ How do I make a Google spreadsheet for my character?

__A:__
#First, you need to [https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount|create a Google account], if you do not have one already.
#Once you have one and are logged in, click an existing character's Google spreadsheet link on the ((People)) page. I suggest choosing a character as similar to yours as possible, since the sheet will more closely resemble what you need.
#Click the File button and choose &quot;Copy spreadsheet...&quot; to make a copy in your own webspace.
#Change the cell values to match your character. Notice that most sheets have three tabs -- Main, Spells and Gear -- accessible from the bottom left corner of the sheet. You can insert or delete whatever cells you need to rearrange the sheet and make room for your character's details.
#Enable others to view your sheet by clicking the Collaborate tab in the upper right corner, and pressing the &quot;Allow anyone to view&quot; button. It should tell you that &quot;Anyone can view this document at:&quot; and show a link. Copy the link location and paste it into the table on the ((People)) page next to your character, and you're done!

__Q:__ How do I avoid losing my wiki edits if there is a problem (e.g., the database server goes down)?

__A:__ You could try the [http://lifehacker.com/software/greasemonkey/download-of-the-day-textarea-backup-greasemonkey-243944.php|textarea backup] script for Firefox's [https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748/|Greasemonkey] extension, which automatically saves your text every ten seconds. I haven't tested it with the wiki, but I would be surprised if it doesn't work. Also, if you making a major edit, you could compose your changes in a separate text editor, then paste into the edit box when finished.

__Q:__ How do I make an anchor in the middle of a wiki page, and link to it from somewhere else?

__A:__
*You can use the ANAME and ALINK commands as described [http://tikiwiki.org/PluginAnchors|here].
*Using !, !! and !!! to make section headings automatically creates a corresponding page anchor.
*ALINK only works to link to an anchor on the same page. To link to an anchor on a different page, use [tiki-index.php?page=Civics#Chapter_2_Enemies_of_the_State|something like this].

__Q:__ Where can I learn more about the wiki syntax, such as how to use strikethrough?

__A:__ See [http://doc.tikiwiki.org/tiki-index.php?page_ref_id=268|this page], which includes an explanation of [http://doc.tikiwiki.org/tiki-index.php?page_ref_id=268#Strike_through_text|how to do strikethrough].
