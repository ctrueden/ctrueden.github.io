!!Chapter Wrap-Up Session

The final week of each chapter is a collaborative GM session with three goals:
#Review the past chapter's events
#Handle that chapter's ((Civics))
#Plan the next chapter's story

!!Chapter review and civic actions

Having a wrap-up each chapter eliminates the need for a complicated civic management system, instead favoring freeform storytelling. Those present at the wrap-up decide what the city does with its resources that chapter, and how the consequences (rewards or otherwise) of each mission affect the state of the nation. These decisions are recorded on the ((Civics)) page.

The statistics of Damara only update once per chapter, during the wrap-up. Unlocks also do not become available until the end of the chapter, so that GMs have at least two weeks to study what has been unlocked and adjust their missions accordingly.

If you do not attend the wrap-up, you can still participate by explaining what your story characters are working on, either by emailing the mailing list, or by telling someone else directly.

!!Planning the next chapter

Because each chapter's storyline is planned at the previous chapter's wrap-up session, all story missions are posted at the beginning of the chapter. A chapter ends when all story missions have been completed, though players may agree to extend the chapter by a week or so if desired.

If you want to be surprised by the story in the coming chapter, you can elect not to participate in the planning portion of the wrap-up -- you will not have much input into the upcoming story, but you also will not be spoiled to possible story events. Alternatively, you can choose to leave the room if someone starts detailing a story mission idea that interests you as a player. It is also possible to GM a story mission designed by someone else, although obviously volunteering to do so would spoil you to that particular mission.

See ((Story Ideas)) for a brief list of possible missions and plots for upcoming chapters.

!!Other notes about wrap-up

At the end of a chapter, each character can be edited within reason.  No need for the PHB2 rebuilding/retraining rules.  Stick to the character concept, though.
