This page will provide private details of Alex's character, for Alex and the GMs only.


# The concept

The idea is the daughter of Erica Banyon and ~~#FF0000:the eighteenth grandson~~ of Sara Cassenti. Seriously concerned about the prejudice against mystics on Earth, Erica and her lover traveled to one of the newly settled colonies as far from Earth as possible. Then they took a shuttle to a nearby scientific outpost, which had not been seeded with mystic energy, since it was on a small asteroid. There, Erica raised her daughter for 18 years, until her father grew too sickly (from being away from mystic energy for too long). They then returned to the colony, where the daughter attended the local university and earned her degree. By the time she was 25, she was fully grown by human standards (half-elves reach maturity at 25), working in whatever field she works in.

She has learned to mask the use of her warded mystic magic. Other mystics can still sense when she uses it, and the mystic detection devices can still sense her while she is actually using the magic, but she has discovered a way to protect a warded effect so that it can go undetected otherwise. She uses this technique to conceal her half-elven, half-celestial nature. [[Curtis: half-elven, half-celestial? You'd better give this character a high Cha, Alex. (:mrgreen:)]

Alex, if you could fill in more details, particularly the exact timeline of Erica's life that we talked about, that would be great. Erica can either never age at all, or age very slowly (whatever you think makes more sense). Note that as we discussed, elves lose one point of Con every two Earth years away from magic. So if the father had a 12 Con and stayed away 18 years as mentioned, his Con would have dropped to 3.

-------- 

Raised in a mystic-free [space settlement](http://members.aol.com/oscarcombs/spacsetl.htm) in the [Lalande 21185](http://www.solstation.com/stars/la21185.htm) system, and schooled on [Percepi](Worlds). After finishing her graduate studies in genetics Ariona decided to travel to the world of her conception to &quot;see the sights,&quot; as it were.  As of game start, she has been on Earth for about a month. 

Somewhat quiet, though quite attractive; rather bookish and naive; a reasonable musician, though not even close to her mother's abilities; extremely intelligent and quick-witted.  Ariona has a sense of humor, but her sheltered life (and slower development) makes her sometimes appear to be far less sophisticated than her age peers.  She also seems to possess an aura of sanctity, of a purity unmatched by any but the most holy of men; she appears to be completely unaware of this effect on those around her. 
~~#FF0000:''A general description of appearance and mannerisms.''~~

Lived on small outpost until finished high school; father was very ill by this point (from lack of mystic energy), so family moved to new colony for his recovery and my schooling.  After a couple of years, became clear that this wasn't enough, and parents left when I was 21.  Mother visited me often (I &quot;lived alone,&quot; but with enough space for them to nearly split their time), but when I finished my master's I decided I wanted to come to Earth to live on the world of my origins.  I have VERY recently come to this planet when the game starts. 
''~~#FF0000:Basically the same stuff Curtis said, with an extra date or two.  I just copied and pasted from my notes for the character; I didn't write anything new yet.  Once I meet with you (Curtis) again, I can add anything else you want.~~''

''~~#FF0000:__Let me know when I can actually do my character creation; it's basically done except for the &quot;Merits and Flaws&quot;ish-type things. :)__~~

# Character Questionnaire 

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
#Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?  ~~#C00080:2~~ 
#Help a frail old woman cross the street?  ~~#C00080:5~~ 
#Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?  ~~#C00080:5 -- But only my parents; they wouldn't be likely to judge. :)~~
#Give money to a beggar on the street?  ~~#C00080:4 -- If they looked like they honestly needed it, I could afford to give them something.~~
#Seek vengeance if wronged?  ~~#C00080:1.5 -- It'd have to be a pretty awful thing for me to even consider vengeance.~~ 
#Steal if he thought he could get away with it? ~~#C00080:1 -- Besides it being wrong, why steal when if I REALLY wanted something I could ask Mom for it? :P~~

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
#Aliens?  ~~#C00080:5~~ 
#Karma?  ~~#C00080:3 -- I'd like to. . . .~~ 
#Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?  ~~#C00080:4~~ 
#Time travel?  ~~#C00080:5~~ 
#Equality for all sentient beings?  ~~#C00080:5 -- It's something that's very important to me; I believe that anything that exhibits true sentience should be allowed to become master of its own fate.~~ 
#God or other supreme force? ~~#C00080:3 -- I KNOW Gaia and Emmanuel existed and formed the Caretaker, but I'm not certain about their qualifications as &quot;supreme force&quot; or godliness in the Christian sense.  I assume there are probably other beings out there with similar powers to them.~~ 

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
#Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.  ~~#C00080:1 -- Intelligence isn't everything.  Machines still don't have the same &quot;creative spark&quot; or something.  Besides, there's beauty in all life.  A completely mechanical existence would lose the joy of diversity.~~ 
#The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.  ~~#C00080:3 -- Well, I've got mixed feelings on this.  It'd be nice if the Caretaker would only meddle with those who want meddling, but sometimes it's for the best in the long run.  (After all, I wouldn't be here without the events that led up to the Caretaker's creation, and no one much at the time thought the meddling was for the best. :P)  I'd be a real hypocrite if I said, &quot;No, the Caretaker should stay out of our lives,&quot; considering what I am and what my parents are, but I also feel that people should be left to make their own mistakes as much as possible.~~ 
#Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.  ~~#C00080:2 -- Woah, woah.  All TERRANS?  Screw you, hippie. :P  All sentient beings?  That I could agree with more, at least in principle.  But who decides what's best for all?  Saving a thousand lives by averting a spaceship crash?  Sure.  Of course a mystic in the right place at the right time (with sufficient power!) should do that.  But sacrificing one's own life to 'port a brillant scientist or the President to safety instead of yourself or your family?  Well . . . most people would say the &quot;important person&quot; would be more to the benefit of society, but I think decisions like that have to be left up to the individual.  It's the fear of society mandating what mystics are and aren't allowed to do that drove my parents away from Earth in the first place.  Mystics are people, with the right to live the lives of their choosing, just like any other.  I think any &quot;good&quot; person would try to use their talents to make the world better than they left it in SOME way, regardless of whether they have mystic potential or not.  How they choose to do that is their business, and no one else's.~~ 
#No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.  ~~#C00080:2 -- It would depend on the machine, I guess, how much I agree with that.  I haven't personally known well any robots who claim sentience, but if they are self-aware and have a desire to continue their existence, they should be given that freedom.~~ 
#Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications.  ~~#C00080:4 -- It might have been better to wait until it was better understood, but it also has had many benefits.  Ideally, it should have been done on a smaller scale first, but what's done is done and can't be changed at this late date.~~ 
#Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day.  ~~#C00080:5 -- Mystic energy is limited by our capacity to wield it.  Yes, groups of people can combine to make things more powerful, but the threshold tends to be lower than technology.  Any nut can get his hands on tech that could blow up a much larger area than the average 5000 people could do with mystic energy.  I think it's a lot less likely that enough mystics will get together and destroy the world than that a lot of power-mad &quot;normal&quot; people would do the same with WMDs.~~ 

# Some Notes on Names 

My full name is Ariona Lenmana Cassyon.  &quot;Ariona&quot; is a combination of &quot;Arion&quot; (&quot;musician&quot;), and &quot;Ariana&quot; (&quot;very holy one&quot;).  &quot;Lenmana&quot; means &quot;flute girl,&quot; and &quot;Len&quot; means &quot;flute&quot; while &quot;Mana&quot; means psychic gifts.  &quot;Cassyon,&quot; of course, is a hybrid of Banyon and Cassenti. 

My father's real name is Thalevar Starsong; my mother, of course, is Erica Banyon.  When they left for the remote outpost, they acquired new identification with the names Raphael and Basilie Cassyon.  Any inquiries into my past will get those names for my parents, though an extremely astute researcher would see that their history before their arrival on the outpost is not quite perfectly forged. ;) 

The name of the jealous ex-friend of my father's, the one who has decided that my mother and I are at fault for taking him away from her, and for everything bad that has happened to him since, is Vondre' Willowtree.

# Mystic Researcher

The Mystic Researcher devotes her time to the exploration of different ways in which mystic energy can be harnessed.  In particular, the Mystic Researcher is fascinated by the dichotomy of the Mystic vs. the Psychic, and the fact that the underlying energies appear to be the same, though the sources are vastly different.  A Mystic Researcher spends her time in pursuit of greater understanding of the "particles" (detected by most machines which identify those with mystic ability) which are apparently responsible for the effects commonly known as "magic."  A reclusive scholar, a well-respected scientist with a hidden bent to his work, or an adventurous magician could all easily evolve into Mystic Researchers. 

Mystic Researchers tend to be somewhat reclusive, preferring to pursue their studies away from the prying eyes of those who would attempt to use such knowledge for their own ends.  They typically realize how dangerous their new-found talents could be, and are unlikely to allow such secrets to get out.  After all, they study magic for their own edification, not to turn it into weapons. 

Select this advanced class if you want your character to excel at magical research, with the ability to manipulate her own energy fields to create unusual and stunning effects, at the expense of more physical abilities. 

The fastest path into this advanced class is from the Smart hero basic class, though other paths are possible. 

### Requirements 
To qualify to become a Mystic Researcher, a character must fulfill the following criteria. 
__Skills:__  6 ranks in Research, plus 6 ranks in Mysticraft. 
__Feat:__  Mystic Dampening 
__Other:__  Ability to cast mystic magic 


### Class Information 
The following information pertains to the Mystic Researcher advanced class. 

__Hit Die__ 
The Mystic Researcher gains 1d6 hit points per level.  The character's constitution modifier applies. 

__Action Points__ 
The Mystic Researcher gains a number of action points equal to 6 + one-half his character level, rounded down, every time he attains a new level in this class. 

__Class Skills__ 
The Mystic Researcher's class skills are as follows. 
Computer Use (Int), Craft (alchemy, chemical, pharmaceutical, visual art, writing) (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Knowledge (arcane lore, art, behavioral sciences, business, civics, current events, earth and life sciences, history, physical sciences, popular culture, streetwise, tactics, technology, theology and philosophy) (Int), Mysticraft (Int), Profession (Wis), Read/Write Language (none), Research (Int), Search (Int), and Speak Language (none).

The Mystic Researcher receives (7 + Int) skill points per level.


### Class Features 
The following features pertain to the Mystic Researcher advanced class. 

__Cannibalize:__ The Mystic Researcher becomes more attuned to the ebb and flow of the mystic energy within herself, allowing her to redistribute some of her warding and dampening energy onto new effects. Once per day per Mystic Researcher level, the character may &quot;cannibalize&quot; one of her warded effects (partially or completely), sucking the Reserve points back into herself for reuse that same round. The cannibalization is a free action which takes place on the turn during which she intends to create a new effect, and the Reserve points may only be spent on warding or dampening the new effect. More reserve points may be used in addition to those cannibalized, but any points above and beyond those required for the new effect are lost. 

__Bonus Feat:__ At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, the Mystic Researcher gets a bonus feat.  The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Mystic Researcher must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it. 
''Alertness, Attentive, Craft Mystic Item, Educated, Efficient Burst, Empower Sphere, Extra Reserve, Far Reach, Great Fortitude, Imbue Mystic Energy, Improved Mystic Charge, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Low Profile, Meticulous, Mystic Charge, Overdraw, Overdraw Focus, Skill Focus (class skill), Steadfast Effect, Studious, Temporal Extension.''

__Aura Detection:__ The character is so attuned to the auras given off by (non-dampened) effects by 3rd level that she begins to see them even when she did not create them. Without the use of an active divination effect, the character has a chance to notice a non-dampened warded effect. The difficulty of the Mysticraft check to detect the aura is equal to (30 minus half the sphere total of the effect). If the effect is concealed (such as behind a wall), the difficulty is increased by 10 per foot of material (subject to GM adjustment depending on the type of material -- lead is more difficult, and iron is impossible).
If the aura is successfully detected, the Mystic Researcher is aware that an aura is present, but must still use a Divination effect to determine more information.

__Improved Dampening:__ At 4th level, the Mystic Researcher's ability to dampen passive magics reaches a breakthrough, and she is able to extend her knowledge to effects as they are being created (including those which are charged, if she possesses such knowledge). At the time an effect is created, if she uses an amount of reserve equal to twice the total sphere level involved in the effect, she may create it &quot;dampened.&quot; This procedure is not as undetectable as a dampened warded effect; anyone in the area when the effect happens is allowed a Mysticraft check to detect that the Mystic Researcher is the source of the effect. The difficulty of the check is (30 plus Mystic Researcher level minus one half sphere total of the effect), as it is harder to hide the particles inherent in the more powerful magics.
If the Mystic Researcher is not detected as the source, the effect is not recognizable as mystic in origin unless the observer is using a Divination effect. Those using a Divination effect, however, recognize the Mystic Researcher as the source as though it were not dampened.

__Mystic Surge:__ At 6th level, with the expenditure of an action point, the Mystic Researcher may immediately gain a partial action for the sole purpose of creating a mystic effect. However, pushing herself in this way is a strain, and the effect costs twice as much as usual in all relevant spheres (she must pay for the effect twice). If the Mystic Researcher succeeds in a Mysticraft check to identify an effect as it is being created, she may use this ability to interrupt that effect, such that hers happens first. The action granted by this ability may be used to ready an immediate counterspell, if desired.

__Strengthen Warding:__ Though normally a warded effect cannot have its warding strengthened without the entire effect being recreated, a Mystic Researcher learns to weave together the mystic particles in new ways. Provided she created the original effect, a Mystic Researcher of 7th level or higher is able to add Reserve points to the warded effect. She must expend two reserve points to effectively boost the warding by one level. Thus, if an effect is due to collapse 1d6 hours from the original casting, the Mystic Researcher may use 4 Reserve points to improve the effect's duration to permanent.

__Internal Energies:__ As the Mystic Researcher continues her study of the particles of magic, she begins to truly understand the way the energies flow around a psion. Starting at 9th level, if she is ever cut off from her source of mystic energy while conscious and aware, she may begin concentrating as a move-equivalent action each round to begin storing a small amount of mystic energy within herself. As long as she continues to concentrate in this fashion, she retains access to a number of mystic sphere points (normal spheres and/or Reserve) equal to her Mystic Researcher level. Her sphere of influence is as normal, but because the space in her immediate vicinity is outside that sphere of influence, certain effects may not function intuitively. The Mystic Researcher always counts as being within her own sphere of influence (e.g., she can ward effects on herself, but not others).

__Natural Dampening:__ Upon completing this class, the Mystic Researcher's understanding of the nature of energy dampening is so advanced that all effects she creates are automatically dampened. Warded effects are now also automatically dampened at no additional cost. The DC to detect a dampened effect as it is created is as given in the Improved Dampening ability.

# Alchemical Items in my possession 

__Silk Feathered Cloak__ 
''made from a Coatl feather, Siren's hair, and a Swanmee feather''

|Cha Bonus|Ability|

__Wand of Tenebrous Incandescence__
''made from one of Cain's hairs, one of Ariona's, and one of Basilie's''
The hairs, when bound together, inexplicably grew into a thin, perfectly smooth cylinder about six inches in length, with the color of smoky ivory and the feel of cold granite.

At will, the wand can manifest light and darkness. Light generated from the wand is pale and otherworldly, and feels uncomfortably sterile. Darkness emanating from the wand feels smothering, and you imagine it more difficult to breathe while inside.

When desired, you may channel raw mystic energy into the wand, up to your normal limit per round. Channeling magic into the wand adds it to the wand's pool of magic.

When readying a counterspell, on a successful mysticraft check, magic from the wand's pool can be used directly instead of paying from personal resources. As an option, instead of countering, the mystic may opt to allow the spell to complete, but inflict backlash upon the one creating the effect.

Lastly, as a standard action, an amount of reserve equal to your mystic level can be drawn from the pool. But any such magic is tainted with backlash.

__Chain Link of Binding__ 

This causes the bearer to be bound to Nikolai.  If bearer is ever lost in the Void, Nikolai can find them, and he can use the link to transport himself to their location at any time, so long asthey do not resist.
