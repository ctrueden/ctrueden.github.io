### The concept

A young dragon who has chosen to leave her home planet when she learned that Dragonstar would be passing by a nearby world with mystic energy. According to the scholars, this planet was first encountered around 275 years ago (last time Dragonstar was in the vicinity), and no other planet encountered by the dragons has shared that quality with their world before. Though it could mean being left behind--or maybe even devoured by the dragons' ancient nemesis--she decides to travel to Earth anyway.


###  Rekari Der'Ken life story

This is a rough draft outline of Rekari Der'Ken's (or Rae Denison as her human disguise) life so far. This will be filled out with more names, details etc. in the next few days:

Rekari Der'ken, young white dragon, 21 winters old at present
born on Garn's Tooth mountain in the IceHome mountain range in the Southern Hemisphere of Glaurung
Daughter of Yeni Der'ken (and unknown father)
Moved to the lower west slopes of the mountain when her mother kicked her out at 8 winters old
(bored as hell with her &quot;people&quot; by age 11)

Met Morijin Illindra, brass adult, on the hills below the mountain in her 14th winter 
moved to New StarShine in the Ven Valley below the mountain in the spring after her 14th winter

New StarShine is a city of about 300,000 dragons in the semi-arid Ven Valley. It is 60% brass but many other colors are represented (15% gold is the largest minority group). It is slightly isolated but known for its world famous Andernian Museums and the New Starshine Institute for the Psyonically Gifted (teaches young dragons aged 10 through 75 advanced psyonic arts). Though the city sprawls out into the valley many of the buildings (especially downtown) are very tall, allowing the wealthy to live at higher altitudes where the mountains block out the sun for less of the day.

Rekari lives with Morijin and his wife Ange (also brass) in the suburbs 
Ange is barren and they eventually treat Rekari much like their own child

Morijin enrolls her in the Institute, where Morijin teaches advanced classes (~50 year old students)
Rekari is initially placed in a class of 10 year old dragons, and struggles with her studies and the culture of the place (as well as the heat of the city)
The second year she is moved to the class of 12 year olds (where some bullying and nastiness ensues)
By here third year she is moved to a class of 16 year olds (two years behind her own age)
In her fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh year she is only advanced with the same cohort
I her fifth year she begins to be frustrated with the &quot;slow&quot; pace that she is allowed to advance and the way that the other students still treat her as an outsider, she begins to put in minimal effort in her classes and explore some of the darker side of the city to keep herself amused

Near the beginning of 7th year of school an exhibit of relic space crafts comes to the Andernian Museum of History and the news begins reporting about the new star system that astronomers have discovered that Glaurung will be passing near (folks get crazy because there is some evidence that there may be a sentient magic using race in the star system, with more evidence each week that Glaurung gets nearer).

Rekari begins having nightmares every night about being chased through dark, bone chillingly cold tunnels by a creature that breathes pure terror at her heels two days after she is caught stealing from one of the students at the institute and is suspended for a month (and has a major falling out with Morijin).
Angry and hurt she leaves Morijin's home and spends most of her days hanging out with &quot;acquaintances&quot; from New Starshine's underworld. She is miserable and the nightmares continue. 

She visits the Andernian Museum of History and is intrigued by an ancient teleportation device that is on display as well as the recent evidence that the sentient race in the Sol system may posses space travel. She convinces one of her acquaintances to help her steal the device and get it operation by paying him her entire savings.

She trys to tell Morijin and Ange that she is going to try to find out what really is out there in the near by solar system. She is trying to do what she can to do the &quot;right&quot; thing but only provokes a screaming fight where Morijin forbids her to leave Glaurung (to her &quot;certain death&quot;). Rekari tells him that he and his &quot;damned elitist Institute can rot in hell&quot; and leaves for the last time. (Morijin doesn't really believe that she can get off of Glaurung, but he is upset by the thought that she wants to throw away her life and worried about her.)

Rekari and her acquaintance succeed in breaking into the museum and getting a teleporter working, Rekari teleports to the third planet of the Sol system (which the astronomers are currently saying is the most likely to be the home world of a sentient species). 
She initially is teleported to the far north part of Earth and skirts one of the larger cities in the north (using her powers to be invisible) learning more about the self named &quot;humans&quot;

Rekari's nighmares become less frequent (once a week or so) as she is busy learning about the human world

She has recently (the last three months) taken a disguise as a human woman (illusory) in order to learn more about their society (she gives the name Rae Denison)
she fakes caustrophobia and haphephobia (fear of being touched by sentient creatures) to keep others from discovering her disguise


### Character Questionnaire answers

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):

;1. Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?:3 (Eh... sometimes it's right to tell the truth, sometimes its too much trouble)
;2. Help a frail old woman cross the street?:2 (I suppose if she was dying or something, but she really shouldn't be trying to cross the streets in a state like that. She should just go lie in a hospital and die at that point.)
;3. Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?:3 (I tried to tell Morijin what I thought might be out there, but that turned out just splendid didn't it?)
;4. Give money to a beggar on the street?:2 (If they are so weak and stupid to end up like that then what's the point? Perhaps if I thought they could be rehabilitated easily or had great potental I'd bother.)
;5. Seek vengeance if wronged?:4 (No one truly regrets until they feel the pain they've caused you.)
;6. Steal if he thought he could get away with it?:4 (Eh... if I need it and it won't cause too much fuss, why not?)

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):

;1. Aliens?:5 (well I've been observing them for almost 9 months now...)
;2. Karma?:2 (hopefully such a thing doesn't exits, I doubt it does...)
;3. Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?:5 (and what in the frozen wastes of IceHome would be the point in not believing that?)
;4. Time travel?:2 (*wing shrug* Eh... could be, but I doubt it.)
;5. Equality for all sentient beings?:2 (I can say from experience that some back mountains idiots don't deserve to be considered equal. Individuals should get a chance to prove they are mentally my equals though.)
;6. God or other supreme force? :3 (I've heard the theory that Glaurung was sent by some supreme force to save us long ago, or that the heart of Glaurung is that force, but all that could be a load of crap.)

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):

;1. Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.:1 (So far I haven't seen a machine do anything that my people couldn't manage with a bit of magic.)
;2. The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.:3 (Whatever. If it's real and it's meddling I don't think this distinction matters very much.)
;3. Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.:1 (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... not even all dragons believe that kind of sentimental crap.)
;4. No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.:3 (For all I know some machines could be sentient. Frankly if they behave like thinking  creatures I don't see why it matters if they really are.)
;5. Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications.:5 (No shit. For all I know that could have been what got the Beast after us in the first place, if it was ever real. Humans have started mucking about with magic with only the barest idea of what it's capable of and they still rely too heavily on their planet's stores of magic for their spells. Frankly I think the lack of magic during the formative years of their culture may have damaged them substantially. Their rabid fear of mortality isn't helping either as far as I can tell.)
;6. Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day. :3 (Maybe. I don't know if humans are going to come into some sort of balance between science and magic with out an external fear to pin them down. They're very clever but they seem to be tripping all over themselves trying to move &quot;forward&quot; with out thinking what &quot;forward&quot; really means for their fragile lives.)


### Dragon society

The dragons--all metallic and chromatic flavors--hail from a massive world known as Dragonstar. The planet's gravity is twice as powerful as Earth's, as is its mystic energy, meaning that mystic effects there are twice as strong as they would be on Earth. Dragonstar is unique in that it does not orbit a star, but travels throughout the galaxy. The planet itself is alive, called Glaurung by the dragons, and revered by them. Legend says that long, long ago, the dragons lived in paradise. But then the Ancient Wyrm with seven heads--whom the dragons call the Beast--came to devour them. The dragons were rescued by Glaurung, who arrived to carry them to safety.

They have been wandering the universe ever since. The elders tell the younglings that should Glaurung ever rest for more than a short time, the Beast will find them and destroy them. Indeed, it has been observed that whenever Dragonstar comes to a stop, strange, psionic echoes become audible after a while, growing increasingly louder as time passes, carrying horrific waves of terror and nausea with them. It is also taboo to leave Dragonstar, although a small number of spaceships exist for emergencies. The stories say that those who leave the planet without permission will be left behind, never to set foot on Dragonstar again. Many even go so far as to say that such fools are devoured by the Beast.

Dragons live a very long time by human standards (over 1,000 years), but do eventually die. When that happens, dragon lore says that the dragon's spirit returns to the ancient paradise to exist peacefully with the other transcendent dragons.

Lastly, dragons possess the secrets of [psionic power](MagicPsionics), meaning that not only can dragons draw on Dragonstar's mystic energy to perform magic, they can also train their minds to draw from within.
