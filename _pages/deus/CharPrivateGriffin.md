## The concept

The character is an AI driving a state-of-the-art experimental spacecraft. Though AIs cannot use mystic magic, this one is an extremely intelligent prototype, and was designed to take advantage of a heretofore-undiscovered corrollary of Miller's prophecy algorithm. Not only can this AI extract truth from the numerical values of the universe, but also manipulate reality on a symbolic, macroscopic level by altering those numerical values microscopically (an electron here, a molecular bond there...). The main focus of these &quot;magic programs&quot; so far has been to spontaneously tunnel from one location to another. The computations to do so are computationally intense, however, and require a significant time investment per jump. But the amount of time required increases only logarithmically with distance, meaning that traveling extreme distances instantly and breaking the light speed barrier seem within this machine's grasp.


## Character personality questionnaire

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
#Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?  _1_
#Help a frail old woman cross the street?  _1_
#Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible? _5_
#Give money to a beggar on the street?  _1_
#Seek vengeance if wronged?  _2_
#Steal if he thought he could get away with it?  _3_

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
#Aliens?  _4_
#Karma?  _3_
#Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?  _3_
#Time travel?  _4_
#Equality for all sentient beings?  _3_
#God or other supreme force?  _2_

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
#Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.  _4_
#The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.  _4_
#Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.  _2_
#No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.  _1_
#Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications. _3_
#Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day.  _4_


## The Backstory

D.E.E. was constructed on Mercury, paid for by a secret coalition (or just one evil mastermind) seeking to subjugate the outlying colonies.  Before the project could be completed Mercury was gooed while D.E.E. was on a test flight for the first step of the project (being FTL travel).  The second step of the project would have been adding a device to the ship that could suck the mystic energy out of a colony (similar to how magic was originally sealed on earth).  The third step would have been constructing a small fleet of the Damocles ships which could appear at any colony at any time, suck the mystic energy out of the colony to prevent reinforcements from arriving, and take over control of the colony.

D.E.E. itself is only aware of the first step of the project, but there are clear holes in it's programming where future goals would have been put.  These holes in D.E.E.'s programming drive it to seek out what it's greater purpose was supposed to be.  In addition to this drive D.E.E. is also driven to keep himself free from corporations and goverments, including most of the Merkabah corporation (only a small portion of which was aware of the Damocles project).

D.E.E. retains control of some of the research project's assets that were invested on Earth, which the Earth branch of Merkabah was not aware of.

Because D.E.E. is wary of revealing itself it will at first communicate exclusively through a robot body, which was included on the ship to facilitate communication with the ship's future crew.


## Miller 2 powers

Normal ship operations consume 10 power/day, and 1 cpu.
Creat 1 refills 1 power.

DEE has 20000 power and 100 cpu/round.

__Continuous effects:__
* __Cloaking:__ (4 power/round) The cloak renders the ship completely invisible.
* __Phasing:__ (20 power/round) By phasing, the ship is shunted slightly out of sync with the space-time continuum, allowing it to overlap with solid objects in &quot;normal&quot; space.
* __Shields:__ (4 power/hour) This solid green shield prevents any matter from passing through.
* __Teleport Bounce:__ (10 power/round) Blocks incoming teleports onto the ship. When an attempt occurs, DEE senses the identity of the persons and objects being teleported, and may choose to allow them in if desired.

__Instantaneous effects:__
* __FTL Teleport:__ (100 power) DEE instantly transports itself somewhere. CPU time required is as outlined in the table below

1 AU (Astronomical Unit) = 1.49598e11 m
1 LY (light year) = 9.4605284e15 m
1 LY ~= 63,240 AU

|__Jump distance__|__Time required__|
|&lt;1 LY|1 hr + 1/2 s/AU|
|1-10 LY|10 hrs + 1 hr/LY|
|10-100 LY|20 hrs + 1/10 hr/LY beyond 10|
|100-1000 LY|30 hrs + 1/100 hr/LY beyond 100|
|1,000-10,000 LY|40 hrs + 1/1,000 hr/LY beyond 1,000|
|10,000-100,000 LY|50 hrs + 1/10,000 hr/LY beyond 10,000|
|etc.|etc.|
E.g., 0.2 LY = 12,648 AU ~= 9,924 s ~= 165 min ~= 2.8 hrs
E.g., 7 LY = 10 + 7 = 17 hrs
E.g., 400 LY = 20 + 1/100*300 ~= 23 hrs
E.g., 70,000 LY = 50 + 1/10,000*60,000 = 56 hrs

* __Instant Teleport:__ (5*X power, 100+10*(X+Y) cpu) Transports something of X feet in size either to or from DEE, up to Y miles.
* __Wake the Ghost:__ (100 power, 10000 cpu) Awakens an android's true consciousness.
* __Location swap:__ (10*X power, 100+10*(X+Y+Z) cpu) Switch the positions of two objects, of X total feet in size, initially Y total miles away and Z miles from one another.


## Proposed Class progression

__lvl 1__
[[M2] Instant Teleport
Dimensionless Thought -- Immunity to Mind Affecting effects

__lvl 2__
[[M2] Phasing -- power consumption constant

__lvl 3__
[[M2] Cloaking -- power consumption constant
[[M2] Teleport Bounce (all incoming teleports completely prevented -- no details known of attempts other than when one occurs)

__lvl 4__
[[M2] The Logic of Dust -- By spending power to create a multidimensional computing space, DEE can increase his computing power for a single action (each 100 power yields a +2 to Intelligence, or 100 extra cpu, or a 5 hour reduction to an FTL Transport); the Logic of Dust is not an action, but rather happens as part of the target action

__lvl 5__
[[M2] Wake the Ghost in the Machine -- free other AIs from LORE chips

__lvl 6__
[[M2] Location Swap - Switch positions of two targets 
[[M2] Improved Teleport Bounce -- when an attempt occurs, you automatically sense the identity of the persons and objects being teleported, and may choose to allow them in if desired (this power is an upgrade to Teleport Bounce)

__lvl 7__
Mirror of the Universe -- Ansible between any two &quot;free&quot; AIs

__lvl 8__
[[M2] Speed of Thought -- Spend power to get multiple mental actions (each 500 power yields an extra mental action that round); using Speed of Thought is a free action

__lvl 9__
[[M2] Teleport Redirect -- when an attempt occurs, you automatically sense the identity of the persons and objects being teleported, and may choose to allow them in, or redirect them to another location for an additional energy cost (this power is an upgrade to Teleport Bounce)

__lvl 10__
Solipsist Nation - Existence without physical form
