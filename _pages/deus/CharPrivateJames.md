* character name:  "Zee" (a name he pulls from fragmented flashbacks)
* family history and relations:  Fragmented memories.  Mom is a women with brown hair.  SHE WEARS TOO MUCH PERFUME.  She reads bedtime stories sitting in a wooden rocking chair in a room that smelled like flowers.  WHEN I GET ANGRY OR SAD THE FLOWERS DIE.  When she laughs she squeaks like a mouse.  SHE CRIED THE SAME WAY TOO.  She doesn't like candy.  SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW I GET IT OFF THE TOP SELF.  Dad is tall and jolly and loves to give shoulder rides.  HE THINKS THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME.  He's loosing his hair at the back of his head.  HE BLAMES ME FOR IT WHEN HE'S UPSET.  He lets me borrow the car and lies to Mom about how late I got home last night.  I STARTED IT WITHOUT KEYS THE FIRST TIME WE WENT DRIVING.  Mom and Dad stay in their room until late every Saturday morning or when they aren't working.  THEY MAKE TOO MUCH NOISE.  They love each other.  WHEN THEY FIGHT I GET SAD AND SOMETHING BREAKS IN AN EMPTY ROOM.  Someone else is always at the house.  HE SCARES ME.  He and Mom argue a lot and something about him makes her sad, but she cares about him.  I SEE HIS FACE IN MY NIGHTMARES.  He sleeps on a coat in the basement.  HE'S WATCHING ME.  Dad calls him "Sport."  HE'S LYING ABOUT WHO HE IS.  They have matching rings.  HE KNOWS I KNOW SOMETHING.  He sneaks me candy after dinner.  I FED IT TO THE DOG ONCE AND SHE GOT REALLY SICK.
* physical description:  Zee looks at most 18-20 years old.  He'd be slightly shy of six feet talk if he didn't hunch over so often.  He has messy, thin hair that's so light blond it's almost white.  He's probably natural clean-shaven, seeing how his hands shake so much shaving would be a catastrophe.  His eyes are light brown and very twitchy or completely empty.  He has a frequent nervous tick and a minor stuttering problem.  His sentences often trail into mumbo jumbo.  He's a bit sickly looking, like he's recovering from a bad fever.
* identifying characteristics:  His clothing is usually baggy, tattered or messy.  It's not uncommon for him to break into a nervous sweat.  There are odd scars on his head that are visible though his thinning hair. 
* personality:  Depends on the day.  Sometimes seems manic/depressive at best, schizophrenic at worst.  Other days he's nearly in a fugue state.  His demeanor is dynamic and unpredictable.
* religious views:  Completely inapplicable.
* daily habits:  As changing as his personality.  A week without bathing suddenly ends with him showering five times a day for three days straight.  One day will be spent staring at a wall and the next he's running around like a caffeinated hamster.  He constantly eats quickly, often forgoing  utensils and using his fingers.  He sleeps restlessly at night and often catnaps.
* quirks:  Full of them.  He has many nervous ticks and twitches, alternating from the attention span of a hyperactive six-year-old to the cryptic focus of an ancient sage and everything in between.
* likes &amp; dislikes:  Extremely bright lights and total darkness make him anywhere from nervous to hysterical.  He doesn't like large crowds but seems most calm in group settings.  He loves music.
* occupation:  Running, running from... something.  He doesn't know.
* schooling:  There's strong evidence to suggest that he's had at least a high school education.
* job satisfaction:  Not applicable.
* hobbies:  None really at campaign's beginning.
* friends:  None really at campaign's beginning.
* enemies:  Someone or multiple someones, likely who ever decided he was a danger or a lab animal.  Maybe one group wants to keep him from another group.  All he knows is that he isn't safe.
* greatest achievement:  His excape, which you and I should discuse one on one, Curt.
* greatest failure or disappointment:  Nothing he can recall, yet.

## Character personality questionnaire

Answering the following specific questions will help you to flesh out your character. Please answer each one with a number between 1 and 5, inclusive. Feel free to provide additional comments if you think your answer to a particular question is misleading or needs further clarification. And remember: there is no requirement for your character to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; -- such choices are entirely up to you.

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):

1. Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?  1, in his current state.  He probably doesn't understand the concept of lying.
2. Help a frail old woman cross the street?  1, unless she asked, in which case 5.  Manners and charity aren't really something he understands
3. Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?  5.  What's impossible to a fractured mind?
4. Give money to a beggar on the street?  See question 2.
5. Seek vengeance if wronged?  Tricky.  Like a 2 at this point.
6. Steal if he thought he could get away with it?  It depends on what he was told to do.

Does your character believe in  (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):

1. Aliens? 3
2. Karma?  3
3. Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?  3
4. Time travel?  3
5. Equality for all sentient beings?  3
6. God or other supreme force?  3

Zee currently is a bit too shattered to have many solid convictions.

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):

1. Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.  3
2. The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.  3
3. Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.  3
4. No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.  3
5. Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications.  3
6. Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day.  3
