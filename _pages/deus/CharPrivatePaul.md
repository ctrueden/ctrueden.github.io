This page will provide private details of Paul's character, for Paul and the GMs only.

Quiz:
Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?
Probably not. It's a bad idea to lie to people who are not equipped to tell the difference between a lie and a truth.

Help a frail old woman cross the street?
Well, if she trusted the blind guy with the cane.

Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?
He'd tell someone if he saw ANYTHING.

Give money to a beggar on the street?
If he knew said beggar was there, yes.

Seek vengeance if wronged?
Doubtful. 

Steal if he thought he could get away with it?
No. It's hard enough to get by without committing a felony. And what kind of example would that be?

Aliens? Huh? Why not? He's never really thought about it.

Karma? If there's karma, he must've done something pretty lousy in a past life.

Free will (i.e., many possible futures)? Life is what you make of it.

Time travel? Not something he thinks about.

Equality for all sentient beings? YES! HELL YES!

God or other supreme force? Well, people talk about something called a &quot;Caretaker?&quot;

Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete. What an offensive concept. Now that people can see, is he obsolete?

The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs. Well, if there's a God, he wouldn't mind if there was the occasional divine intervention.

Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans. Obligated? No.

No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life. No. Not fair. If machine life is intelligent, why would we give it less rights, just because it's different?

Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications. Probably. They mess around with genetics without entirely understanding the results.

Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day. Uhh... maybe?
