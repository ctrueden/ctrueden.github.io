-=Ridge=-

Ridge is obviously some form of artificial life form. She has a light and intricate body, that is only humanoid in the basic sense of having limbs in the appropriate places attached to a torso. Detail is given only to the hands and face. The hands seem to move very quickly, and careful observer might notice that extra articulation has been added. Her face has expressive pewter eyes and a human mouth which is set in a constant smile. The body is smaller than most artificial bodies and seems oddly, yet elegantly designed.
