Matt Smith, on all outward appearances is an ordinary genetically engineered boy.  Just having finished his secondary education and now buried under a Mountain of Debt, which he has unwisely opted to cure by joining a private investigation firm.  Fortunately due to the nature of his body, he's rather well suited to the breaking and entering thing, so maybe he stands a snowballs chance in hell in climbing out of the black hole of debt that he's found himself in.

He stands at four inches shy of six feet, brown black hair and pale green eyes.  Has a very compact build with no excess body fat.  Usually his work clothing involves black spandex in some way or other.
