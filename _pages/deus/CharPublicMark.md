Trenton is an oddity in these times of high technology.  He grew up in the depths of the Rocky Mountains.  The nearest town was a days drive away.  The people out here were generally technophobes, trying to avoid such modern trapings like magic and computers.  However Trentons parents were not technophobes, and while they did home school him, he was still allowed to make a few friends on the web thru his chip.  He never really bonded well with people though, and as friendships sometimes do, they would drift appart.  With the completion of his GED(I assume they are still called that) he stayed at home and helped his parents, who are both teachers of pre-magitech era history and science.  Online of course.  Both of his parents are known to be anti-magic, and have attended rally's and such.  However beyond their students and a few police records from when they were younger, its not THAT well known.  Its fairly obvious that Trenton follows their way of thinking, however he doesn't seem to have the same fevor as his parents. With the disappearence of the colony their efforts became more vigorous.  Trenton decided to set out to see if he could find proof for himself whether or not magic is truly the benifit everyone sees it as.  

Trenton often wears tan khaki pants, black tennis shoes, a white undershirt with a solid color button up t-shirt.  Over that he wears his tan trench coat.  His hair is combed straight, and isn't in any flashy new age style.  Overall he would probably appear very ordinary, if it were still the 20th century.
