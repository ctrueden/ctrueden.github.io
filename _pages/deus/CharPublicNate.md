Max is about 6' tall, 160 - 170 lbs, and in his early twenties.  He has green eyes and glasses, a kind of rarity or at best archaic style these days, and black hair that is spiked up and back.  He is usually found wearing a black suit and tie with a white shirt, leather gloves, and the scent of fine cologne. He has sharp features and carries himself with an air of strong confidence.  If one looks closely they'll notice small marks of silver on his neck that he seems to be half-heartedly trying to keep hidden.
# Ned Solomon
Ned is an older Dwarf, maybe about 35 years in age.  He is covered in intericate and detailed tattoos composed of complex and nearly impossible knot-work and a number of norse battle scenes.  He seems more intelligent and socially apt then one would think at first glance, in some ways unnervingly so.
