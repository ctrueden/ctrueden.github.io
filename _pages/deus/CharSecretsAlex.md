DISAPPEARING COLONY

Ariona Cassyon -- Erica Banyon's daughter. Half celestial, half elven. The elf is a grandchild of Sara Cassenti--one of the children of the original two elves. He fell in love with Erica, and together they fled Earth, because they feared the hostility towards mystics that was building at the time. They chose an outpost near an outlying colony. This outpost is not mystically infused. They raise their daughter there for several years, but as time goes on, the father grows more and more sickly (since elves can't survive without mystic energy). Eventually, they are forced to return to the colony. Fortunately, it is in time for the daughter to attend college there. Her parents teach her to utilize her mystic powers to hide the fact that she is half-elven and half-celestial (because the parents are extremely paranoid about anyone finding out she's mystic -- they want no harm to come to her).

Ariona has the ability to hide the fact that mystic energies are warded around something (&quot;inverting the weave,&quot; to steal from Jordan). If I recall correctly, we ended up making this a mystic feat she has, that is not commonly known but could be taught to others.

It is Ariona's old colony that disappears. Both she and her parents have since moved back to Earth, but she probably still cares that it's gone.
