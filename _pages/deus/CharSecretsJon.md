JOSEF'S AWAKENING

Son of Boris and Anika (PDK). Naive, optimistic and friendly. Knows a little bit about mysticism, psionics, and necrophagic science. Is part void elemental, and part tainted undead (a small bit).

His uncle is Josef, pure evil. Josef might want to harness his &quot;void&quot; potential in some way, to destroy something. Alternately, maybe he could be useful in the elimination of the Destroyer force.

This character may be involved in some of the mystic genetics science as well, or the necrophagic activities surrounding Joey's character.
