There are no secrets for Harry.  Move along.

!!-Eddie
Eddie is a wormhole directly to the Caretaker.  This has some potentially major ramifications.

1. The Caretaker is currently trying to construct a way to make his mystic aura appear to come from another location.  Understanding how Eddie works may be *key* to making the Deus Ex Machina work.  He may have to be sacrificed to the caretaker in order to build it.

2. If he still is &quot;alive&quot; when the Machina kicks in, he may represent a chink in the armor provided by it.  The Destroyer, if it is capable of sensing mystic energy through Eddie, may come after him.  It might even be possible, if the Destroyer catches Eddie, for it to suck out the Caretaker through the wormhole.

3. If anything bad does happen to Eddie, this could have negative consequences for the Caretaker, as presumably, the wormhole goes both ways.  At the very least, the Caretaker would notice if and when Eddie got hurt, and this could raise suspicion about his existence.

4. While he's stayed out of fields where divination can take place, the main thing protecting the Caretaker from knowing he exists is that there hasn't been enough evidence to make anyone ask.  Still, the Miller algorithm may have indicated things about his existence.

Other than that, I was thinking about Eddie's vulnerability to light.  He needs to be able to operate at least seminormally in sunlight, as he was made to scout out planets in solar systems.  However, he'll still be confused by light-based weapons and other beams of light, and I will roleplay mild confusion in sunligbt or brighter ambient light.  He definitely prefers dark places.
