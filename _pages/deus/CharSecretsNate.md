SCIENTIST DISAPPEARANCE

A scientist who worked at a tech brokerage. Partially responsible for the conversion of Mercury into grey goo. Somehow escaped from the goo using something designed by Adam McLean called the Occultum Lapidem.

The Fearful may be interested in the grey goo's properties.

Zuul may have had a hand in the design of the grey goo bots. Otherwise, Nate's character's soul is being housed in the grey goo body in some *other* fashion than the way Zuul's son's &quot;protector&quot; is.

New idea from Max's first journal entry: maybe there is no Adam McLean--that is, maybe Max *is* Adam. If the only way he could deal with the guilt of having destroyed all those souls was to convince himself he was someone else--or if something went horribly wrong with all those souls floating around together--there is no guarantee that Max is who he thinks he is. Of course, the government has a record of Max and of Adam, so this bears further thought.
