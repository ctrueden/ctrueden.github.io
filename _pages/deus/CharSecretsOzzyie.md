This page will provide the GMs a restricted page to discuss secrets related to Ozzyie's character.

Oz's character is an astral deva named Malcolm Biggs.

The celestials are a society constructed within the Caretaker's mind. He uses the society as a means for grooming select chosen individuals from within it to be made physically real on the material plane. They are sent to promote harmony and foster peace throughout Earth, according to the Caretaker's will. The device used by Oz to communicate with the Caretaker/&quot;celestial plane&quot; uses a harmonic of the old Voice of God frequency.

Gaia is unable to create new souls since the incident with the [dragons](Dragons), and Emmanuel's alien nature does not allow him to reproduce the way we do in this dimension. Thus, by extension, the Caretaker cannot have children directly. So where does the Caretaker get the souls for use in creation of the celestial individuals? Why, from humans who have died, of course! So, Malcolm Biggs has the soul of someone currently deceased. But who? Someone from Pax? Matt Jones is probably too easy. Whatever we decide, he can start having visions of his previous life, especially if whatever is happening in game is related to the events of his past life somehow.
