Here are some possibilities for character concepts:

__Human:__ unless they get disallowed during the ban phase... j/k (:smile:)

__Dwarf:__ like the D&amp;D race; distrustful of magic but tolerant of technology; they are the keepers of the secrets of the spellbreakers

__Gnome:__ like the D&amp;D race; lovers of both magic and technology

__Royal:__ a new race that lives underground with the dwarves and gnomes; taller and thinner than humans, with blue skin and strange eyes; they are scientists working toward the betterment of all sentients through a combination of technology and mystic energy

__Halfling:__ like the D&amp;D race, except that they disappear when they leave Earth's atmosphere, making extraplanetary travel impossible for them

__Elf:__ since they were recently reborn, only a handful exist, and their existence is a closely guarded secret

__Gaian:__ many strange creatures exist, such as pixies, dryads, doppelgangers, trolls, beholders and giants; many (but not all) of these creatures worship Gaia or an entity known as the Caretaker (said to be an amalgamation of Gaia and an extradimensional entity known as Emmanuel); if it's a popular creature from Savage Species or the Monster Manual, chances are they exist

__Crossbreed:__ something part one race and part another

__Unique:__ something original, genetically engineered and grown in a laboratory

__Cybernetic:__ a being that is biological in nature as described above, but with cybernetic enhancements

__Soulmech:__ a sentient whose soul has been transferred into a robotic body; a mystic thus transferred retains magical abilities; these can appear as anything from quite inhuman to nearly indistinguishable from biological life

__Android:__ a human-like robot running a sophisticated artificial intelligence program; they do not have souls but are superintelligent, and are capable of taking full advantage of the Miller prophecy algorithm, netting them precognitive abilities; these can appear as anything from quite inhuman to nearly indistinguishable from biological life; androids are often completely mechanical, but sometimes have biological components embedded or integrated somehow (e.g., General Grievous from Star Wars)

__Cyborg:__ a being that is part biological, part mechanical; they are usually mostly biological with machines embedded or grafted on (e.g., the Borg from Star Trek); note that most humans have at least a few mechanical components (such as a neural jack), meaning that almost everyone is a cyborg to some extent

__Robot:__ any other non-human machine with artificial intelligence (e.g., a flying car with AI, or an intelligent laser pistol); they have similar benefits and disadvantages to androids, except that their lack of similarity to humans makes it harder for them to fit in; performing certain tasks might also be difficult depending on the robot's form

__Alien:__ I will neither confirm nor deny the existence of extraterrestrials in the campaign; inquire if interested

__Mystic:__ anything with a soul (a sentient) can possess mystic abilities, drawing mystic power from his surroundings to perform magic; see the [page covering mystic magic and psionics](MagicPsionics) for more information

__Psionic:__ anything with a soul (a sentient) can possess psionic abilities, drawing mystic power from his own soul to perform magic; only a select few even know that psionics exists, and the art is a closely guarded secret; see the [page covering mystic magic and psionics](MagicPsionics) for more information

__Genetic engineering:__ genes can be manipulated greatly; it is usually expensive but there are a variety of reasons someone's genetic structure might have been &quot;improved&quot;

__Nanotechnology:__ nanobots exist and can infuse anything, biological or mechanical, allowing for all kinds of weirdness
