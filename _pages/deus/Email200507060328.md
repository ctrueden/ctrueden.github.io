<br>Subject: login info sent out

Hi again everyone,

Ok, I sent out everyone's login information. Please let me know if you
did not get an email containing your username and password for the
Deus Ultionis website.

Note that you can change your password (as well as a few other
settings) by choosing Preferences from the lefthand menu after logging
in.

Like I said before, please update your Player page's available
timeslots to help me organize the groups.

Also, if you have submitted a character concept to me, please check
your character's private page to ensure the information there is
accurate. If you have not yet submitted one, feel free to edit the
private page to add information once you've got an idea.

-Curtis
