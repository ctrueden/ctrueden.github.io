Subject: character concept deadlines

Hi everyone,

Less than two months remain before the start of the campaign. I am
planning on posting a beefed up timeline of events from 2003 through
2299 (including the events that led up to Pax Artificium, for those of
you who are new). I should have it posted by early next week at the
latest, and it should clarify any remaining questions about the
setting.

Thus, I am setting a deadline on character concepts for August 1st.
Full backstories, character profiles (answering some questions that I
will post to the site soon) and public descriptions will be required
by August 8th. Since there are so many people interested in the
campaign, those who do not meet these deadlines will lose priority to
those who do. You will not actually need to create a character
mechanically (i.e., a character sheet) until September 1st, and I will
schedule individual appointments with each of you for that.

So, to recap the important dates:

__August 1:__ character concept submitted
__August 8:__ detailed character backstory, profile and public description
written and posted
__September 1:__ character sheet finished (with GM interaction)
__September 3:__ first session of the campaign (Saturday group)

Lastly, it looks increasingly likely that Monday is the day that will
be chosen for the third group.

As always, let me know if you have any questions.

-Curtis
