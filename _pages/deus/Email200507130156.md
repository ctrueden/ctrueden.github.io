<br>Subject: updated timeline, merit system adjustments

Hi everyone,

I have updated the web site with a few things.

In the [Setting](Setting) section, I added &quot;[ancient history](AncientHistory)&quot;  and &quot;[timeline](Timeline),&quot;
which cover events from 6,000 BC all the way up to 2,299 CE. I beefed
up the information about WW3 and WW4, and lots of other stuff.

I also updated the [merit system](MeritSystem) a bit--in particular, I clarified a
few things on the merit system overview page, and corrected the
spell-like ability costs to be more reasonable.

Lastly, I updated the [PCs](PlayerCharacters) page with known character names, and the
[Players](Players) page with updated priorities.

More information about [modern technology](Technology) is coming later--probably
next week some time.

-Curtis
