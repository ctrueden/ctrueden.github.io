Subject: updated timeline, merit system adjustments

Hi everyone,

I have updated the web site with a few things.

In the ((Setting)) section, I added &quot;((AncientHistory|ancient history))&quot;  and &quot;((Timeline|timeline)),&quot;
which cover events from 6,000 BC all the way up to 2,299 CE. I beefed
up the information about WW3 and WW4, and lots of other stuff.

I also updated the ((MeritSystem|merit system)) a bit--in particular, I clarified a
few things on the merit system overview page, and corrected the
spell-like ability costs to be more reasonable.

Lastly, I updated the ((PlayerCharacters|PCs)) page with known character names, and the
((Players)) page with updated priorities.

More information about ((Technology|modern technology)) is coming later--probably
next week some time.

-Curtis
