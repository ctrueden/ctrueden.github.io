Subject: web site errors

Hi everyone,

Many of you have probably encountered occasional errors on the Deus
Ultionis site. I apologize for those, but it's just my web host's
mySQL server being flaky. Short of moving to a new web host, there's
little I can do. I suppose I can complain to them and see if they can
do something to fix it, but don't hold your breath.

Anyway, if you get a big red message stating &quot;TikiWiki is not set up
properly!&quot; or something similar, just reload the page in a minute or
two and hopefully things will work.

As for site updates, I have updated the [timeline](Timeline) again with more
technological details (such as information about the LORE chip present
in pseudosentient AIs). I plan to write up the [Technology](Technology) page by the
end of the week, which will include more information about topics such
as education, genetic engineering, medicine, robotics, artificial
intelligence, travel, power sources (fusion and antimatter), mystic
magic, and computers. It will include some history but mostly focus on
their status in 2299.
