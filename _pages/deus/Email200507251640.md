Subject: Deus character deadlines reminder

Hi everyone,

Just wanted to remind everyone that Deus Ultionis character concepts
are due on August 1st (one week from today). All you need by then is a
concept, not a detailed backstory.

The following people still need to submit a concept:
*James, AJ, Megan, Jason

Jason: I know you are at camp so you don't actually have to have your
concept in by August 1st. I will try to get ahold of you soon though.

Detailed backstories including character questionnaire are due on
August 8th (two weeks from today).

The following people still need to submit a detailed backstory and
fill out the character questionnaire (linked from the System page):
*Paul, James, Eva, Danielle, Griffin, Lucas, Jon, AJ, Megan, Jason

Joey: You have a lot of detail on your character but haven't done the
questionnaire yet. It doesn't take long.

James: If Aaron and Fay (sp?) are going to play, they also need to
meet these deadlines.

&lt;/nag&gt;Lastly, the ((Technology|technology)) page will be updated before tomorrow
morning, I swear. The ((Worlds|worlds/colonies)) page may take a few more days,
however.

-Curtis
