Subject: first saturday session

Hi everyone,

The first session of the Deus Ultionis Saturday group (Eva, Griffin, James, John, Mike and Nate) is this coming Saturday, September 3rd, starting at 2:00 pm, at my house. For those who still need to finish their characters (e.g., merits &amp; flaws, character sheets, etc.), I invite you to show up as early as 10:00 am to work on those. Please contact me if you have any questions!

-Curtis
