Subject: first wednesday session

Hi everyone,

The first session of the Deus Ultionis Wednesday group (Athena, Danielle, Jason, Lucas, Mark, Ozzyie and Paul) is this coming Wednesday, September 7th, starting at 6:30 pm, at my house. For those who still need to finish their characters (e.g., merits &amp; flaws, character sheets, etc.), I invite you to show up as early as 5:30 pm to work on those. Please contact me if you have any questions!

-Curtis
