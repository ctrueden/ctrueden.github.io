Subject: first monday session

Hi everyone,

The first session of the Deus Ultionis Monday group (AJ, Alex, Allen, Andy, Joey and maybe Jon) is this coming Monday, September 12th, starting at 6:30 pm, at my house. For those who still need to finish their characters (e.g., merits &amp; flaws, character sheets, etc.), I invite you to show up as early as 5:30 pm to work on those. Please contact me if you have any questions!

-Curtis
