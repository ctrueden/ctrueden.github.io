Subject: advanced classes

Hi everyone,

In 2-3 weeks, everyone will have completed five sessions of the campaign, with enough experience to reach level 4. As you are no doubt already aware, this is the level I have pegged for people to start taking your character's (potentially customized) advanced class. I know that a number of you have not yet fleshed out your advanced class with me. Now is the time to send me the conceptual details of what you want your advanced class to do, so that I can write up the mechanics of the class and post it on your private page. Alternately, if you prefer to draft the class fully yourself, feel free to do so, and I'll ratify it.

-Curtis
