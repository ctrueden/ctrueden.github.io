Subject: probable joint session

Hi everyone,

It is quite likely that a joint session between the Monday and Wednesday groups will occur for session #7. Possible dates for this event include:

*Wednesday, Nov 30, 6:30 pm
*Monday, December 05, 6:30 pm
*Saturday, December 10, afternoon or evening

If everyone involved in Monday or Wednesday could let me know which day (if any) works best, that would be great.

Thanks,
Curtis
