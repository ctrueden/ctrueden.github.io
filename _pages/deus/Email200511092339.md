Subject: mystic magic FAQ

Hi everyone,

People keep asking me all kinds of stuff about mystic magic. I have put up a [http://restlesswarrior.com/deus/tiki-index.php?page=MagicPsionics|mystic magic FAQ] on the wiki.

Please let me know if anyone has additional questions not answered by this FAQ.

Thanks,
Curtis
