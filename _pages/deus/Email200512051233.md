<br>Subject: scheduling after winter break

Due to exams, holidays, and other scheduling difficulties, there will be no Deus Ultionis sessions until mid-to-late January.

The next Saturday session will be Sat 2006 Jan 21. Does that work for everyone?

For Monday and Wednesday, the next session will be the second half of the joint session. I have tentatively listed Wed 2006 Jan 18 on the web site for that. Alternately, we could do Wed 2006 Jan 11 (one week earlier) if everyone is going to be in town and available.

If you have a preference one way or the other, please let me know!

Thanks,
Curtis
