Hi everyone,

I hope everyone had a good winter break. It is almost time for Deus to resume!

As discussed, the conclusion to the Monday/Wednesday joint affair will be next Wednesday, January 11, at 6:30pm sharp, again at the Computer Sciences building on campus. I have heard from some people that which Mondays and Wednesday slots the game occupies is important, so we will reach a final decision as to subsequent Monday and Wednesday dates at the conclusion of the joint session.

The next Saturday session will be held Saturday, January 21, at 2:00pm, at my place. Subsequent sessions will follow on alternating weeks as usual.

Please note that the complete (tentative) Deus schedule is ((Story|posted online)).

If you have an issues with it, let me know as soon as possible so that alternate arrangements can be made.

Thanks,
Curtis
