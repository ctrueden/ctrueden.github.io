<br>Subject: joint monday/saturday session

Hi everyone,

We are on track for a joint session between the Monday and Saturday groups on Friday, February 17th at 6:00pm until around midnight. The tentative location is Joey's house (the &quot;big abode&quot;) on Erin St., but there is a possibility of Eva securing the Computer Sciences building for our use again. I will keep everyone posted as things develop.

The Monday group will be meeting on the Monday before, February 13th, at 6:30 pm at my house, to finalize plans and ensure that the things line up properly.

Also, the Wednesday group's next session will be next Wednesday, February 8th, at 6:30 pm.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

-Curtis
