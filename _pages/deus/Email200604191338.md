Subject: NPCs page

Hi everyone,

I have updated the [NPCs page](NonPlayerCharacters) with characters. So many characters! Argh. I put absolutely everyone I could think of on there. If you can think of any NPCs that I am missing, or there are any that do not work (i.e., access denied errors), please let me know.

Thanks,
-Curtis
