Subject: lots of scheduling stuff

Hi everyone,

Firstly, the upcoming session schedule is as follows:
*Saturday: [[15] 2006 Apr 29   
*Wednesday: [[15] 2006 May 03
*Monday: [[16] 2006 May 15

Secondly, Saturday and Wednesday's joint session (#16) was scheduled for Friday, May 19th, but some have expressed that Friday, May 26th might work better. Please let me know if the 26th is a problem for you, so that I know whether it is okay to switch it. If I do not hear any objections, I will switch the session to the 26th.

Lastly, keep in mind that the final session (#18) will take place on Saturday, June 17th. I'm just reminding everyone now, in case you have to give early notice at work to get the day off, or something.

-Curtis
