Hi,

I have posted [some closing thoughts on the campaign](http://restless-coder.livejournal.com/27378.html) in my LiveJournal.

Feel free to comment on anything related to the campaign whatsoever, and I'll reply as best I can.

Also, if you are looking for something to replace Deus, I suggest you consider Joey's KST campaign. It sounds like he's got an interesting story to tell, and possibly even more ambitious/crazy than me (four groups!).
