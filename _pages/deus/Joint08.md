If they allow Bryant to return to warn the Caretaker, he does so, and the Caretaker withers all the Heart Trees if Nyx opens the conduit (immediately before the antimatter explosion).

Before coming to this universe, Emmanuel sent out probing eddies, quasiphysical spatial and temporal distortions. The Destroyer, though it existed before Emmanuel's coming, became stronger by coalescing the eddies together and merging them, to gain a more powerful physical presence (sort of like how the Caretaker is twice as strong as Gaia and Emmanuel were).

Some of the eddies remain independent, but not many. They are naturally drawn to the Destroyer, and thus fewer and fewer are left. One of them, however, had the essence of a halfling attached to it when it happened across the newly formed Caretaker 265 years ago. This &quot;anti-halfling&quot; knows that it cannot return to Earth, or the Caretaker will dissect him. He has eternal wanderlust as he is drawn toward the Destroyer, but at the same time instinctually fears his journey's end.

Divin decides to drink the tainted blook of Everlily Nyx. Mystic levels are now tainted. He only refills spheres when others use mystic energy. Effects created around him suffer from backlash, as during Pax. But the backlash is half strength because he absorbs the other half, for his own use (it refills his spheres). He also gains all vampire weaknesses, including vulnerability to turning, though he is not undead proper. He develops a thirst for blood, with a bite attack. When he drains blood, people take Con damage. For each point of Con damage, he regains one Reserve point. If he drains someone completely, the victim rises up as a thrall (infected, similar to the Great Healer's plague zombies from Pax) under his control. Anyone bitten, even if not completely drained, must pass a Fort save to avoid becoming one of Meechum's thralls.

Divin/Meechum can now sense Cain's relative location at all times, but feels a stronger and stronger urge to obey him, and betray his friends. (His allegiance will switch to William Moss if/when Moss becomes the new undead master.) Meechum must pass Fortitude saves at first to avoid turning, then once one is failed, Will saves becoming harder over time to avoid betrayal.

He also has a bat form, and a wolf form, and possesses Regeneration 1 while in these forms.

He takes double damage from anything &quot;natural&quot; such as wooden stakes.

At some point in the future, his loyalty to William Moss will be affected or severed somehow, and that event will correspond to his 6th level Shattered power, the birth of Unity.
