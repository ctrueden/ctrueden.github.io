### Davis, the Syndicate, Pipwhistle, the white virus, and the Damocles project

''&lt;obsolete&gt;''
''Ron Davis is a member of the Syndicate, and represents part of StratCo's Syndicate ties. He arranged for Reginald Pipwhistle's parents to have their careers crushed, to intimidate Pipwhistle into continuing his research with the white virus. The Syndicate is responsible for the Damocles Experiments -- specifically, Vittorio is behind them. It was a move to oppose the portion of the Syndicate trying to put the Caretaker's plan into motion.''

''Vittorio has a good chance of remembering something about &quot;Damocles Experiment&quot; being relevant to his old life.''

''Davis was one of Vittorio's supporters, and is continuing to push for the Damocles Experiment research to be completed. He opposes the Caretaker, and McLean's current control.''

''Magitech, Adana and Evan were involved in the conspiracy to ruin Gaddelsmocks. So the only remaining question is: why did Magitech hire Jason's character to &quot;steal&quot; the Delta ship? The answer: though McLean was unable to obtain control of the Damocles Experiments, he was taking steps to shut down the project. After DEE, no further ships were being constructed. The Damocles project had become very insular, with the leading scientist refusing to yield control to anyone. Thus, with Vittorio dead, Magitech could not properly continue the research -- it was falling apart. To regain control, they wanted DEE and/or DED brought back to them, so that they could resume things from there on Luna.''

See [Monday17](Monday17) for an up-to-date explanation of the above events.

Bernstein tells Ariona that he is resigning his position at U-Pax to take a full-time post at StratCo on Earth in Glacialis. He says it has been a pleasure working with her, and that he considers their research successfully completed. He offers to write her a stellar reference for her next place of employ.


### Procuring Cain's body

The Gaians are distrustful of the party, even after they find out Ariona is half-elven (a half-elven guy named Morningbird -- Speed Demon &amp; Anna's son, Lefty's step-brother -- was just chased out after it was discovered that he was a spy for the Luna faction). But Ariona's celestial blood also throws some weight. They can gain audience with the Caretaker after a couple of days if they are diplomatic.

The Caretaker tells the Monday group to assist Moss in any way they can, and that he indeed serves the interests of all Terrans.

See [Monday03](Monday03) for details on the means with which the PCs can infiltrate Magitech's seventh basement level.

The sixth and seventh Magitech basements are warded against all mystic magic.

Cain's body is inside a stasis chamber. The chamber is pressure sensitive, so that when the body is removed (or the entire chamber itself is moved), the silent alarm is tripped.

Cain's presence has been poisoning Magitech slowly, and all of a sudden it has gotten much, much worse (due to the proximity of Cain's hand). Adana decides that something must be done, quickly. She knows that Moss plans to obtain the body eventually. She hopes to cut a deal wherein he relinquishes the sanctum in exchange for the body. But contacting him is not easy, so she cuts a deal with vampires, telling them that she will arrange for the body's availability in exchange for their cooperation in ousting Moss from his sanctum. She then waits for the raiding party (the PCs plus four vampires), and reiterates her offer in person after they have recovered the body (which she knows happens because of the pressure sensor and potentially other mechanisms). The point is to ensure Moss leaves the sanctum, and Cain's body ends up with the vampires.

Despite all this, Adana is afraid of Cain's awakening, tainted or not. She rigs his body with a Pyro 20 effect that will attempt to incinerate the Hand (since the body seems nigh indestructible) if they attempt to reattach it. This works to a point -- the hand itself is incinerated instantly (including the metallic coating). But the hand contained pure backlash accumulated from the Great Healer, and this backlash seeps into Cain's body, and awakens him. He then regrows his hand, and feeds on all nearby vampires.

Cain goes on a rampage across Earth, destroying all undead he encounters. Gaia's Order isn't sure what to think about this behavior. During the day, he enters a comatose state away from sunlight. Attempts to destroy Cain while he sleeps are unsuccessful -- it simply awakens him and he is pissed.
