Mystic feat for &quot;toggling warding&quot; -- costs twice the normal reserve warding costs, but effect can be freely toggled until the warding wears off

------

Another mystic feat for permanently infusing a warded ability (like Tenacious Spell sort of? Where the effect is only gone for 1d4 rounds when dispelled and then returns). Requires the *permanent* consumption of the Reserve though.

------

Flight (perfect) - Kin 1 per 10 ft + 1 div for mental control (others only)

------

By doubling the cost of a spell, it can penetrate twice as much of a barrier. (e.g., stone walls, etc.)

------

Pyrotechnics elemental shield.
Specify an element:
Pyro 1 -&gt; protect against 2 damage per round of chosen type.
+1 - +2 damage per round protection

------

Optional rule: mystic bards need to make sound to do mystic effects, like real bards do. If this rule is in effect, they get to keep countersong as an ability.

------

Improve Pyrotechnics ball &amp; remote explosion explanation to mention that you have to double the normal cost to turn it into an area effect of the desired type...

------

Div 3: simple state triggers
Sometimes, you want the trigger to detect things far away... use normal range modifiers

------

Enh 2: grant lowlight vision (minutes)

------

Enh 4: grant darkvision (minutes)

------

Enh 4: raise flight by one type (average -&gt; good, good -&gt; perfect, etc.) (temporary [[minutes])

------

Enh 5: make an object ghost touch (temporary [[minutes])

------

Heal 2: cure 1 temp ability damage; +1 for 1 additional point of temp damage

------

Heal 6: cure 1 negative level; +1 for 1 additional negative level

------

Div 4, Enh 4, Mind 2, Port 1
Put a sensor on an item so that you can continually determine its general location--distance &amp; direction. (Temporary [[minutes])

------

Illus X - Undetectable aura - X is power of aura needing to be hidden (where &quot;power&quot; is the mystic level of the effect -- in the above case, that would be 4).

------

Illusion costs double to do a lack of something, rather than a false something. (Thus, invisibility costs double.)

------

Div cost is value squared in EP.  So, Div 5 question is 25 EP.
<br>Div 10 question is 100 EP.  Div 2 would only be 4 EP...

------

Maximum value of item is SP squared for creation.
<br>So, a 100 gp item would take a minimum of Creat 10 to make.
<br>But you don't pay EXTRA for more value... it's just a minimum cost.

------

Third, you have to deal with linking to create wish-level magic!  Can it be
done?  If so, how is the EP cost split?

Fifth, I assume that mystic clerics can't combine points from multiple spheres
when spontaneously casting heal spells, but rather just spend, say, a level 5
pyro as a level 5 healing.  This should be stated outright, though.

Ninth, in the overdraw feat, you state &quot;Assuming the effect is successful, treat
it as though the mystic actually spent the full amount for the effect, rather
than a lesser amount with Overdraw.&quot;  I assume that this means for the purpose
of computing effects, not for actual point cost to the mystic.
Also, suppose I'm a level twenty mystic with ten points left in healing and
the overdraw feat.  Can I use overdraw to (possibly) cast a level two healing
by only spending one point?  Or is overdraw good only for casting effects
beyond your caster level?  Again, slightly unclear.

Otherwise, I have a few questions: can you use more sphere points to increase the
amount of time a temporary effect lasts? (for example, spend extra enhancement to
make you shorter for hours rather than minutes?  Or do I just have to ward it?)
Also, do other metals besides iron interfere with mystic energies?  Could a mystic
wear a silver ring?  And what happens if a mystic steps into a big iron room?  And
can a mystic make a magical iron item, such as an iron helmet that makes you see
details better?  Also, what do mystics who create magical items spend the requisite
gold on?  Does it just disappear?  Is it the price of material goods?  Is it the
lowest allowable price of the object to be enchanted, or do you have to pay extra to
actually buy the object?  Lastly, can I uncreate some acid which has already done
damage?  And if I create something very hot, then want to uncreate it, do I take
damage from touching it?

Last, I'd recommend that in a future revision, you give examples (like in the DMG)
of mystic items that could be created, what they'd cost to create (both exp and gold,
with a total market price).  Just as a partial list of what items you could include:

&quot;Ralpho's Mug of Never-Ending Ale&quot;, &quot;Pocket Handkerchief of Hardiness&quot;, &quot;Trevin's Staff of Destructo-beams&quot;, &quot;Orcsicle&quot;, &quot;Anklet of Haste&quot;, &quot;Ellwood's Flask of Very Hot Acid&quot;, &quot;Pip's Cloak of Foolishness&quot;, and &quot;Sparky, the Friendly Fireball.&quot;

Next revision
* Gravitational effects &amp; magnetism
* Shields to block mystic effects of certain spheres, or block physical attacks
* Pyrotechnic shields of energy
* Kinetic walls &amp; shields of air
* Flight w/ Kinetics (should be covered, but give as an example?)
* Optional Div rule: 2% chance per Div rank to do a knowledge acquisition for no EP
* Healing + Transmutation to correct a permanently petrified individual (e.g.)
* Linking for wish-level: how does the EP split?

Notes from Curt:
* Add mystic cantrips: DM discretion for small effects being free to use.
    * maybe a feat focusing on a specific sphere? (Mystic Cantrip)
    * allows minimized level 1 effects for free
    * perhaps exclude Healing damage &amp; certain other effects or spheres
* Mention optional rules:
    * time traveling with Displacement
    * linking
    * wish-level magic cap (discuss in relation to Epic rules)
    * different ways to do resurrection
    * stat-burning - each sphere has a tied stat that can be hit with ability damage to gain extra mystic power in a hurry:
        * Creation = Con
        * Destruction = Str
        * Displacement = Dex
        * Divination = Wis
        * Enhancement = Int
        * Healing = Wis
        * Illusion = Cha
        * Kinetics = Dex
        * Mind Control = Cha
        * Pyrotechnics = Str
        * Transmutation = Con
        * Reserve = Int (note this trumps Enh... maybe 1/2 rate?)
* When two or more people are fighting for an item, and someone attempts to use Mystic on the item, anyone who doesn't want the item to be affected can still make a Will save to avoid the effect, but others can make opposing Will saves to will the item to *be* affected.  Basically, whoever's Will save wins, gets to choose if the item is affected (unless all Will saves fail the Mystic DC, in which case it is affected regardless).
* Alter/clarify level cap for primary sphere level -- only maximum primary sphere is affected by cap, not mixed in spheres. Thus, a 5th level caster can do a Pyro 5 + Div 1 fireball just fine, and that caster could also do a Mind 5 + Div 5 dual primary sphere effect (since neither primary is greater than 5).
* Mention again in Warding section that converted temporary effects cannot be warded.
* Work on Illusion... static Illusions versus mutable Illusions versus movable Illusions... how broken is it to have a permanent, warded &quot;pet&quot; illusion that is movable &amp; mutable?
