-=Adana Cassenti=-

Adana is one of [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/sara.html|Sara Cassenti's] twin children, and ((OrgMagitech|Magitech's)) chief executive. She is a regal woman with fine facial structure, brown hair, green eyes and a cool demeanor.

Though opposed to the Deus rite, she ultimately admitted she had no better option and consigned herself to the lesser of two evils. She has had a difficult time dealing with the Deus rite, ((CharPublicGriffin|DEE's)) devastation of Pax Artificium, and ((NPCMordred|Mordred's)) corruption of her ex-husband ((NPCEvan|Evan)).
