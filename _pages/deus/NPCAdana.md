Adana is one of [Sara Cassenti's](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/sara.html) twin children, and [Magitech's](OrgMagitech) chief executive. She is a regal woman with fine facial structure, brown hair, green eyes and a cool demeanor.

Though opposed to the Deus rite, she ultimately admitted she had no better option and consigned herself to the lesser of two evils. She has had a difficult time dealing with the Deus rite, [DEE's](CharPublicGriffin) devastation of Pax Artificium, and [Mordred's](NPCMordred) corruption of her ex-husband [Evan](NPCEvan).
