Albus became the new head of the [Arcane Order](OrgArcaneOrder) after [Yeslek's](/pax/npcs/yeslek.html) untimely death during the Pax Artificium campaign. He presided over the Order from 2034 until 2299, at which time he died of old age and was succeeded by [Iason](NPCIason).

He practiced a strict policy of non-interference with the outside world, and exiled seven recalcitrant wizards who refused to abide by the rules: [Soren]((NPCSoren), [Jendu](NPCJendu), [Tungoa](NPCTungoa), [Sai](NPCSai), [Vixlecais](NPCVix), [Morgan](NPCMorgan) and [Aldan](NPCAldan) -- along with their son [Merlin](NPCMerlin), who chose to leave with his parents rather than remain on the island).
