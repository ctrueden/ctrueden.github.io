Anat is the first daughter of [Adana](NPCAdana) and [Evan](NPCEvan). She is named for [Seth's](http://www.christiananswers.net/bible/gen5.html) first wife in [ancient Egyptian legend](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Ithaca/4396/wives.htm).

She is very beautiful, and until her death at DEE's hands during the Pax Artificium assault, was [Magitech's](OrgMagitech) public relations spokeswoman.
