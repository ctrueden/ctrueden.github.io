Beck is a professor of mathematics and astrophysics, and founder of the Percepi colony. He is one of the handful of royals who has made his home away from Midgard. Beck's vision was of a world on the known frontiers of space where those who pursue scientific inquiry could gather and share knowledge. Over the past 20 or so years, the experiment was largely a success, as Percepi became a haven for acadamia. However, tragedy struck when Percepi was enveloped by [the Void](NPCDestroyer), and Beck was one among the approximately 4.6 billion residents who simply ceased to exist.
