Benek is one of two elven guardians (the other being [Sartus Morningdew](NPCSartus)) originally responsible for the protection of [Sara Cassenti](/pax/pcs/sara.html) during the Pax Artificium era. Since the birth of Sara's children, [Adana](NPCAdana) and [Evan](NPCEvan) Cassenti, Sartus and Benek have pledged to protect them, so that their race can once again grow and prosper. Benek has not been observed for quite some time now, though if he has not faded completely, he most likely continues to act as silent protector for Evan Cassenti.

Benek was [an NPC](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/benek.html) during Pax Artificium.
