-=Rudolf Bernstein=-

Bernstein is a scientist who has recently disappeared. He was working on understanding the link between genetics and mysticism. He typically dresses in a traditional, brightly colored Hawaiian T-shirt and large, baggy shorts, and wears a broad-brimmed hat to cover his balding pate (even indoors). Bernstein's face is ruddy with a prominent nose, and the hair he has left is a dark blonde.
