-=Bianca Falconi=-

A large, muscular woman, Bianca serves as one of ((NPCOrlando|Orlando Garibaldi's)) bodyguards. She is sometimes crass and often short-tempered, but also has a hidden sweet side.

She was part of the ((OrgSyndicate|Syndicate)) mass suicide conspiracy, and was forced to kill her own husband ((NPCEmilio|Emilio)) to prevent him from revealing the truth.
