Jonathan is [Max](CharPublicNate)'s father. He has recently awakened from a coma lasting nearly three years, and resumed control of his dying company, [Mercabah Technologies](OrgMercabah).

He is an active member of the Naturalist movement, supporting technological solutions nondestructive to the environment, and thus has sponsored a lot of Gaian innovations. It was recently discovered that he had a secret arrangement with [StratCo](OrgStratCo) wherein Mercabah partially funded the development of the Damocles Epsilon series of experimental ships designed to extract mystic energy from enemy targets, the main purpose of which was to help oppose the [Caretaker](NPCCaretaker) should it take any questionable or unwarranted action (in particular, rumors of a forced merger between [Luna](NPCLuna) and [Cain](NPCCain) had begun to surface).
