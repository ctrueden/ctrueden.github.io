-=Emilio Falconi=-

Emilio is a thin, somewhat weasely fellow, often nervous but good with guns. Despite his appearance, however, he has managed to have a continuous string of girlfriends throughout his youth. He is one of ((NPCOrlando|Orlando Garibaldi's)) bodyguards.

He was recently assassinated to prevent him from revealing too much about the Syndicate mass suicide to ((CharPublicAllen|Vittorio)).
