Etnia is the grandson of four members of the seven Arcane Order exiles, [Jendu Gryffindor](NPCJendu), [Tungoa Hufflepuff](NPCTungoa), [Sai Ravenclaw](NPCSai) and [Vixlecais Slytherin](NPCVix). He continued the [Pandora's Box](OrgPandora) work begun by his grandparents, and eventually made several breakthroughs enabling him to complete the organization's original goal. However, before he could apply the results of his research to the remaining test subjects, he burned to death in the fire that destroyed the Pandora's Box compound, along with his work.
