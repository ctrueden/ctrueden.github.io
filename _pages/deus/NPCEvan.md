Evan is one of [Sara Cassenti's](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/sara.html) twin children. Within the last few decades, he had a falling out with his wife [Adana](NPCAdana), and left [Magitech](OrgMagitech). After that, he took a position at [StratCo](OrgStratCo), and has since become its chief executive.

His activities during that time have been veiled in mystery, but he was recently affected by [Mordred's](NPCMordred) corruption and participated in the Deus rite. Though he and [Gerald](NPCGerald) briefly confronted one another, [Ariona](CharPublicAlex) begged [Gerald](NPCGerald) not to kill him, and he quickly escaped. Later, the Saturday group staged a trade with him for his ex-wife Adana in exchange for [Zee's](CharPublicJames) parents [Varick](NPCVarick) and [Elsa](NPCElsa), and managed to subdue him during the encounter and revert him to his normal form.
