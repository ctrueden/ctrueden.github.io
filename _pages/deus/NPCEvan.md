-=Evan Cassenti=-

Evan is one of [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/sara.html|Sara Cassenti's] twin children. Within the last few decades, he had a falling out with his wife ((NPCAdana|Adana)), and left ((OrgMagitech|Magitech)). After that, he took a position at ((OrgStratCo|StratCo)), and has since become its chief executive.

His activities during that time have been veiled in mystery, but he was recently affected by ((NPCMordred|Mordred's)) corruption and participated in the Deus rite. Though he and ((NPCGerald|Gerald)) briefly confronted one another, ((CharPublicAlex|Ariona)) begged ((NPCGerald|Gerald)) not to kill him, and he quickly escaped. Later, the Saturday group staged a trade with him for his ex-wife Adana in exchange for ((CharPublicJames|Zee's)) parents ((NPCVarick|Varick)) and ((NPCElsa|Elsa)), and managed to subdue him during the encounter and revert him to his normal form.
