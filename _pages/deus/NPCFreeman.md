Freeman is an android, and until recently one of [Scorpio's](NPCScorpio) servants -- together with [Capricorn](NPCCapricorn) and [Aries](NPCAries), Scorpio hacked Freeman while they were being transferred out of storage for termination, then betrayed his comrades, locking them out of the android's systems and ordering Freeman to carry him to safety.

Freeman then served a brief stint as [Cain's](NPCCain) henchman, at which time he was sent to Laboro to recover skilled slaves whose absence would not be noticed whose souls Cain could consume to gain knowledge. However, while there, Freeman was awakened by [DEE](CharPublicGriffin) and became one of his twelve disciples.
