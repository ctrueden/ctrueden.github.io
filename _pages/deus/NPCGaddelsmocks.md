Gaddelsmocks is a gnomish reporter who entertains crackpot theories about corporate and government conspiracy. Lately she has been pushing the idea that ((OrgStratCo|StratCo)) and ((OrgMagitech|Magitech)) are actually the same company, even though in actuality they are bitter rivals. She was recently fired for evidence planting regarding the ((NPCBernstein|Bernstein)) abduction incident.
