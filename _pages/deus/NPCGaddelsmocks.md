Gaddelsmocks is a gnomish reporter who entertains crackpot theories about corporate and government conspiracy. Lately she has been pushing the idea that [StratCo](OrgStratCo) and [Magitech](OrgMagitech) are actually the same company, even though in actuality they are bitter rivals. She was recently fired for evidence planting regarding the [Bernstein](NPCBernstein) abduction incident.
