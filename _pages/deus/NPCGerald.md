Gerald, the king of the dwarves of Midgard, is often gruff and suspicious, but beneath his dour attitude he is a fierce friend. He is also the general of the dwarven spellbreaker army. His marriage to [Xela](NPCXela), queen of the gnomes, unified the dwarven/gnomish kingdom of Midgard after centuries of war. He led the army of Midgard against the [New Lunar Order](OrgLuna) during the Deus rite confrontation, and together with [Seeker](NPCSeeker) defeated [Mordred](NPCMordred) in deadly combat.

Gerald is [Nate's character](/pax/pcs/gerald.html) from Pax Artificium.
