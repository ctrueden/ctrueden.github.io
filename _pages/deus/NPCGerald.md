-=Gerald=-

Gerald, the king of the dwarves of Midgard, is often gruff and suspicious, but beneath his dour attitude he is a fierce friend. He is also the general of the dwarven spellbreaker army. His marriage to ((NPCXela|Xela)), queen of the gnomes, unified the dwarven/gnomish kingdom of Midgard after centuries of war. He led the army of Midgard against the ((OrgLuna|New Lunar Order)) during the Deus rite confrontation, and together with ((NPCSeeker|Seeker)) defeated ((NPCMordred|Mordred)) in deadly combat.

Gerald is [/pax/pcs/gerald.html|Nate's character] from Pax Artificium.
