Ivan is the third-oldest Volokhov brother. Until recently, his family ran the Canis government. He was recently slain by [Max Cohen](CharPublicNate)'s grey goo, at which point his soul was absorbed into [Matt Smith](CharPublicJohn)'s nanite picoweb, where it settled in and has since been unable to be extricated. Ivan is the strong, silent type, often quick to anger but also good at sitting back, detached, and analyzing the situation. He is perhaps the most blunt and honest of the Volokhov brothers, with a sense of humor to match. His mystic specialties are [Pyrotechnics](/gaming/mystic/pyrotechics.html) and [Displacement](/gaming/mystic/displacement.html).
