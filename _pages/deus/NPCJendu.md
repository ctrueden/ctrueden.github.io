Jendu was one of the seven members of the Arcane Order exiled by [Albus](NPCAlbus) for failing to adhere to the Order's noninterference policy. Along with three of the other exiles [Tungoa]((NPCTungoa), [Sai](NPCSai) and [Vix](NPCVix)), he formed [Pandora's Box](OrgPandora), a group devoted to bettering humanity's mystic potential through genetic and mystic manipulation.

Jendu and Tungoa produced a son, [Etnia's](NPCEtnia) father.
