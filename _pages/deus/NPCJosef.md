-=Josef=-

This man with one hand doesn't remember much about who he was. He claims the last date he remembers is 2050. With ((CharPublicMike|Vadril Korlax))'s help, he also remembered that [/pax/pcs/josef.html|his brother] betrayed him, and a [/pax/npcs/healer.html|cloaked man] healed him. He looks to be about 5' 10&quot;, 130 lbs, with black hair and eyes, and a mixed caucasian and hispanic background. He appears just shy of middle age.

Josef was [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/josef.html|an NPC] during Pax Artificium.
