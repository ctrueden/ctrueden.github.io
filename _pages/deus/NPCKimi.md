Eagle Talon is a lean, feral-looking vampire with wild hair and claws. Her name means &quot;secret&quot; in Algonquin. She is one of the four vampires who were collaborating with [William Moss](NPCMoss) and assisted in [Cain](NPCCain)'s retrieval from [Magitech](OrgMagitech) HQ. She teamed up with the [New Lunar Order](OrgLuna) to attack the Deus rite, but managed to escape. Her current whereabouts are unknown.
