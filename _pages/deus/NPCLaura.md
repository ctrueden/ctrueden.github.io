-=Laura Morningbird=-

Finesse is the daughter of ((NPCAnna|Snow White)) and ((NPCMoses|Speed Demon)), and sister to ((NPCMarcus|Bullettrain)). Her costume is a full-length black leotard, black toolbelt with gravitic drive and short blue jacket with &quot;F&quot; logo. Unlike the rest of her family, she has no powers and never took well to the superhero gig, despite her father's encouragement. She disappeared some years back, and Bullettrain has been trying to find her ever since.

It was recently confirmed that she had taken on the supervillain persona of ((NPCStrife|Strife)), which ((CharPublicDanielle|Fey)) convinced her to renounce.
