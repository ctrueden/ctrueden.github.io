-=Lilith=-

Lilith is the newly formed gestalt entity composed of ((NPCLuna|Luna)), the spirit of the moon, and ((NPCCain|Cain)), the first human touched by Emmanuel, who had been empowered by the ((NPCOversoul|Oversoul)). She was created against Luna's will, but has had no time to ponder her situation, as the first thing she heard upon her awakening was the terrible echoes of the ((NPCDestroyer|Destroyer)).

Lilith appears as a nine-year-old girl with long black hair, black eyes, lips and eyebrows, perfectly white skin, pointed ears, burgeoning horns and a visible glowing orange third eye. She is garbed in a shimmering cloth of moonbeams.
