Lilith is the newly formed gestalt entity composed of [Luna](NPCLuna), the spirit of the moon, and [Cain](NPCCain), the first human touched by Emmanuel, who had been empowered by the [Oversoul](NPCOversoul). She was created against Luna's will, but has had no time to ponder her situation, as the first thing she heard upon her awakening was the terrible echoes of the [Destroyer](NPCDestroyer).

Lilith appears as a nine-year-old girl with long black hair, black eyes, lips and eyebrows, perfectly white skin, pointed ears, burgeoning horns and a visible glowing orange third eye. She is garbed in a shimmering cloth of moonbeams.
