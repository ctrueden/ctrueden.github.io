Luna is the spirit of Earth's moon, just as Gaia is Earth's spirit. Luna is newly awakened, having attained consciousness less than ten years ago, and as such still functions much as a young child, with a very limited comprehension of the maelstrom of events surrounding her. She was recently merged against her will with [Cain](NPCCain) and the [Oversoul](NPCOversoul), becoming the gestalt entity [Lilith](NPCLilith).

Before becoming Lilith, Luna appeared as a five-year-old girl with green hair and tattered clothes.
