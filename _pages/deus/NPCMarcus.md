Bullettrain is ((NPCMoses|Speed Demon's)) son. As he grew up, he developed extreme quickness, super strength and durability, similar to that of his father, but not including flight. Bullettrain fights by charging his enemies, ramming into them at high speeds to knock them out. To facilitate this strategy, he wears a reinforced costume with speeding train logos up and down the arms. He has been looking for his sister, ((NPCLaura|Finesse)), for several years, and finally found her.
