McLean was a scientist and enterpreneur interested in the practical applications of nanites. He was working with the royals on a secret project, and had arranged a demonstration for ((OrgMercabah|Mercabah)) on Mercury colony. But something went hideously wrong, and the nanites enveloped the planet over the course of a mere 24 hours, killing everyone.
