Huntington is a powerful mystic in service to [General Khan Ji-Tae](NPCKhan). His features are those of someone from northern Europe, and he has been seen wearing a hooded brown robe.

He has helped the Saturday group on numerous occasions, and was responsible for preventing [Sulphur](NPCSulphur) and [Salt](NPCSalt) from piggybacking on the [Oversoul](NPCOversoul) during the Deus rite.
