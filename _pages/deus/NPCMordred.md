A mysterious man was found sealed within a reinforced stasis chamber in the depths of Magitech headquarters. Is he related to the [Mordred of Arthurian legend](http://www.google.com/search?q=mordred)? Why was he sealed behind three feet of transparent composite alloy?

Though these questions have not been definitively answered, Mordred's corrupting influence spread quickly. After being free for only four days, he arrived at the Deus rite outside the [Caretaker's](NPCCaretaker) protective shield with a twisted army who had been physically transformed by Mordred's power -- humans had become orcs, dwarves were duergar, gnomes were goblins and halflings were imps. In particular, [Evan Cassenti](NPCEvan) was present in the form of a drow.

Though Mordred had performed a necromantic ritual that prevented him from being killed, he was nevertheless defeated in combat by [Seeker](NPCSeeker) and [Gerald](NPCGerald), who performed a devastating combo maneuver consisting of Seeker's 2265-year punch and Gerald's unstoppable charge attack with the legendary sword of destiny.
