[William Moss](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/pete.html) is the former CEO of [Magitech Corporation](OrgMagitech). He disappeared from view shortly after World War IV along with [Everlily Nyx](NPCNyx). He is 5' 9&quot; with plain brown hair. Until recently he had taken to wearing glasses, with his clothes rumpled and unkempt, lending him the look of an absent-minded professor. For a time, he reverted to his &quot;Crazy Pete&quot; persona (an eccentric homeless man) to hide from his many enemies.

After taking [Cain's](NPCCain) undead essence upon himself, Moss reunited with Nyx, traveled to Mars and established Alexandria, a subterranean necropolis.

Crazy Pete (William Moss) was [Kelsey's first character](/pax/pcs/pete.html) from Pax Artificium.
