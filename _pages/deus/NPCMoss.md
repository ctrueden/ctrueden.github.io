-=William Moss=-

[http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/pete.html|William Moss] is the former CEO of ((OrgMagitech|Magitech Corporation)). He disappeared from view shortly after World War IV along with ((NPCNyx|Everlily Nyx)). He is 5' 9&quot; with plain brown hair. Until recently he had taken to wearing glasses, with his clothes rumpled and unkempt, lending him the look of an absent-minded professor. For a time, he reverted to his &quot;Crazy Pete&quot; persona (an eccentric homeless man) to hide from his many enemies.

After taking ((NPCCain|Cain's)) undead essence upon himself, Moss reunited with Nyx, traveled to Mars and established Alexandria, a subterranean necropolis.

Crazy Pete (William Moss) was [/pax/pcs/pete.html|Kelsey's first character] from Pax Artificium.
