-=Daniel Ocean=-

Ocean is a master thief. He somehow managed to steal the Crown from ((OrgMagitech|Magitech Corporation)), but instead of selling to ((NPCBryant|Harry Bryant)) as agreed, Ocean double-crossed him and sold to ((NPCVolokhov|Mikhael Volokhov)) for a higher price. Ocean then lurked around Canis for a while, taking in ((NPCJasmine|Jasmine de Vide)) as an apprentice until the Lupus/Canis war started. He fled the colony, and his current whereabouts are unknown.
