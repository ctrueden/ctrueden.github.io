Orlando is [Vittorio's](CharPublicAllen) father, and a fairly important man in the New York City area Mafia. Officially, he owns a restaurant, the Grand Picino Restaurante Italiano. He recently learned that his son is still alive (in a manner of speaking) and tried to have him killed. When that failed, he reluctantly agreed to give Vittorio a second chance in the family business.
