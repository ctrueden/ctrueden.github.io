-=Penelope Pandemonium=-

Pandemonium is a gnomish spellbreaker (!) in ((NPCXela|Xela))'s service. She is very outgoing, and often takes on the role of spokeswoman when sent on missions. Her mastery in a field dominated by dwarven males has netted her the nickname &quot;Squeaky Fierce&quot; (&quot;squeak&quot; is derogatory slang for gnomes, and &quot;grunt&quot; for dwarves).
