Zarkovsky is a hideous monstrosity of a vampire. He is one of the four vampires who were collaborating with [William Moss](NPCMoss) and assisted in [Cain](NPCCain)'s retrieval from [Magitech](OrgMagitech) HQ. He teamed up with the [New Lunar Order](OrgLuna) to attack the Deus rite, but managed to escape. His current whereabouts are unknown.
