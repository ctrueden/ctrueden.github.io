-=Ramses Corsair=-

Ramses is the grandson of ((NPCSoren|Soren Corsair)), one of the Seven exiled from the island of the Arcane Order. He was interested in the human experiments being performed by ((OrgPandora|Pandora's Box)) and joined up, eventually becoming ((NPCEtnia|Etnia Gryffinclaw's)) right-hand man.

After the fire resulting in the destruction of the Pandora's Box compound, Ramses disappeared. He later reunited with ((NPCStrife|Strife)), resumed the Pandora's Box research, and integrated a variant of the research results into her genome.

Ramses was recently apprehended by ((NPCSeeker|Seeker)) and ((NPCMarcus|Bullettrain)). The Arcane Order has put him on trial for his crimes against humanity, resulting from his continuing disregard for the Order's policy of noninterference in world affairs.
