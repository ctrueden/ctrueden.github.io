Ramses is the grandson of [Soren Corsair](NPCSoren), one of the Seven exiled from the island of the Arcane Order. He was interested in the human experiments being performed by [Pandora's Box](OrgPandora) and joined up, eventually becoming [Etnia Gryffinclaw's](NPCEtnia) right-hand man.

After the fire resulting in the destruction of the Pandora's Box compound, Ramses disappeared. He later reunited with [Strife](NPCStrife), resumed the Pandora's Box research, and integrated a variant of the research results into her genome.

Ramses was recently apprehended by [Seeker](NPCSeeker) and [Bullettrain](NPCMarcus). The Arcane Order has put him on trial for his crimes against humanity, resulting from his continuing disregard for the Order's policy of noninterference in world affairs.
