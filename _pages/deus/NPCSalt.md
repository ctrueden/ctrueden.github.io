Salt is one of the three shards of the Occultem Lapidem. Until recently, it was in the possession of [Harry Bryant](NPCBryant). During an incident on Lupus, the Salt glyph was destroyed by [Zee](CharPublicJames).

It was later learned that destroying the glyphs merely unbound that portion of the Occultem Lapidem's power, making it more difficult to control. Salt hid in the Crown until the day of the Deus rite, when (along with [Sulphur](NPCSulphur)) it tried to leap into the [Oversoul](NPCOversoul) just as [Cain](NPCCain) consumed it. Huntington stopped them, however, by trapping them in a wall of force and then sealing them into the empty onyx stone formerly housing the Oversoul.
