-=Selena Sharptooth=-

Selena is a werewolf, and influential member of the New Lunar Order. She, along with other New Lunar Order members including ((NPCNyx|Everlily Nyx)), blames the Caretaker for the recent tragedies of Percepi and Mercury.

Recently, she was responsible for the New Lunar Order's failed assault during the Deus rite. When her forces turned against her upon seeing the horror of ((NPCMordred|their ally)) and his corrupted army, she fled, but was quickly captured.
