Seth is the third son of [Adana](NPCAdana) and [Evan](NPCEvan) Cassenti. He was a researcher and pilot in [Magitech's](OrgMagitech) space travel research program, and helped develop (highly classified) experimental organic ships. He was sent after [DEE](CharPublicGriffin), who currently had custody of [Cain's](NPCCain) body, and killed when his craft was largely destroyed.
