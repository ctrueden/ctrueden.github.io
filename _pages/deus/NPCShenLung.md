Shen-Lung is the gold dragon representative on the Council of Wyrms, presiding over the metallic dragons. He is wise and just, and strives to hear all sides of an argument before reaching a decision.

He recently learned that his former lover [Ti-Lung](NPCTiLung) was reborn into the soul of a [young man](CharPublicJames), and has pledged to come to his (her?) aid should he be in peril.
