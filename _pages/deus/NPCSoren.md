Soren was one of the seven members of the [Arcane Order](OrgArcaneOrder) exiled for disagreeing with its policy of noninterference in world affairs. He was very forceful, acting as spokesperson for those who wished to &quot;use our powers for the betterment of humanity, as we once did.&quot;

[Albus](NPCAlbus), the head of the Arcane Order, exiled Soren, along with six other members -- [Morgan](NPCMorgan), [Aldan](NPCAldan), [Jendu](NPCJendu), [Tungoa](NPCTungoa), [Sai](NPCSai) and [Vixlecais](NPCVix) -- for &quot;unrepentant disregard for the Order's rules of conduct.&quot;

Soren was later slain by [Speed Demon](NPCMoses) during World War III.
