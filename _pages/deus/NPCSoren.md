-=Soren Corsair=-

Soren was one of the seven members of the ((OrgArcaneOrder|Arcane Order)) exiled for disagreeing with its policy of noninterference in world affairs. He was very forceful, acting as spokesperson for those who wished to &quot;use our powers for the betterment of humanity, as we once did.&quot;

((NPCAlbus|Albus)), the head of the Arcane Order, exiled Soren, along with six other members -- ((NPCMorgan|Morgan)), ((NPCAldan|Aldan)), ((NPCJendu|Jendu)), ((NPCTungoa|Tungoa)), ((NPCSai|Sai)) and ((NPCVix|Vixlecais)) -- for &quot;unrepentant disregard for the Order's rules of conduct.&quot;

Soren was later slain by ((NPCMoses|Speed Demon)) during World War III.
