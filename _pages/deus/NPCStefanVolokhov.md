-=Stefan Volokhov=-

Stefan is the second-oldest Volokhov brother. Until recently, his family ran the Canis government. Stefan is gracious and shrewd, and often bargained on ((NPCVolokhov|Mikhael))'s behalf when trading antiques and other valuables. He is perhaps the smartest of the brothers. He disappeared around the time of Mikhael's capture, and his current whereabouts are unknown. His mystic specialties are [/gaming/mystic/enhancement.html|Enhancement], [/gaming/mystic/healing.html|Healing] and [/gaming/mystic/displacement.html|Displacement].
