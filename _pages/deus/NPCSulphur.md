-=Sulphur=-

Sulphur is one of the three shards of the Occultem Lapidem. Until recently, it was in the possession of ((CharPublicNate|Max Cohen)). ((NPCBryant|Harry Bryant)) then took possession of it, along with Nebuchadnezzar's Crown, during a confrontation with Max. After Bryant dropped the Crown during the Lupus incident, the Sulphur glyph was discovered within one of the Crown's gemstones, and was destroyed by ((NPCMerlin|Lin Huntington)).

It was later learned that destroying the glyphs merely unbound that portion of the Occultem Lapidem's power, making it more difficult to control. Sulphur hid in the Crown until the day of the Deus rite, when (along with ((NPCSalt|Salt))) it tried to leap into the ((NPCOversoul|Oversoul)) just as ((NPCCain|Cain)) consumed it. Huntington stopped them, however, by trapping them in a wall of force and then sealing them into the empty onyx stone formerly housing the Oversoul.
