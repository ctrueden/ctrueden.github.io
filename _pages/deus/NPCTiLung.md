-=Ti-Lung=-

Ti-Lung is a gold dragon from the planet of Dragonstar. Nearly 300 years ago, she abandoned everything she cared about (including her mate ((NPCShenLung|Shen-Lung))) to travel to Earth, seeking to discover the source of a strange power there. In the Pax Artificium era, she became [/pax/npcs/bishop.html|John Bishop's] protector, was perverted into a dracolich by the Rex wraith, was later destroyed during the final confrontation in the Garden, and her tainted soul was cast into the sun for purification. Over 250 years later, she has returned somehow in the form of a young man called ((CharPublicJames|Zee)).
