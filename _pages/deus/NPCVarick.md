-=Varick Rixmann=-

Varick is the father of Siegfried Rixmann (a.k.a. ((CharPublicJames|Zee))), and husband of ((NPCElsa|Elsa)). He and his wife went into hiding before Zee was born to prevent further experimentation on him by Varick's ex-employer, ((OrgStratCo|StratCo)).

Varick is descended from [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/rixmann.html|Ingolf Rixmann], an NPC from Pax Artificium.
