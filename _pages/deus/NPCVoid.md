The term &quot;Void&quot; has been used to describe both an omnipresent nothingness and a physical presence of some sort, responsible for the disappearance of the Percepi colony, which shall be called the [Destroyer](NPCDestroyer) for the sake of clarity.

Many theories have been put forward by those with some connection to the Void. [Noun](CharPublicLucas) has claimed that the Void is seeking out areas with high concentrations of mystic energy because the Void is the universe's way of restoring equilibrium, and mystic energy represents a disruption of that equilibrium. [Nikolai](CharPublicJon), who possesses certain Void-related powers, claims that the Void is attempting to destroy psionic intelligences that could potentially &quot;go bad&quot; somehow. However, no one knows for sure what the Void is, or what its true motivations are, if any.
