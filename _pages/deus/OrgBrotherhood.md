The Brotherhood, founded by [Erik Lensherr](NPCLensherr), is a group of genetically modified humans and other humanoid races who believe in genetic alteration and experimentation as the future of humankind. Members possess varying levels of militance: some claim they are simply superior to humans in every way, while others maintain only that members dubbed &quot;genetic rejects&quot; by society are not in fact inferior to &quot;normal&quot; humans.
