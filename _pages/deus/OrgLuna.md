-=The New Lunar Order=-

The New Lunar Order is a splinter group of ((OrgGaia|Gaia's Ancient Order)), consisting of Gaians who believe that ((NPCLuna|Luna)) should be allowed to make her own choices regarding her fate, rather than being forced against her will to undergo a procedure that will fundamentally alter her nature. Prior to ((NPCCain|Cain's)) corruption of ((NPCNyx|Everlily Nyx)), the fierce pixie led the New Lunar Order initiative, despite the fact that it destroyed her personal life with ((NPCMoss|William Moss)), who supported the ((NPCCaretaker|Caretaker's)) efforts.
