-=Magitech Corporation=-

After [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/groups/magitech.html|Magitech] was banned from operating on Earth and ((NPCMoss|William Moss)) and ((NPCNyx|Everlily Nyx)) disappeared from the public view, control of the company passed to [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/sara.html|Sara Cassenti's] young twins ((NPCEvan|Evan)) and ((NPCAdana|Adana)) Cassenti. Since then, the company has concentrated mainly on lunar services, striving to maintain Pax Artificium as the city with the highest standard of living in the galaxy. They have been instrumental in the design and construction of several key technologies that make the mystic colonies possible, including the mystic seeding devices and some components of the colonies' artificial atmospheres.

Relatively recently (nearly two decades ago), ((NPCEvan|Evan)) and ((NPCAdana|Adana)) went through a very ugly and highly publicized divorce. Since then, ((NPCEvan|Evan)) left Magitech and took a position in management at ((OrgStratCo|StratCo)), and soon rose to the position of CEO there. But Magitech and StratCo have been bitter rivals ever since.
