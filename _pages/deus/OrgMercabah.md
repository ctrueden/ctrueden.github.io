-=Mercabah Technologies=-

Mercabah is a tech brokerage, for the most part, that occasionally does its own R&amp;D, with a focus on &quot;natural&quot; or nature-friendly technology solutions. They were responsible for the radiation shielding that made the colonization of Mercury possible. Just as ((OrgMagitech|Magitech)) has a large presence on Luna, ((OrgStratCo|StratCo)) has a large presence in Europe and Antarctica, and Midgard is the major power in Asia, Mercabah essentially owned Mercury... until the incident. Now Mercabah's Mercury division has folded, and the stock price of Mercabah's Earth division has plummeted as the company holds on by a thread.
