The WMG was formed shortly after the conclusion of [World War III](Timeline), fueled by the fact that mystics had been responsible for the safe end to the war (but also largely for its instigation). [Moses Morningbird](NPCMoses) (aka &quot;Speed Demon&quot;), the hero of WW3, was offered the opportunity to lead the WMG but declined, stating that he had no interest in such political pursuits, as well as denying that he was a mystic. However, other members of his team took head positions -- most notably [Lefty](NPCLefty) becoming president -- and his wife [Anna Morningbird](NPCAnna) was also active in its affairs for years to come.

Today, the WMG manages the employment of mystics, including overseeing mysticport operations and fair treatment of its members.
