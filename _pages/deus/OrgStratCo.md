-=Strategic Improvements Corporation=-

After the death of [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/groups/stratco.html|StratCo's] R&amp;D head [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/rixmann.html|Ingolf Rixmann], StratCo redirected its efforts toward genetics, with much success. StratCo HQ is still located in Europe, but has expanded to the galactic market, with branches on all the major colonies, with their largest presence in Glacialis (Antarctica), a city for whose creation they are largely responsible. They do not have an office in Pax Artificium on Luna, however. [http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/bishop.html|John Bishop], StratCo's founder, is long dead, and the company has changed hands a number of times. The company is currently managed by a board of directors with over a dozen members, spearheaded by ((NPCEvan|Evan Cassenti)).
