!!!Character personality questionnaire

Answering the following specific questions will help you to flesh out your character. Please answer each one with a number between 1 and 5, inclusive. Feel free to provide additional comments if you think your answer to a particular question is misleading or needs further clarification. And remember: there is no requirement for your character to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; -- such choices are entirely up to you.

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
#Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?
#Help a frail old woman cross the street?
#Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?
#Give money to a beggar on the street?
#Seek vengeance if wronged?
#Steal if he thought he could get away with it?

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
#Aliens?
#Karma?
#Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?
#Time travel?
#Equality for all sentient beings?
#God or other supreme force?

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
#Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.
#The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.
#Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.
#No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.
#Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications.
#Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day.
