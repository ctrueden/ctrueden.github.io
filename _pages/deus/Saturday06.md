Merlin Huntington is engineering a war between Lupus and Canis for revenge, but also to cause confusion so that he can steal the circlet. He had a hand somehow in Ocean's decision to sell the crown to the Volokhovs, maybe?

Zee was in custody on Lupus, alone with Huntington, who programmed Zee to bomb the mysticport. The man with the mask is an Illusion Huntington uses for various purposes.

The name Zebadiah Schinder really is Zee's name. But the ID card is a fake created by Huntington to mystically track him.

Huntington told Khan that he used Zee to accomplish the mysticport bombing.

The party sees Huntington on Canis entering a warehouse. If they spy on him, they see that he is locating and disarming some technology -- maybe bombs, or pieces of them. He is destroying them as they are ported in.

If they talk to him, he explains that he's probably going to lose his position with Khan for this, but that he has to stop more innocent people from being killed. He knows the rumors about Canis stockpiling antimatter bombs are false, and just an excuse for Khan to attack. (Of course, all of this is lies to get them to trust him.) Huntington means to prove it by infiltrating the enemy bunkers.

Why did Huntington disable Canis's mysticport? To sow chaos... and because he could have Zee do it for him.

Also, the Illusory man might &quot;attack&quot; Huntington and critically injure him.

One reason is if they thought weapons were being secretly stored there -- weapons that Khan was convinced were going to be used against him. But there were not -- Huntington told Khan there were, but he was lying. In actuality, Volokhov has been stockpiling weapons elsewhere, for use in retaliation in case Khan attacks.

Four bunkers, one each guarded by a Volokhov brother. All strong heroes.

Mikhael is guarding his collection. Specialties: Destruction and Displacement.

Stefan is guarding additional items from the collection. Specialties: Enhancement, Healing and Displacement.

Viktor is guarding sensitive documents. Specialties: Creation, Transmutation and Displacement.

Ivan is guarding military supplies, including antimatter bombs. Specialties: Pyrotechnics, Divination and Displacement.

Both Bryant and Cassenti want the crown. Once the party retrieves it, they both turn on the party. They both try to act reasonable but it's obvious they both really want it. Huntington protects them, and says it's enough that the crown is not in the hands of the Volokhovs, who were planning on using it as part of a weapon against Lupus.

From Saturday05:

Lin says he doesn't want anything in return, except to see the war that Khan started ended quickly, with a minimum loss of life. Too good to be true? Huntington is trying to insinuate himself so that the party willingly gives him the crown, instead of Bryant or Cassenti.

Bryant tells Max that he is very distrustful of Huntington, and that they are placing too much trust in him. But then Huntington has a talk with him, and Bryant has turned around, saying that Huntington can help them. (Huntington conveyed to Bryant that he was helping the Caretaker by managing this war, to increase the number of souls able to be harvested here, to speed the completion of the machine. The Crown must be recovered immediately, they agree.)

Anyway, in light of the attack on the mysticport, Volokhov has decided to move his collection from his mansion, where the items were on display, to a secret bunker somewhere in the city. The Volokhov brothers have set up several such bunkers, each warded against Displacement 20 (which four people each with Dis 10 can achieve by linking). However, only one such bunker contains Volokhov's collection. Another contains a number of antimatter bombs for use against Khan.
