Huntington learned to make the cursed crown from an ancient book writ by the infamous Baba Yaga. =)

In fact, the book has already appeared. When Saturday raided the bunker guarded by Ivan Volokhov, he was reading a book. Then, after Max invoked the Occultem Lapidem and everyone almost died and passed out, they awoke to find Huntington reading it.

No one really looked to see what it was. The book was in the Volokhov collection, to which Huntington had access, or was given access for the purposes of making that item. Actually, all five of them collaborated on the cursed crown. But the book is Huntington's now (he'll keep it).

See ((Talk20060115)) for more details on this session.
