!!!Canis and the Volokhovs

Matt/Ivan travels to Canis to attempt to contact the brothers, who are currently holed up in the remaining bunkers (Ivan knows where the three bunkers are), one of which has both Mikhael and Viktor but not Stefan.

Ground troops are landing in dropships when Matt shows up, so the surface of Canis is even more dangerous than usual.

During Matt's meeting with the Volokhovs, Coyote shows up to terrorize them, and uses phantasmal killer against Viktor to program him to betray his brothers. Coyote's appearance is supposed to look like a failed assassination attempt on Mikhael, but in reality Huntington wants the Volokhovs alive. Mikhael fights back, and together with Matt and Ivan they drive off Coyote.

Afterward, Viktor and Mikhael quiz Matt to prove that Ivan is really there. They are still suspicious, thinking maybe Matt absorbed Ivan's memories and is seeking to use them against him.

They likely attempt to take Matt into custody, to find out what he knows about Lupus's war plans. He probably needs to flee. If he somehow convinces them that Ivan is really inside him, the Volokhovs ask Matt to find a way to transfer Ivan to a soulmech body. In this case, they let Matt go, and say that if he is successful and Ivan returns to them, they will cancel the extradition request.


!!!Harry Bryant

If Saturday meets with Bryant, then Nikolai is dumped out of the Void, without any gear, in his true form, next to Harry Bryant. The Saturday group hears the Void echoes during a meeting with Bryant, and Nikolai's true form, sans gear, is dumped onto the floor.

Maybe the party tries to take the Crown back from Harry Bryant? But talking to him, it is obvious he is unwilling to return it. And if they try to take it by force, then he either kills them or flees, depending on the situation.


!!!Pipwhistle and the juice

Pipwhistle, a Smart character with three levels of mystic (Divination specialist) contacts them after a couple of weeks, because a divination reveals that they have knowledge of the juice's properties and origins. He is working on several of its applications, particularly with respect to necrophagia. But he is worried that it might be dangerous, and (without notifying the company) is doing some independent research to determine how dangerous the juice is, and what other properties it has.

One way the parties could meet is if Nald takes them to his lab, and the Monday group also ends up there for some reason (following a lead from Gaddelsmocks, maybe?). If Saturday does not talk to Bryant, then Nikolai could be ejected from the Void in Nald's lab, instead. (If Nikolai is exposed to the juice, it quickly ravages his form, killing him, since the Fearful fear the Void.)


!!!Miller prophecy emails

On July 12th, Vadril receives a &quot;fortune cookie&quot; giving him a clue about DEE: &quot;The awakened sigil of sword and crescent roams the celestial path of stones, holding the inspiration that you seek.&quot;

Bryant (the O.L.) receives a &quot;fortune cookie&quot; as well... The cookie the O.L. receives warns it about Huntington, something about how he is the one who will bind the O.L. to his will, and shatter its dream of being merged into Luna.

Thus, Bryant goes to kill Huntington to prevent the prophecy from coming to pass. If Saturday goes looking for Bryant, and finds him missing, they could track him to Huntington's location, and assist in his defense if they arrive during the fight. Otherwise, perhaps Huntington hurriedly contacts them requesting immediate help, since a man made of nanites is trying to kill him. Huntington might even port ''to'' the Saturday group for some reason.

If Nikolai has not yet appeared during the battle between Bryant and Huntington.


!!!Other stuff, for later

Dave's character does not show up yet. But he could be part of the Lupan army, ground troops in Canis. Or he could be a citizen of Canis, and defending his home from the Lupans.

Ned could also come to the Saturday group soliciting aid, although not this Saturday.

Huntington is selling arms to both sides in the war, to make lots of money. But his trading is not approved by the Syndicate...
