7:00 - OMG w3 4r3 5t1ll fu(|&lt;1ng 4r0u/\/d!!!!

7:10 - Allen talks DIRECTLY FROM his ass.  Curtis plays along for reasons unknown.  But not because he likes Allen.  Probably more out of pity.

7:11 - Curtis is 0n t3h 1nt4rw3b.

7:20:  Session Starts.

-Chaotic battlefield in wake of former fighting.  Brice is convulsing on the ground, Nikolai is in the void, Vito notes that despite Jasmine's apparent death he doesn't feel weaker.  Vito picks up werewolf and takes off with her toward Brice.  Arianna runs to Brice, begins attempting to play flute.  Plays for 3 rounds, but does not work.  Nikolai goes into void, can't convince it to stop trying to eat moon, comes back, wraps tentacle around Brice, prepares to leave.  Unity also nearby.  Unity, Nikolai and Brice teleport to the Grey Storm.  Nikolai then wraps tentacles around both and Void Steps to Lupus.

-Vito starts getting eaten by the Void.  Is unable to manifest mystic abilities.  Goes toward Adam, who freaks out at the sight of the black shadow woman creature werewolf.  Adam, Vito and the werewolf are teleported by Dee to the dreadnaught, and from there the entire ship teleports.

-Dee teleports them to an uninhabited star system.  Adam chills with his AI homies doing inspirational stuff, giving props, and other such tasks.  Vito feels overwhelmed by the events, and rests for a bit.  His chix0r is still unconscious.

-Ariana finds herself on Lupus alone.  On random street, seeing people but no one recognized.  Determines path to Merlin's compound.  Starts walking that way.  Sees hover droid coming up to her with package.  It stops in front of her, says &quot;Arianna Cassione?&quot;  She agrees.  He says there's a package, she asks from whom, it tells her who the package is from.  There is a letter from Rudolph and asks her to help him with some research.  The package itself is a box.  Droid thanks her for taking the package and hovers off.  She changes direction to nearest hostel/hotel/coffee shop/anyplace she can get a room to open the package.  She goes, gets there.  Discovers that G-net is unstable since all mystics are fleeing the system.  Obtains a room.  Sends note to parents making sure they got away.  Goes nearly hysterical about thoughts of going back to Earth, but could force herself to port there.  Opens a portal to her home, sees maelstrom of darkness, portal begins to bulge, immediately closes it.  Still seems to think it would be a good idea to go there.  Somehow.  And... does.

-Nikolai saw Arianna in the void, attempted to use a Time Duplicate to grab her in a tentacle before she was consumed, and ended up accidentally holding all three people, his awareness bent, and he got out of the void feeling like he was hit in the head by a 2x4, but with three people on the ground and two tentacles receeding into his arms.

-Adam is told about the Technofearful's attack on Leboro.  Described as a white substance consuming and integrating every machine and organic construct on the planet.  Dee frustrated, most disciples escaped, traveled to other worlds.  Dee expresses desire to go watch them and learn how to kill them.  Adam learns a significant amount about the Technofearful.

-Dee also talks about ship that attacked during rite.  Asks Adam to explore ship further and speak to it not only for redemption but to learn of origins and find out who it worked for and who deployed it.

-Vito gets lonely.  Crazy werewolf chick wakes up, doesn't go entirely crazy.  Looks gaunt, drawn, nervous.

-Jon feels urge to throw laptop at Joey for filling beard with pencils.

-Vito gets food for werewolf.  Griffin talks about Leboro.  Rest of party gnaws on Joey, become evil, takes over universe.

-Griffin gets t3h l0wd0wn about t3h T3chn0ph34rful and t3h 5h1p.

-Vito gets to know t3h W3r3w0lf chix0r (Mira).  She doesn't talk much.  Ain't too bright.  Conveys only simple concepts, but seems to not be afraid of him anymore.  On 10th day, Adam approaches and tells Vito he's leaving.  Mentions situation on Lupus which could go pretty bad.  Tells him white substance which ate Leboro headed for Lupus.  Additionally time/space is kinda messed up, and Dee is sending Adam to check it out.  Adam asks Dee to prepare greenhouse-type place with trees to simulate Lunar forest for Mira.

-Nikolai clutches his head on Lupus, Brice is unconscious, Arianna is clutching her head, and Unity is just kinda hangin' out, but feeling kinda dizzy, like he just woke up.  Not much happens for about five minutes.  Unity goes to walk off, and suddenly Adam is there with Vito.

-Discussion of nonsensical stuff occurs.

-People regain equilibrium.  Nikolai gives Brice some O.J.  People discuss the fact that they're missing 10 ****ING DAYS!!!!!

-OMGWTFLOLBBQ.

-People receive e-mail messages that they'd have been getting if Alex hadn't been eaten by the Void.

-News reports arrive.

-Discussion of situation on Lupus, Nikolai offers aid and is told by Merlin it is unnecessary.  Adam suggests that if the mystic energy is removed the Technofearful will not attack.  Decision is made by majority of party that evacuation is a good plan.

-Arianna opens a portal to her home on Luna.  Rest of party passes through.  Nikolai hops into Lupus, then hops to Luna, then hops to Earth and jumps out through Unity.  Arianna FINALLY opens her package.  Inside is a book.  Black with blue trim.  Seems faded.  On spine it says &quot;The blue rose.&quot;  Has a magical aura, clearly around entire book, protecting it.  Book is Arcane Locked.  She dissolves the lock, the book has a ribbon marking the page, page has a woman on it.  When she reads it, she's confused until she realizes it's a picture of her mother, caption reads Erica.  Pages flip, and she sees her own name, and then she feels herself being pulled into the book.  Then the book closes.  Brice does a search on The Blue Rose, gets to read a Wikipedia article.

-People discuss options, which mostly involves fucking around and not accomplishing anything.  

-Nikolai returns, reads the book, first chapter is about Baba Yaga, second is about Erica.  Erica started talking, discussiong how she got caught in the book.  

-Brice traces the book's travel back to Stratco, and the book is marked as a gift from Bernstein.  Tracks him back to his office, where he is working on 'the juice'.  Sends message to Bernstein saying that Arianna is in need of help and asking him if he'll help her out.  He asks what kind of trouble, and Brice explains.  He expresses that he knew nothing about this, and says he'd be willing to help.  Brice ignores anything resembling common sense or self-restraint and makes himself invisible, then hops out and grabs Bernstein.  He is immediately stricken with nausea and clubbed into unconsciousness by a Mithril golem.

-Brice awakens groggy, strapped to a table, with a man in a labcoat over him (Holden Veiner).  The man says that he's awake, and is clapping things like scalpels together and saying that he wants to figure out more about him.  Question-and-answer session begins, and then Brice vanishes into cyberspace.  He watches Holden failing to find him in the lab, then goes back to Bernstein and asks to meet him outside.  Bernstein asks the party to come to him with clearance.  Brice tells him to go to her apartment, and he ports there.

-Bernstein shows up.  Discussion ensues relating to the probability that Arianna had been set up by Bernstein's superior.  Bernstein finds an Arcane Mark &quot;V.W.&quot; in Elven, which corresponds to Vondre Willowtree.

-People go to Brice's apartment.  Allen freaks out from sensory overload.  People want information from Div. questions.  Brice goes looking for Vondre.  Finds her.  Discovers that she's weaker than Arianna but stronger than Bernstein.  Brice gets the book.  Opens it to the page that has her name on it.  Sets it down on the table in front of Vondre, and sucks her into it.

-Nikolai wakes up after Brice comes back, lets Unity out, and the two of them bicker about the fact that Nikolai put Unity into the void while he was napping.

-Description of Vondre's story.

-10 minutes pass and Vondre starts yelling at party.  Claims she doesn't know how to get us out, and that page with that information was stolen.  Argument ensues, and people decide that we need to get her to tell us how to break the curse.  Discussion ensues with Bernstein.  Party decides that talking to Erica is necessary, and asks her to do another divination about who took the page.  Nald Pipwhistle stole the page.

-Brice finds Nald on the grounds of Eric Lencher of the Brotherhood, looking at the criminal record of Devlin Gasomethinorother.  Puts message on his screen saying that Vondre needs his help.  Nald freaks out.  Brice asks for location of page.  Nald says he can't trust her, and refuses to give her page.  Brice shows playback of Vondre in book.  Argument ensues.  Brice explains Vondre's actions with book, and tries to convince him to help.  Establishes permanent connection.  Nald attempts to shut him out, but Brice maintains access.  Nald tells Brice that he'll tell Brice what was on the page if Brice agrees to bail his mother, Devlin.  Brice unfreezes one of Nald's accounts and posts bail for her.  Nald tells rules of book as he remembers.  1:  Put name in, captures.  2:  If you let the book sit open, they can do stuff.  3:  If you say their names three times, they'll be free.

-Nald tells Brice that he was fired because he didn't like the way they were using his research, and said he was fired also for being a Brotherhood spy.  Which he was.  

-Erica is freed.  Nikolai picks up the book.

-Brice keeps talking to Nald.  Devlin is in jail on Luna.  Nald goes to Devlin at the jail and gets his ears talked off.  Brice and Nald call it good.  Nald sends Brice a top-secret file &quot;Super Ultimate Top Secret Classified information on the qualities of a white goo (insert bunches of other crap)&quot; aka &quot;Properties of the juice.&quot;

-Information disseminated.

-Nikolai goes to put the book into the void, but the echoes are louder than usual, and he hears his name.  When he puts the tentacle in he hears that the Destroyer moves.

-Book is to be handed over to Adona.  Adona agrees to take custody of the book, and is angry about the fact that the elves are infighting again.  Ariana agrees to take book to Adona, and Arianna goes to port.  Book resists her, and she cancels the port.  Bullshit infighting happens, Brice cancels Dim. Anchor, Arianna tries porting again, and gets there.

-Arianna talks with Adona for awhile about Void stuff and the book.  Adona invites the party to discuss things with her and give information about tasks that could be done to help the city.  Arianna sends message to Adam expressing invitation to go to her.  Adona tells us we should show up in half an hour.

-Vito goes to the heart tree, talks to gaians.

-Arianna attempts to contact Baba Yaga.  For the third time tonight, she manages to do something incredibly bad  when separated from the rest of the party.  She attempts to deceive Baba Yaga.  Baba Yaga isn't taken in, and promises her to do whatever she wants, including a wish, if she frees her.

-Nikolai enters the void.  He hears a message from Jasmine telling him that he can get her out of the void by using the Deus Ex Machina, the Archway.  When he appears there, he sees the three figures, and unconsciously pulls out his tentacles and attempts to grab the archway.

-Brice feels the call of the Node from which he spoke to Adona.  He sees Nikolai's appearance, and sees two other figures.  One a skinny man in overalls with stubble and saggy jowls with a sad expression on his face, and the other is half his height, a gnome woman in a white robe.  (Joe and Miara.)

Joe says &quot;A portal will open to Reality's End.&quot;  Miara says &quot;It is not fated that you will open the portal, but you are the portal.&quot;  Joe tells him he's faced with a terrible choice.  You can either end your life or become the means for the universe's destruction.  Brice is faced with the choice.  He sees Nikolai pull Jasmine through the archway, veiled in dark energy.  She says &quot;Thank you.  Now we can open it.  We can send the destroyer away.&quot;  She begins channeling dark energies, and Nikolai does the same.  Brice feels himself drawn toward the center of the archway, and his body is stretched.  He allows himself to be drawn to the node, and he is transformed to fill the archway into a white portal.  And all of reality collapses.
