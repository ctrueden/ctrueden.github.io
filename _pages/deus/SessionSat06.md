Sunday, June 25th, 2299: At Matt's apartment, ((NPCAdana|Adana Cassenti)) sends sensor data illustrating Cain's recovery from Magitech HQ, and subsequent expulsion from Luna.

Several people are observed carrying a large, reinforced stasis chamber out of HQ, loading it into a large van, and transporting it into the arboretum in Pax Artificium. They stop at a very large tree, and suddenly appear very alert. They are confronted by a ((NPCNyx|red-haired pixie)) wielding a rapier who tells them that ((NPCMoss|William Moss)) must not be allowed to proceed. One of the people pushes two knots on the tree and a door opens. The pixie immediately darts inside. All but two of the others follow.

After a short time, the sky darkens and a giant bolt of lightning strikes the tree, rending it asunder. Shortly afterward, a ((NPCCain|thin, nearly skeletal man)) flies upwards out of the tree's innards, with the red-haired pixie clinging to his arm for dear life. As they are flung higher and higher into the air, they begin to catch fire from the atmospheric friction, and the feed ends.

Matt volunteers the party's continuing services to Magitech, and Cassenti says they could try to locate a crown that was recently stolen from them. She says it was a team led by a thief named ((NPCOcean|Daniel Ocean)) who stole it, but declines to reveal how he did so. She says only that he took advantage of a temporary weakness in Magitech's security. She says she does not know who hired him, but speculates that ((NPCBryant|Bryant)) did.

Korlax researches Ocean's last known location, and finds that he is &quot;independently wealthy,&quot; lives in Glacialis, and often travels. Korlax then hacks into the mysticport records and determines Ocean's last recorded transport was to Canis 16 days ago.

Meanwhile, Max continues speaking to Bryant about private matters mentally while Rae waits impatiently, fidgeting.

Eventually, the party agrees to travel to Canis and attempt to locate the Crown, but they still haven't decided what they are going to do with it, if anything.

The party spends the rest of the day shopping! *girlish giggle* They stock up on supplies, weapons, armor and cybernetic enhancements.

That night, Max visits Israel to see his father. He also has a talk with the O.L. about private matters.

Max reinjects himself with the white fluid. It quickly devours the Divination ward around him, and he regains some energy from it somehow.

Monday, June 26th, morning: The party is prepared to leave, and has arranged for mystic transport to Canis. A perky middle-aged woman (Shiela Lewis) tells them the destination is the Walmart parking lot in Canis.

On Canis, it is just before dawn. The party decides to travel to the ((NPCVolokhov|Volokhov)) mansion and ask the brothers directly whether they have the Crown, and if so why, and maybe whether they might want to hand it over.

The doctor acquires the blueprints for the mansion, and also determines that there are electronic cameras monitoring the grounds, which is fenced off. Matt decides to make a pass around the perimeter. When he reaches one side of the manor, he sees the gate is ajar, but swinging shut. With his heads-up display he notices a figure slipping through the corresponding door to the mansion. Moving closer with his HUD's x-ray ability, he observes ((NPCMerlin|Lin Huntington)) kneeling near the edge of an ornate table, fiddling with a large metalic box of some sort that looks suspiciously like a bomb...
