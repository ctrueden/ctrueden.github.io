Session started at 2:46 pm on 12/3/05

Attending players: Nate, Eva, John, James, Lucas

Presiding GM: Curtis

Major NPC's: some of the Volokhov brothers, Merlin Huntington

So we are outside the Volokhov mansion. I do not know about this plan, but hopefully the leaders of this world will be willing to talk.

Matt sends me a picture of Merlin Huntington messing around with a big metal box on the grounds. I am just telling Z that I am going to go see what Matt is freaking out about, but as Max slips through the gate alarms start going off. Stupid, grrrr...

(&quot;I was looking for a bomb, but it should be safe now...&quot; ~Merlin)

(&quot;He puts his hand on your shoulder, Don't resist.'&quot;
~ Curtis, speaking as Merlin
&quot;Fine, I don't resist.&quot;
~ John
&quot;He disintegrates you!&quot;
~ Curtis
&quot;Noooooooo!&quot;
~ John)

Suddenly Matt and Merlin appear. I suggest that we should probably flee before the authorities show up. We all pile into the car and retreat.

Merlin tells us that the General has escalated the conflict between Lupus and Canus. It sounds like Canus is going to be toast if Merlin was not interfering.

It sounds like Merlin is trying to do what is best for both Canus and Lupus, but it does not sound like there is much chance to stop the deranged general. We are discussing our next step when Z's eyes roll back in his head and he says in a strange voice that &quot;The mansion is empty of valuables. The crown is far away in a bunker being held by one of the brothers.&quot; Well, that is good to know I guess.

Merlin wants to get proof that the brothers are not keeping weapons of mass destruction in their four bunkers. He offers to temporarily ally with us since we will need to investigate the bunkers as well.

Merlin thinks that all four bunkers will be very well guarded, but as we have no idea what is in any of them, we might as well head to one more or less at random.

Suddenly the car begins to slow down and sink towards the ground. Two large black vehicles are closing in on our van. I point out that we had better leave now. I teleport over to the hotel we were staying at last time we were out here.

(Meanwhile, Matt has hacked the car to get the doors to unlock, everyone piles out and Matt sends the van barreling into one of the black vehicles. The other is still undamaged... The doctor tells folk he will meet back up with them and teleports away.... everyone else has a crazy fleeing scene... there is a dog... Z gets hit by a gravidic rail gun, for a lot of damage... eventually Merlin ends the chaos by grabbing folks and teleports them away...)

When I appear back in a dark corner of the hotel lobby I notice that there is a wispy form standing about 6 feet in front of me. This very strange man and his very strange robot spider thing are here now. I am not sure how that happened. It seems like they were here, but they were not.

Anyway, they say that they were looking for me. The robot introduces them as Noun and Pronoun. The robot thing is Pronoun. Apparently the man does not talk. They say that they were looking for me because I am a dragon! Erg...

Pronoun claims that they have been to Glaurung and that Glaurung it self spoke to them! They are carrying some sort of information about how the world and time work and something about how it connects to &quot;The Void&quot;. I think he means the Beast, in some form. Pronoun says that they were both on Percepie when it was consumed. He says that two other people survived as well and that they managed to escape through a statue that Noun had built that was some sort of gateway through space and time.

One of the two of them sends me some information about how he/they think the world works. My computer is displaying a whole lot of symbols and equations that I can not make heads or tails of. Perhaps the doctor or Z will have more insight. Pronoun seems a bit disappointed that I do not understand but he suggests that we could talk about it in a few millennia. I suppose if I am still alive at that point I might a better perspective on complex math...

It has been at least ten minutes and I think I should meet up with the others. I email them and ask them to meet me in the park. A minute or two later my computer starts beeping. It looks like Max has sent me an email saying in the park... well in the park or parked? That does not make sense, so I am going to assume he is in the park.

It crosses my mind that my face will be recognizable if they had surveillance around the mansion, so I take the time to alter my illusion to look like a different person.

Pronoun and Noun would like to meet my friends, so we head over to the park. For some reason they feel rather trustworthy to me. I am a little disturbed that they are not raising more alarms in my head, but for now I will just pay close attention to what they do.

Pronoun has a few interesting things to say about his friends and what they have been doing. He seems very strange. I get the feeling whoever &quot;made&quot; Noun an artist somehow broke his mind in a semi-good understanding the universe sort of way.

We all meet up in the park. Everyone is magically disguised, but Max is still behaving like an idiot sometimes so they are pretty easy to identify. Pronoun calls a car for us and we head over to the first bunker.

Noun and Pronoun are willing to help us because their friends have been trying to stop Cane as well. Pronoun mentions something about being from the past but not being able to help against Cane unless he helps now. I never considered how confusing time travel would be before.

The first bunker is apparently under a laundromat. We head inside and look around. Matt seems to think that the restrooms are the way down. Max and Matt are trying to figure out how to get in. In the mean time Z and Pronoun and I talk about the Void and old dragon legends. I tell Pronoun the story of how the dragons came to live on Glaurung. Pronoun seems to think the story will be useful to his understanding of the Void. I am not so sure, but I still have very little idea of what he means at times.

It looks like Max and Matt have found a way down, so off we go! As we are heading down some metal stairs, I hear a muffled explosion below. Just as I manage to get down the stairs Z and Max are ported into each other by a man who must be one of the brothers. Z falls to the ground unconscious and Max suddenly explodes in a shower of nanites EVERYWHERE! Every thing goes black.

When I wake up, I am still in the bunker. There is no sign of the enemy mage, Max, or Matt, but the others are here. There is a pile of goo in the corner that I think is Max... and maybe the other missing people as well... not so good.

If Max ever does that again I am going to kill him.

Z seems to think that Matt and Max and the enemy mage are all in the goo. Not so great.

I start trying to open the lockers in order to find the crown, hopefully. The first one I knaw open has some glowing cylinders in it. Merlin says that they are anti-matter bombs. Not good. Noun has just opened a locker as well. Pronoun says that the crown is in there.

It is a huge ornate gold crown. I get it out of the display case and put it away in my backpack.

Noun sequesters him self in the locker the crown was in. Merlin thinks that we can teleport of here now if we need to, so we will just wait to see what Noun does...

Noun has brought Matt back somehow! But now Z is freaking out that the mage's aura is going into Matt! And Matt is twitching on the ground! What the hell is going on!

( I THINK I MAY HAVE MISSED A SMALL AMOUNT OF MATT DRAMA HERE, UNFORTUNATELY. )
