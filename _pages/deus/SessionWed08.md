Fey believes blowing up the heart tree on Mars is a potential dire threat should the conduit be open.  Someone could send a kamikaze run at the same time someone tree strides.  Harry Bryant wishes to go warn the caretaker of this impending threat.  Fey tries using detect thoughts and alignment on Harry Bryant, but he is protected by a magical ward.  Harry Bryant understanding Fey is doing, assures her he has the caretaker's best interest in mind.

The nature of Cain's magic is not well known; however he has not been in touch with reality so Fey feels he wouldn't be up on current events enough to know intricate details to be a threat in "this" way.  --Oz doesn't know what "this" is.

Ridge, Rossner, and Malcolm begin the search for the core on Perseverance starting from the heart tree spiraling out.  There is an invisible zombie near the heart tree watching the tree.  Malcolm put up a magical sensor about Trenton keep tabs on what's going on over there.

The rest discusses a number of things over 45 minutes.  The crown is examined by Noun and Trenton.  Noun finds no space/time anomalies with the crown, which he finds to be "bad".  Trenton touching the crown feels pain and sees blood running down Ariana's hands.  He doesn't believe the crown can be trusted.  Pronoun matter a fact states within two days Ariana is going to lose control of crown -- he's somewhat bluffing, but trying to see if he can create destiny.  Ariana shrugs this off ignoring his future telling.

Bryant is speaking with Ariana privately is planning to move to the caretaker immediately and then getting some object (the real circlet?).  Shortly afterwards, Mini V and Bryant leave to meet with the Caretaker (oz presumes using teleport).  Dr Peters asks to go, but folks have already left.

Nikoli shows Trenton "the weapon".  Trenton sees a crispy black energy around it.  After some discussion it is decided that "the weapon" will be carried by Nikoli to the meeting.  Ariana brings the crown.  Pete Moss buffs the Monday group with a series of warded mystic effects.

Ridge doing some research finds that there is another core in this city, but the military has already drained it as a precautionary measure.

In the sweep for the core, Malcolm sees Cain, two undead, and an invisible robot which has a dark sinister aura about it.  Malcolm sends warning to the group who will be meeting with him of the invisible 

Meechum and Bryce stay on DEE, while the rest leave on a shuttle to meet with Cain (including DEE in a droid).  The group (except for the droid) exits the shuttle at the open field of short grass where they are supposed to meet.  Cain in a thin gray robe flanked by two undead step out of forest to greet them.  Ariana senses two mystic auras on the henchmen and three on Cain.  Cain looks over and asks, "where is the one I spoke with?"   DEE tells Ariana to tell him he spoke to the ship's computer.  The droid exits the shuttle, saying this is his physical form.

Crazy Pete feels something strange.  Pete Moss yells that be on your guard that they are in the grass, everywhere.  Fey flies a little higher.  Nikoli flies a little higher off the ground.

Cain: You are clearly not trained warriors, why have you come here?

Tell your small friend to stop doing whatever he's doing.  (

Our initial purpose was to halt the attack on the colony.  We wish to dicuss more.  The awakening was a purposeful action by us.  We wish to offer you now what you would have received then.  

That being?  -&gt; Cain

Need to free colonists to places where they can port.

Already done.  -&gt; Cain

DEE works with the military to have folks ported (contact mystics on other planets and have them get here).  They must first be scanned for undead taint.

DEE says that Cain has moved his forces, but time is short.  DEE wants the military hardware to possibly continue the battle on the ground if it should continue.

Cain says, done, forces have been removed.

Ariana, Fey, Laiden, and Nikoli are in the air.

Wishes to offer Cain the same deal that was done with Gaia (caretaker).  Explaining that he would be merged with another mind, explaining it would increase his power.

Ariana jumps in saying that he would be turning everyone into undead.

DEE, says that they wish to save more and that all of humanity is in danger with the "WORLD DESTROYER".  Telling that the caretaker has given this information.

Cain says, Clever, assuming that this is true.  Cain is miffed by the automaton, thinking that isn't impressive.

DEE says this was Cain's choice there are others who are more than willing to jump in and talk.

Fey says this is the best way and benifiical to Cain as well.

Cain finds it interesting that the Caretaker would send such a motley crew.  

We say this is because of various unique abilities.  


We just found the antimatter, navigate to the underground, 

We navigate into the underground.  Malcolm goes blind, the core disappears.  Cain ends the meeting

A voice in Malcolm's mind says, return it now or you are doomed., the mind in contact is foul and evil.

We have the Earth Elementals ready to go, and we'll be ready in 24 seconds to phase it again as needed

The ship sensors are unreliable, some effects on the cavern has a magical effect from the walls.

One of the Zombies is the source of this confusion and is causing the sensors from not completely working.  A dispel magic on that zombie doesn't happen, almost corrupting Malcolm's mind.

Malcolm heads out to remove curse from Meecham.  Meecham begins to retch blood.  Bryce feeds Meecham with OJ.  

Perseverance goes and picks Everlily Nix.

Malcolm removes disease, which stabilizes Meecham.
