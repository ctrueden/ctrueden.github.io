An hour away from Luna the mad screams of the void ring in everyone's minds as the ship sensors show nothing.   Another half hour later the echoes begin to subside.  All are coping in their own way, deeply fundamentally disturbed.

At Luna, the Obsidian Teknocon docks on a UNF base.  Admiral Rosner greets us and quickly says that the call is not about the echoes, but something equally bad.  Dr Peters suffering from the echoes is being tended to.  We proceed to the briefing room.  While we were gone, the scenario planned by the caretaker has been put into play just a few hours earlier, however that is not the issue at hand.

Another threat from deep space doesn't seem related, but I don't believe in coincidences, A series of biological components, white viral substance and grey goo combination.  A full briefing will be given once all parties are present.  A group from Lupis will be attending as well, they should be there soon.

The threat has assimilated all of Laborro.  Everything is alive and computers function, but are infected and under the things control.  Next is Lupis, it seems to be spiraling to Earth.  The ship will be threaded and transported to Wolf 359.

Fey and Trenton port to the tree.  Told that folks are not allowed near the tree, but Fey thinks that she can get there.  They go (teleport) outside the forest first.  There are blackened patches of land everywhere.  Looks like building have been blasted (bombs from space) and almost like a riot.  The Magitech building is gone.  Four trolls immediately greet the two, mean nasty trolls.  Wut ooh want?

Fey introduces herself (connections to caretaker, etc) and says she wished to commune with the tree.

Nobody can go near the tree, powerful magics being channeled, too powerful for little pixies.  At Fey's prompting, the caretaker, the moon, and the big dragon are channeling all the power.

Fey is allowed in, but they tell Trenton to stay.  They work for the caretaker.  Fey vouches for Trenton and the let him in.  They try to port near the tree -- Trenton says to not get too close as they may interrupt at best, at worst destroyed by them.  They still try and are set some half a mile away.

They continue forward on "foot" (pixie flies) to the tree. After a couple thousand more feet (w/i 500 ft), a couple Pixies appear and say No one is suppose to go past here.  Fey conveys she was part of the group who helped do this, they take a peak around a corner and see an archway, with a royal with his hands on it absolutely still, and massive energies can be felt here.  The tree is covered with circuitry and energy is being taken from the tree flowing into the royal into the archway, and the archway is pointed outwards.  On the other side is a pale white girl with jet black hair channeling energy.

Across from them is IO, who is also channeling energy, all of this is shooting energy into space that keeps the void away.  This has been going on for the last 2 hours.

The little girl is called lillith.  It is confirmed this is Luna and Cain.  The pixies are sad since Luna didn't want to do this.  Fey says she trusted in the caretaker.  One of the pixies agrees.

Trenton thinks that Lillith is significantly less powerful than the others, but still overwhelmingly powerful.  

The machine makes the void attack somewhere else.  Fey leaves word she can contacted on Lupis as she has another mission to go on.

Ridge now has a full stock of 30 droids on her ship.



Saturday's group left the sphere of influence.  When Max's arm grows back, there is scar in place of the glyph on his hand.

Zee's parents eventually come to.

A digital message is sent asking that they return to the sphere of influence (for mystic energies).  Requesting that they land, and would like to stay where it is most secure, maybe Mr (Merlin) Huntington would know more.  

JP sends message Mr H to arrange for private quarters for Ms Consente and Zee and his guests.  Mr H has already made all the arrangements.  They are to head to the ???  There is a request for a meeting with the UNF about another threat.

Max tries to sense whether Mr H is under any influence, but can't seem to succeed as he is protected.  

Their ship (Huntington's ship- the Adept) is brought directly into the compound

The filthy mongrel get brought to the compound.

Zee agrees to something afterwards?  He says that the white substance may be a life saver -- literally.

The whole bunch of us are in the War room.  No places to sit, rather three kiosks.  

General Rosner (man with graying hair, with a lot of fairness and patience), Large metallic soulmech (General Khan), man in a robe with the hood over his head Merlin Huntington, Adam McCleen, woman with fine facial features (Adona Consente) a twin Evan Consente (dark circles and tired).

Fey -- albino pixie with red eyes
Laiden- 6'2" human, good looking unassuming
Trenton -- 6'1" human in good shape with eyes with an unnatural sheen
Noun-
Malcolm-
Max-human business suit, glasses, cologne, etc. Silverly tattoo- techno work-doppleganger

Matt Smith-shorter guy 5'8", easily forgotten.
Vidril Corlex-Royal, eyes piercing and green
Ridge-Robot with some human like faces
Adam McCleen-Human in a nice business suit -- terminator 3 guy
Zee-7'2" long blond hair, scales, claws, quarter gold dragon
Rey-eccentric 22 year old bag lady that doesn't fit in, she is a small white dragon

Max is reading General Khan's mind-filled with worry and fear, running over and over in his mind that antimatter weapons won't work.  They say they won't work, but I don't believe them.  

Khan says there is no net access here for security reasons.

Admiral Rosner gives the briefing.  You have all proven yourselves trustworthy over time, no agreements will be needed (non disclosure agreement).  We are calling them the aliens for now since we don't have a better name.

Holographic imagery of some planet, some metamorphosis has happened.  Attacked by some rat/bear thing.  Monkey like creatures (cross breed), stare out with malice.  The doctor tries to make friends and they bite.  The monkey eyes are white, the others have this.  It is asome infection, with this he can hear voices and it tells him to go the jungle.  They get to a mountain after a while, there is a village.  A woman with the white in her eyes greet them (stone age look).

The communicate somehow and meet everyone in the village.  Everyone agreed to be infected.  These people appear human, but infected (and primitive).  The planet has been moving to avoid the peacemaker.  They have been on the run for a long time.

Zee had a nightmare, his hut caught flame.  They accused him of being a tainted one.

Mr Max had some ability that disabled a whole bunch of people.  

They have militarized and are attacking.  They accused Zee of bringing the Peacemaker upon us.  After that being are transported to the world of the dragons, and we stop.

The ecosystems leave the world in organic shifting bubbles that continually rebuilds itself.  The living planet stays where it is at.  It moves faster than light.

It moves differently now, more efficiently.

Huntington says they were exposed recently, how is not important.  We have samples of the white and grey goo, that likes to absorbs magic.  It is biologically connected substance.  

Holographic imagery, Laborro's skies darken as these blobs come. Giant balls of water smash and coats everything, it crawls to everyone and infects them with milky white eyes with circuitry.

They got rid of it with healing and destruction.  Magic partially enhances them.

They are still under getting their research back.  The substance was discovered on Earth during an archeological dig about three years ago in Northern Africa -- it was present until 6500 BC -- about the time emanual arrived.

The caretaker has not been contacted recently as it is very busy.  It is possible to have the caretaker redirect the weapon, but must convince Eddie to move.  Virgil will look into it.

Antimatter worked well the first time, but they adapted.  They've contacted Mercaba, apparently all the information on that project was lost.  If Mr Cohen or Mr McClean knows of a backup source???  

MrClean provides the grey goo tech sheet.  Behavior evident on Mercury was due to a predominantly mystic effect-but withholding significant information.  It is mostly technical, but has one section with "Magic black boxes".

Note added that replication can be done quickly with occultin lapitum.  Sealing the power with glyphs and then use mystic energies to control them.  This allows growth faster than he could even dream of.

Merlin says occultin lapitum did survive as a black stone, that housed the oversoul, during the days.Ms Consente gave her the stone.  It was manufactured by the caretaker himself or someone in his employ.

Stone is Onyx smooth, with two lights inside (yellow and white).  The light are two aspects of occultin lapitum (there are three needed) trying to find a way out.  The third needed is a project that he and Mr Cohen will be researching.

Recreate the alien life form.

Those fireflies have a will of its own.  The yellow light is the one they are concerned about.

What was used to disable the entire planet since it was mentally joined.  

The ambrosia they used is unlikely to be ever found again.  McClean says there were also some side effects which can be discussed later.

Thoughts that the strength of the hive mind might be stronger by size.

Resistance to magic doesn't work except for destruction magic.  Twice as much energy is needed.  Could a number of mystics work piece meal?  Unlikely that it can be destroyed while in space.

Mr Huntington used mundane destruction on white and grey goo not as adapted with each other.

Portation effects have been tried and fails.

EMP disrupted the area hit.  The second time seemed ineffective.

Don't why it is attacking us?

Possible motives, purging the taint (magic) now? -&gt; postulates Max.  McClean doesn't want to assume anything? 

Psionic was used to set the hut on fire.  In principle Consente says they are basically the same.  It is eliminating mystic magic, so the void has no interest.

The void is being distracted with a psionic pulse.

Dancing Cat and Rey talking about various things.  The Peacemaker came up, it was stated that they had been running from this tainted world.  Their homework had been tainted and the peacemaker would come back to bring everything back into equilibrium.. They left to avoid the reckoning.  

We think throwing magic is bad.  There is some mystic aspects in the nanites control.  Grey goo are not complex enough.

The white goo might be substituting itself as an OL?

To fix the OL the aspect from Mercury is needed??

Evan Consente offers some information, but state this must stay in this room.    He looks very tired, when we found the white substances, we realized it could provide us with more information.  It led to what happened on Luna.  I established a research program to stop the caretaker's plan (three years ago).  I assigned my top scientist to learn more about this white substance.  It quickly became clear it would be crucial in the operation of ships that drained away and disposed of mystic energy.  A beam would massively drain the energy away.

That is what was used against Luna.  The prototype was disabled and captured by Dee (fifth generation).  The fourth is still around.  The key researcher survived.  

Theoretically it just drains energy.  

There are plans to evaculate Lupis.

What about Cain, the backlash might act as a poison.  

We have nanites contaminated with the grey goo -- we can try poisoning it.

Are the nanites breaking down materials in the video, the answer is yes.  Using it to create new things.  

Three distinct plans:
Fix the OL -- McClean, Max
Noun communicate with it -- Malcolm, Noun
Experiment with backlash -- Trenton, Laiden, Fey
Drain away the mystic energy  - Ridge, Evan (have a seed in reserve)
Guide the destroyer on the planet -- Zee talking with Eddie

Consult Caretaker about all five plans - Vidril


Matt in reserve



There is mystic energy on the sun, but not in the typical sense.  It has interesting properties anywhere else.  Difficult to explain, you don't want to do the same.  He's not part of the oversoul, he escaped into what he is now.

Zuul, thinking a soul vaccum, with Matt.

Lots of separate discussions going on.

Ambrosia from the sun, that was used to cure Harry Bryant.

Matt offers that he absorbs disembodied souls.  This is a way to recover souls.  


===================
Fixing the OL
Mercury Shard -- Max believes he has part of its essence.  Either the person with the arm or himself???   Using divination they find the arm and what happened to it.  It is not accessible, but that is not relevant.  They learned it is out of their reach.  They spin into truth sensing, and they determine that the OL has integrated itself with Max.  They believe it might be lethal to Max to extract it, and Max seems willing to try.  Huntington draws out the OL in Max.  It is cold.  Max buffs his stats.

Max is starting to disappear as Huntington divs on him, pushing him close to disappearing

===================
Ridge researching
Evan Consente and Ridge think about how it can do FTL jumps.  It uses miller 2 algorithm.  On Earth he meets Sagitarius (Soul mech) and is excited about talking about Miller 2.  This is how he got away from Mercury.  

It uses virus of the white goo to fuel itself, and then consumes it to stop it from growing too much and excretes the dead white goo.

They start talking about outfitting another ship.  They plan up to upgrade.

===================
Soemthing about Laiden's past
Adona uses div and mind control to read Laiden's mind.  This man is not familiar looking into Laiden's mind.  Laiden doesn't think this makes any sense.  It doesn't make sense with what Laiden knows.  She is the first of his people and this person would older than her.  

Possible he was masquerading as one of us.  Or a spirit?

He worked for the company for 150 years, which is puzzling.  He had knowledge of psionics, which is closely guarded.  It is a mystery they can continue to investigate.

Adona is angry about all sort of things that has been going on.  And not knowing who this is just drives her crazy.  A doppelganger?  Doesn't make sense that everyone at the company forgot who this was?

===================
Discussion on Serra
Laiden are you okay?  Laiden feels odd as he just learns that Zee is his mom?  Serra talked with Joshua.  Joshua (central computer) says he has escaped Laborro.  It asked if I was interested in enlightenment.  This is first machine that has offered such a thing.  She asks Laiden whether this is okay.  She feels the flaw in her LORE chip prevents some of this.  According to that computer this would free me of that burden and free me of having to serve you and am a bit reluctant, and yet intrigued.  It may allow me to serve better.

We could go after the ones that exploit the weakness.  The caretaker has admitted that he was responsible.  The royals can probably crack the weakness and they may not be willing.  Even if they are not, they may not help.  Serra wishes to follow up on this, Laiden says "I hope we can still be friends".  

Serra pauses for ten minutes.  She says, I think I understand now.  This was probably for the best, but I won't know for sure for a while; still my confidence that the previous weakness is eliminated.  I'm still trying to understand how this works, Joshua has explained it.

Serra shares her theory a maelstrom of larger plans are in play.  Everything that has happened to Laiden stems from Dr Bailen.  Hired, access to this ship, survival on Mercury....  Now you've met all these people with unique abilities.

Serra has existential Anghst.

====================
Research into backlash
They look into the backlash on the substance.  It slows its ability to absorb the magic.   It does absorb it, but does not multiply.

Destruction seems to effect, so do other types of magic.

====================
Max is healed until he disappears.  The healing has some binding effect?  Max becomes a glowing grey dot of light and is put into the stone.  They believe they can complete the OL and release Mr Cohens afterwards.

Max consumes the other two and now the OL glows with a grey light.

====================
Talking to Caretaker
Not so much, instead Vidril needs to talk with the Gaians.  Talk to Alphadeer (leader of the Royal).

Alphadeer can at least pull the resources of the Royals.  Vidral looks into that, but can not contact him as he is fully busy.

Vidral has an audience granted immediately with another important person?  Greeted by a young gnome who is pensive.  She was just about to contact you and your friends.  Someone under my command has suffered an incident.  Max Cohen has undergone significant magical changes.  Lots of mind control on him and then something extremely weird has happened.  He believes they succeeded, and she wants to go with Vidral now.

Zella offers to send Garrald to defeat them, but probably not.  Maybe lead the aliens to somewhere like Pluto.

A few people are moving to create a seed to reseed laborro if possible.

They go to the base on Lupis.  Zella like the destroyer plan as it is final.  Talking to Eddie doesn't seem possible.   Zella asks are you feeling adventurous?  I don't care if we save Lupis, but the removing of mystic energy should work.

Matt walks in and here's the last bit of the conversation.  She says she is Anastatia.  She says there is a research lab down this hall and the door is locked, but she opens the door anyway using lots of destruction on the door.

She looks and says, there you are (looking to the OL).  Zella asks that Max agreed to this himself?  Huntington says he did, and Zella frowns asking whether this works.  Zella asserts herself into this and is now working on the project.

Max wants out, but Huntington doesn't believe it would be safe to let him out, whether he could stay in control of himself.

When Huntington commands Max, Max does something slightly different.  Huntington pauses after hearing that Max is testing what he can do for himself.

============r========
Evan Consente meeting up with Matt wants to know what happen to Zee.  


Zee talks to his parents. His father explains he was a researcher at stratco (Dr Veener) looking into what happen to John Bishop.  Ricksman's child was bombarded with lots of magic.  Elsa and he ran away so they couldn't experiment on you (Zee).

You are not psionic, another kind of mystic.  It would take a lifetime to use it up.

Miller 2 seems to protect Laiden, they take some of the substance (on Laborro).  


Zuul and Matt allow them to extend the range of his net to 20 feet and it can't be dialed down.  Tinkering it more, it is now 25 feet.

====================
She used Noj and Citric to make the first royals, says Zella.  

Zella plans to fix Max later.  



Backlash is working better and the combination of the goos makes it even better.

====================
Malcolm talks stretching himself to talk with the techo-fearful.  Telling them about the voids being diverted.  They get anger and split to have half go toward SOL and half to Lupis.
