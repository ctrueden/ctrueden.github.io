This page contains information about the mechanics of the campaign, including the merit point system used for character creation and advancement:

We are using the [d20 Modern](http://www.12tomidnight.com/d20modernsrd/Home.php) and [d20 Future](http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=products/d20m/885970000) books for the campaign. Some elements are drawn from [Dragonstar](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/dragonstar.html) but please ask before using anything from that setting or from [Dungeons and Dragons](http://wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome).

Resources:

You are encouraged to read the d20 Future SRD for ideas and inspiration, but please ask before using any of the chapters to customize your character. For example:
* __Robots:__ I am not using the biodroid/bioreplica rules for playing an android. Rather, create your character using the merit system. It might make sense for a robot to require no food, but if you do not take the &quot;No need to eat&quot; merit, it still requires some alternative form of regular energy replenishment such as new batteries or plugging into a recharge socket. The exact details depend on your character concept, but the idea is to preserve game balance between organic and machine-based characters.
* __Mutations:__ I am not using the mutation rules, but the mutations listed can serve as a good example of the sorts of things possible with the merit system. Some of the mutations may translate point-per-point (or close) into merit point costs, but please ask before assuming things cost exactly what is listed in the book. As a rule, the merit costs listed on this site overrule the mutation costs from the d20 Future book.

Those of you in Pax Artificium may recall there were some d20 house rules for that campaign. Most of these rules are not in effect for Deus Ultionis:
* __Initiative:__ We are using the normal d20 initiative system (not d12).
* __New skills:__ Spot and Listen have been combined into a single skill, &quot;Senses,&quot; which applies to all sensory modalities. Move Silently and Hide have been combined into a single skill, &quot;Stealth,&quot; which encapsulates the fine art of not being sensed by any means. Buying ranks in Senses and Stealth is allowed as usual (and there is no Improved Alertness feat).
* __Skill ranks:__ The usual skill rank maximums are in effect. However, in addition to the Skill Focus feat, players may also purchase the Improved Skill Focus feat, which grants an additional +1 to a skill and stacks with itself. Lastly, bonuses accrued from Skill Focus and Improved Skill Focus count toward the prerequisites for feats and advanced classes.
* __Vitality:__ Instead of HP, I am using the [Star Wars d20](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=starwars) Vitality system. Compute your &quot;hit points&quot; normally, but realize those are actually your &quot;vitality points.&quot; You also have a set number of &quot;wound points&quot; equal to your Constitution, which does not change as level increases. The Toughness feat increases wound points, not vitality points.
* __Wealth:__ Everyone gets to &quot;take 8&quot; on initial Wealth score. In addition, if you have any specific &quot;expensive&quot; items written into your backstory, you start with those with no penalty to your Wealth bonus (within reason -- mystic items are so rare that they must be purchased with merit points). But any additional items you require beyond those from your backstory you must purchase according to the normal rules.

Other house rules, GM rulings and clarifications:
* __Death and dying:__ I am introducing one new kind of damage: lethal. Any damage taken after 0 wounds are reached counts as lethal damage. Lethal damage imposes a penalty to all Fortitude saves equal to the amount of lethal damage accumulated.
* __Plus feats:__ The d20 Future feats Strong Plus, Fast Plus, Tough Plus, Smart Plus, Dedicated Plus and Charismatic Plus work differently. The prerequisite is at least two of the relevant base class's talents. The benefit is one additional talent from that base class for which you qualify.
* __Robust:__ This Tough talent grants +1 wound point per Tough level.
* __Second Wind:__ This Tough talent restores a number of vitality points equal to your Tough level plus your Constitution modifier, when an action point is spent.
* __Stamina:__ This Tough talent causes both wounds and vitality to recover twice as quickly.
* __Action points:__ Everyone receives 3 action points per session. At the beginning of each session, these reset to this value. Additional action points per session may be purchased at 2mp per action point.
* __Spending EP:__ For any voluntary effect that requires you to spend EP, you may spend more than you have in excess of your current level. You do not lose levels. However, you do incur a [negative level](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/naturalSpecialAbilities.htm#energyDrainAndNegativeLevels) for each level below your current level your new experience total represents.
