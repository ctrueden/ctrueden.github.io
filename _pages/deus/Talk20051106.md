Things to do:
*Make a list of all PCs' contacts, enemies, abilities, and backstory elements -- we want to involve each PC according to his characteristics, and leave no one out. More dice rolls, and more vital party roles.
**Verify that every PC is pursuing an appropriate and satisfying advanced class.
*Use this list to fuel the plan for Saturday's involvement in the Lupus/Canis war and their acquisition of the Crown.


# Monday/Wednesday joint session

We are shooting for a joint session #7 between Monday and Wednesday wherein they battle Cain and take care of him.
*They might disable him so that Moss can cleanse him.
*They might destroy his body somehow... but how?
*They might all die.
*Other possibilities exist.

Monday/Wednesday #7:
*Battle with Cain.
*Cain is cleansed by Moss, maybe.
*Moss becomes undead!
