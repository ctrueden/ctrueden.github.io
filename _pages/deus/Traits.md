-=Character traits=-

Character traits, introduced in Unearthed Arcana, help to define your character in more depth. They neither cost merit points nor grant them (each trait has pros and cons). Characters may possess up to five traits.

!!!Abrasive
You are difficult and demanding in conversation, which tends to oppress those around you.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Diplomacy checks and Bluff checks.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might be loud and abrupt or quiet and sinister, but either way, most find them disconcerting or irritating.

!!!Absent-Minded
You are fascinated by knowledge and learning and are capable of pursuing complex trains of thought quite quickly. However, your preoccupation with such thoughts makes you a little less aware of your surroundings.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Knowledge checks (although this does not let you use a Knowledge skill untrained).
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Senses checks.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might flit from idea to idea, trailing off in mid-sentence or mumbling their way through complex ideas. Conversely, characters with this trait might be extremely articulate but still allow their thoughts to move faster than the pace of a conversation.

!!!Aggressive
You are quick to initiate combat, and you tend to press the attack once battle is joined. Your enthusiasm makes you a dangerous foe, but you sometimes leave yourself open to blows that a more cautious warrior would avoid.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty to Armor Class.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait are often hot-headed and quick to anger, or simply think that the best defense is a quick offense.

!!!Brawler
You naturally move close to your opponents when fighting, instinctively grabbing and punching rather than striking with weapons.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on unarmed attack rolls and grapple checks.
__Drawback:__ You talk a -1 penalty on all other attack rolls.
__Special:__ The bonus from this trait doesn't apply to natural weapons. A character with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat can't select this trait (if a character with this trait later gains that feat, he loses the trait).
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait often disdain the use of weapons entirely, and some eventually learn more refined martial arts based on their instinctive fighting techniques. Many brawlers might not even be consciously aware that they fight differently from other characters; they simply know that the best way to take someone out of a fight is to grab him or punch him in the face.

!!!Cautious
You are cautious in combat, even a bit cowardly, and you take more care to defend yourself than others. However, this caution renders you susceptible to fear effects.

__Benefit:__ You gain an additional +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class whenever you fight defensively or take the total defense action.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on saving throws made to resist fear effects.
__Special:__ You cannot select this trait if you have immunity to fear or fear effects. If you later gain immunity to fear, you lose the benefit of this trait.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might consistently urge talking rather than fighting, or they might do little to encourage that their companions avoid combat and simply remain as far away from foes as possible, using ranged weapons or spells.

!!!Detached
You maintain a distance from events that keeps you grounded but limits your reaction speed.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Will saves.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Reflex saves.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait are likely to be quiet and restrained, but they might be vocal when others falter in their beliefs.

!!!Dishonest
You are naturally deceitful and insincere with others. You have a talent for lying, but have difficulty convincing others when you do speak truthfully.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Bluff checks.
__Drawback:__ You take a -2 penalty on Diplomacy checks.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might be portrayed as crafty liars, or lying might simply be second nature to them, making actually telling the truth a difficult chore.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Reputation checks.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Disguise checks.

__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might be sensitive about it, or they might paly up its presence to gather attention, sympathy, or notoriety.

!!!Easygoing
You are naturally friendly. Others feel comfortable around you, but this trait also makes it more difficult for you to be pushy or suspicious.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Gather Information checks.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Intimidate checks and Sense Motive checks.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might be more easily manipulated in interactions with NPCs, or they might simply prefer not to argue and instead use their natural talent to learn more about the world around them.

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Reflex saves.
__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might see their hpysical prowess as normal and look down on less hardy individuals, or they might see it as their duty to play the role of protector and help those less able to endure physical hardship.

__Drawback:__ You are illiterate.
__Special:__ You can eliminate the negative effect of this trait by spending 2 skill points to become literate.

__Roleplaying Ideas:__ Characters with this trait might be sensitive about not being able to read, or they might not value &quot;book learnin'.&quot;

__Benefit:__ You gain a +1 bonus on Sense Motive checks.
__Drawback:__ You take a -1 penalty on Bluff and Diplomacy checks, as your constant struggle to ferret out every nuance of your companions' facial expressions takes its toll on your own social defenses.
