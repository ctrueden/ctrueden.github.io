Jasmine de Vide|3+|Fast 3, Infiltrator 1, Entropomancer 5 (Complete Divine), Fatespinner 5 (Complete Arcane), Weaver 6 (Quintessential Sorcerer)||

Josef Derrota -- Starts off without memory of who he was, seems friendly, slowly remembers his past -- does he revert to his old ways now that he's been cleansed of backlash?

Jasmine de Vide -- entropomancer/swindler/fatespinner/weaver character -- Believes in predestination, but wants to fight it for some reason -- come up with a compelling backstory.

Caretaker -- Constructing something out of souls to protect itself; events are coming to a head, needs more souls more quickly, and takes more drastic action to accelerate the dying process. It could harness the royals for its plans.

Harry Ballsucker -- This fictional character is fictional, especially fictional because he is fictional within the fictional game world.

The Destroyer -- Duh.

The Fearful -- Complicated.

The Silent Syndicate -- The galactic &quot;Illuminati&quot; secret society and master crime ring. The Silent Syndicate has two factions. The current Syndicate leader is a member of the self-interested faction, which is currently in control. The current leader could be a major villain -- Adam McLean thinks it's him, but actually there is someone even more powerful... possibly, Bryant's secretary?

Gaia's Ancient Order -- x

The Arcane Order -- Half remained on Earth, half returned to the astral plane. So some are still alive there. Whether they get involved remains to be seen. They would, if they were to learn that Merlin Huntington is still alive.

Mercabah Earth -- Harry Bryant.

William Moss -- Has the trust of Ian Thorpe. So AJ might get a clue as to Moss's activities, and be concerned about them. Moss has been using Thorpe's drug to unnaturally boost his abilities to accomplish some really important project.

Everlily Nyx -- Is she still working with Moss? What happened to her?

Xela -- Her deal with the Caretaker has her reincarnated into a new gnomish body every time she dies -- Gerald as well (although Gerald hasn't died yet, and Xela has but once). This includes her memories from past lives, unlike normal. In return, the royals have been genetically engineered to obey commands given directly from the Caretaker when necessary.

StratCo -- Survived by moving into the field of genetics. They are largely responsible for Europe remaining powerful.

Magitech -- Still based on the moon, now being run by Sara's children, Adana (Addie) and Evan Cassenti.
