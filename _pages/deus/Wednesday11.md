Wednesday pirate situation:
*Things were accelerated with the loss of the children
*The five adults do everything in their power to continue destroying the computer systems
*Blacksoul &amp; Strife attack immediately
*Blacksoul docks really aggressively and loudly, to draw attention, at the airlock, sending his mooks in first
*Strife docks quietly near the antimatter core, to stealthily disable it, steal their technology and take them by surprise from behind

If they see any of the pirate ships' internals, they find crates labeled with a symbol (the [symbol of Arcadia](http://www.festivalarcadia.com/arcadia.jpg)), filled with Gaian body parts (umber hulk heads, beholder eyestalks, pixie wings, troll-in-a-can, werewolf fangs, bloody siren vocal cords, dwarven hearts, medusa heads &amp; basilisk eyes -- random chance of turning to stone if Fort Save DC 15 is failed when crate is opened).

Dorian does not know where the base is -- only that Blacksoul let it slip once. So that leaves the Arcadia lead, if they choose to pursue it. If they capture Blacksoul, Dorian will want to kill him, in revenge, and take over his ship, the Obsidian Teknokon.

If they travel to Arcadia looking for answers, they may encounter certain people.

Arcadia NPCs:
*Members of the Brotherhood and/or Pandora's Children (including Strife, since she was already aware of Arcadia's new location and did not need to track it down)
*Local criminal elements
*Josef?
