__[[Wed 17]:__
* Technofearful move on to Mars
* Moss, Nyx &amp; Aries

## Trenton's Time Stop ability
For a 10 mp cost, Trenton can manifest ''[time stop](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/timeStop.htm)'' at will. However, he must be in his state of improved consciousness first. During the time stop, he must pay the 3 vitality per round to maintain the state of improved consciousness, or the time stop ends.

He may use any of his offensive Pandora's Champion abilities against creatures during the time stop, with all results happening after the time stop ends (i.e., saves rolled and effects incurred).

Using time stop immediately costs 40 vitality, and also renders him [exhausted](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#exhausted) afterwards. In addition, movement made during the time stop can be noticed by creatures after the time stop ends with a DC 30 Senses roll (they see a blur of motion).

## Cooperating with the undead
UNF is very dubious about cooperating with Moss, but Moss indicates he can help neutralize this threat, in exchange for Alexandria being recognized officially by the UN as its own nation, and granted a place as a UN member state.

Moss first contacts the UN mystically, but may show in person with Nyx if his diplomatic advances are well received. Moss is very diplomatic, but definitely intense and devoted to the welfare of his undead nation. Nyx is much fiercer, and still angry at the Wednesday group. (Moss is angry as well, but keeps his head.)

## Aries and Phobos
Aries appears on the ship, and demands they assist him (&quot;I warned you to leave. If you wish for me to spare your lives...&quot;). His plan is to charge Phobos with mystic energy, and wants to taint the stream with backlash as he does so. Trenton and Unity are certainly capable of assisting him.

(This only happens if Aries has a reason to believe they possess this power. If it does happen, he forcibly grabs them and ''extracts'' the backlash, channeling it through him and into the mystic stream he is creating with the other hand.)

## Malcolm cleansing the undead
It is possible Malcolm could use a miracle with 5,000 XP to try something really big. It might be possible for him to cleanse the undead, but it will cost him more than 5,000. He can feel his life energy draining away, fueling the miracle, as he does so. (It is up to Oz whether he keeps paying more EP, or stops at 5,000.) If he does pay more, he eventually passes out after incurring too many negative levels. He isn't be dead -- merely in a coma. The only way to revive him is for the tower to recreate his body, thus recharging him.

## Results of the attack
Even if a  strong blow is dealt against the invading force, a portion of it still crashes down against Mars. Zombies rise up out of the ground all over where the aliens hit, and they are consumed. Actually, Moss ''wants'' his people involved, especially if the PCs allow him to assist their research with the substance, because he has come to the conclusion he can still maintain control, and that the substance will strengthen his people. Actually, there is an 80% survival rate (20% of undead affected simply self-destruct), but those that survive are indeed stronger, and still under Moss's control. He and Nyx allow themselves to be infected as well (though Nyx is uncertain, she is willing to do it for Moss).

## Directing the Void to attack Mars
Contact Eddie, convince him to move to Mars. If this happens, we're all set for the rift in space-time when the Destroyer arrives.

## Dr. Baelom
If Laiden asks Adana Cassenti about tracking down who Dr. Baelom is, she is confused, and asks, &quot;Track down who?&quot; She has no memory of reading Laiden's mind and seeing images of Baelom.

Serra makes an offhand comment about how she has been talking to Laiden's psicrystal (which has identified itself as Virgo), and that it wishes to be awakened. She says that Joshua is willing to do so, and asks Laiden what he thinks.

If Laiden objects, Serra points out that the psicrystal is an AI, and says she thinks it should have a right to make its own decisions.

Once it is awakened, it will hatch into Asmodeus, a 13-foot-tall (but he inexplicably fits in smaller areas) man with dark hair, handsome as a thunderstorm is beautiful, with passionate red eyes. He is dressed in exquisite finery worth more than most people could afford in a lifetime of toil. He clutches a large ruby, which he hands to Laiden, and says it is what remains of the crystal, and that it will still function for Laiden (the meticulous personality fragment).

I am one damned able devil meddler = Did Laiden dream elven med baelom?
Dr Baelom sees us = Asmodeus rebels

Asmodeus thanks Laiden and explains what happened (see [CharSecretsJason](CharSecretsJason) for details). He offers to allow Laiden to become one of his disciples (convert as many levels as desired into Disciple of Asmodeus levels -- see page 57 of the Book of Vile Darkness for details). If Laiden declines, he instead promises him a wish (he could wish for experience if desired -- 500 EP).

Asmodeus has a significant amount of disdain for Laiden's companions, and for Malcolm in particular.

__Malcolm:__ He calls Malcolm a pathetic creature, and tells him the truth about the Caretaker, heaven and hell, etc. He offers Malcolm a position as his servant, and is unsurprised when Malcolm refuses.

__Peters:__ He tells Peters that it is good to see him having coming so far. &quot;I am pleased you have overcome your supposed weaknesses.&quot; Peters knows that he is hearing the voice of the one who once trained him in psionics.

__Noun:__ &quot;If you wish to attain that to which you aspire, come with me now.&quot; And Noun senses that Asmodeus is right in a cosmic sense. If he refuses, Asmodeus orders him, &quot;Attend me!&quot; Noun must save to avoid submitting (see Asmodeus's entry in Vile Darkness).

When Asmodeus leaves, everyone (even Malcolm, unless he accepted Asmodeus's offer, and Peters) except Laiden forgets him.

If the others teleport after him immediately (he'll drop a hint that he and Noun are going to the Sanctuary), then they can be sucked into the same space-time rift as Saturday.
