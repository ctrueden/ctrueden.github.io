## The concept

The character possesses a heretofore unknown type of mystical abilities, a kind that goes completely undetected by the mystic detection devices pioneered by Dr. Dirk Phoenix. The character has kept these abilities secret, and may have a strange destiny ahead of him...

~~#FF0000:I was thinking about your character, and thought of some things you might want merits in. If you made him a physical tinkerer in addition to a computer guy (he is really smart, after all), then he could have built his own techo-gadgets from spare parts. So you could buy cybernetic or gravitic dealies for various purposes, such as flight. They would cost the same as attaining those abilities through mystic, genetic, or other means. If that's getting a little too mad scientist/supervillain for you, you could maybe buy computer merits that function in VR, giving you an advantage there. Just something to think about.~~

The following is still quite rough.  For what I've writen so far, this is going to be an int based character.  I was also thinking of having him be involved in an undergound society that aims to level the playing field between the classes, and between the races and mystic/non-mystics.  I'll try to review this again soon to see if I can make this fit any better.  If anyone else reading this has any sugestions, please let me know.

* __character name:__ &lt;work in progress&gt;
* __family history and relations:__ He had gotten very ill as a child.  This left him frail and weak, and damaged most of his senses.  He was raised by his father.  He's not sure what happened to his mother, but he never knew her.  His father was poor and had to work to support them.  Consequently &lt;pc name&gt; spent a lot of time alone, or in school or school programs.
* __physical description:__ Small and frail.  Think glasses.  More coming.
* __identifying characteristics:__ ...
* __personality:__ Persistant.  He made it into a prestigous university on a scholarship even though he grew up going to poorer schools.
* __religious views:__ If there is a god, then there must be a reason he is as afflicted as he is.  If not, then he must have been really horrible in his past lives.
* __daily habits:__ The equivalent of checking many websites.
* __quirks:__ Poor health, vegetarian.
* __likes &amp; dislikes:__ He likes when he can relate to people, otherwise he likes playing on the computer.
* __occupation:__ student
* __schooling:__ In a high class univerity even though he's from a poor background.
* __job satisfaction:__ He enjoys the learning part of school, but hates/ignores the social aspects.
* __hobbies:__ computers
* __friends:__ He's more of a loaner.  No one else is aflicted like him, and few people want to deal with it.  He has created several AIs to keep him company though.  One of them tries to see things from a normal persons point of view, the other sees things from the point of view of someone who has gotten the shaft all their lives.
* __enemies:__ Enhanced rich kids.
* __greatest achievement:__ Getting into the university.
* __greatest failure or disappointment:__ Trying to fit in.

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
1. Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?  1 (unles a really good friend he is afraid to lose)
1. Help a frail old woman cross the street?  1  Not that he wouldn't like to help, but crossing the street isn't something that he's all that good at to begin with.
1. Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible? 2  Would tell close friends or professors, but not anyone else.
1. Give money to a beggar on the street?  1  He has no spare money.  Also his father had to work hard, and he works hard.  Bumming is not hard work.
1. Seek vengeance if wronged?   2  He's gotten revenge on kids who have picked on him before, and while it was fun at the time, it was ultimatly a hollow act.  It didn't help his possition at all, and just created more tension.
1. Steal if he thought he could get away with it?  3  Depends.  He won't take something that was earned, but if someone was given but not appriciated, he has no qualms taking it.

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
1. Aliens?  Possible, even likely.
1. Karma?  He's either paying back a lot of karma, or he has a destiny ahead of him.
1. Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?  He didn't until recent events.
1. Time travel?  Backwards, not likely, but controling the rate forward should be possible.
1. Equality for all sentient beings?  Very much.
1. God or other supreme force?  See above.

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
1. Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.  2
1. The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.  5
1. Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.  2
1. No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life. 2
1. Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications. 3 (I don't know how well it was tested before.)  He sees it as a way for the fortunate to become more fortunate, but it doesn't do much to help in general.
1. Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day. 2  Technology has the possiblity of helping everyone and being equitably distributed, while mystic engergy creates a favored class.

### Class Features
The following features pertain to the Netmind advanced class.

__Seeing the Code:__ At 1st level, the Netmind begins to perceive the physical  universe as just another incarnation of virtual reality. By expending an action  point, he can substitute a Research check in place of any of the following skill checks: Decipher Script, Gather Information, Investigate, Knowledge, Search,  Sense Motive, and Senses.

__Remote Read:__ At 2nd level, the Netmind can read data off of any electronically stored medium, regardless of its availability on an electronic network. Copying data from an electronic medium is taxing, and requires the  Netmind to maintain continual concentration (a standard action each round). Data transferred in this manner is copied at one half the normal rate of access, and is read as it exists on the medium (so encrypted data is still encrypted, etc.).

__Writing the Code:__ At 3rd level, the Netmind starts to realize he can manipulate the physical universe similarly to virtual reality, in a limited fashion. By expending an action point, he can substitute a Computer Use check in  place of any of the following skill checks: Balance, Climb, Craft, Disable  Device, Disguise, Escape Artist, Forgery, Gamble, Jump, Navigate, Perform,  Repair, Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Swim, Treat Injury, Tumble.

__Bridging the Gap:__ At 4th level, the Netmind may leap between branches of a route that do not normally connect logically or physically. Doing so makes the connection virtually impossible to trace. To leap between an unconnected route, the Netmind must have current access to both target machines.

__Stepping Through the Code:__ At 5th level, the Netmind begins to see himself as just an instance of a program within the great machine. As a full-round action, he may to transfer his physical form (including objects in his possession) from the physical universe to the virtual one. As another full-round action, he may leave the virtual realm at any time, reentering the physical at the location corresponding to the virtual node that he is currently accessing. Only objects that entered the virtual realm with him come back out.

__Seeing Through the Code:__ At 6th level, the Netmind beings to visually percieve the world around him as code which defines each element of reality.  Different aspects of reality are shown as different colors.

__Permanent Connections:__ At 7th level, the Netmind maintains constant network connections, regardless of a physical connection normally being possible (blocked, no access points, etc). Once he has connected to a particular machine, the connection becomes permanent, allowing continual access from then on,  regardless of physical distance or network status. As long as the machine is in  current operation (even if it is no longer networked), he may still access it. He may maintain a number of permanent connections equal to his Netmind level (and he may drop a permanent connection at any time to make room for new connections).

__Cut and Paste:__ At 8th level, the Netmind develops the ability to temporarily  &quot;download&quot; virtual objects into physical reality. As a standard action, the  Netmind may spend an action point to physically manifest any mundane item for  which he has a thorough virtual model. Possible objects include any mundane item listed in the d20 Modern or d20 Future books normally available for purchase (in this campaign setting). Downloaded objects may have a mass no more than 20 lbs per Netmind level, a total purchase DC no more than 20 + twice his Netmind level, and last a number of rounds equal to the Netmind's class level.

__Carbon Copy:__ At 9th level, the Netmind has learned to download his avatar's operational parameters into his physical being for a limited time. Once per day as a free action, he may take on all characteristics of his avatar for a number of rounds equal to his Netmind level.

__Temporal Connection:__ At 10th level, the Netmind may attempt to connect to a network that once existed, but now no longer does. He must have physical access  to some component of that network (e.g., one of the computers, a router, etc.). As a full-round action, the Netmind may expend an action point to establish a connection with the network as it existed at some point in the past. Once  connected, he may engage in all the normal activities, but any alterations he makes do not actually affect the past, nor do they persist if he accesses the  network again at a later time. He may remain connected to the past network for up  to 20 minutes.

__Universal Network:__ At 11th level, the Netmind's new understanding of reality reaches its pinnacle, and he fully comprehends the patterns of life in their myriad forms. The Netmind perceives biological and social networks as computer  networks, and can manipulate them on a similar level. For example, by making the  appropriate Computer use checks, he can immediately integrate himself into a  social network, without members of that network treating him as a trusted friend.  Similarly, he could disconnect someone else from said network. The DC for  Computer Use checks to manipulate social or biological networks is +20 more  difficult than the corresponding check for computer networks.

__Being the Code:__ At 12 level, reality treats the Netmind as if he were his Avitar.  This ability is as Carbon Copy, except with no round limit.
