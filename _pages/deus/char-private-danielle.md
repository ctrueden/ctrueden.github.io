## Questionnaire

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
1. Lie to a friend to protect his feelings? ~~#FF0000:2 - I would also lie to them for fun, as long as it was not truly malicious.~~
1. Help a frail old woman cross the street? ~~#FF0000:3 - fairly neutral, the more &quot;worthy&quot; she was and the more in dire need the better chance that I would do it; otherwise it seems kinda demoralizing for her and boring for me~~
1. Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible? ~~#FF0000:4 - if I care to share then of course I would~~
1. Give money to a beggar on the street? ~~#FF0000:2 - muwahahahaa....we'll see~~
1. Seek vengeance if wronged? ~~#FF0000:5 - oh yeah, but usually with a tricky prank or making them understand worth more (not really the 'eye for an eye' thing)~~
1. Steal if he thought he could get away with it? ~~#FF0000:4 - almost all of the time~~

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
1. Aliens? ~~#FF0000:5~~
1. Karma? ~~#FF0000:5 (I strongly believe in it yet I strangely do some things that are fun but would generally be considered more of something to provoke bad karma and yet I don't think not that much, if any, will/should ever come my way)~~
1. Free will (i.e., many possible futures)? ~~#FF0000:5~~
1. Time travel? ~~#FF0000:4~~
1. Equality for all sentient beings? ~~#FF0000:4 - I believe that they should be treated equal and I do my best in this but I have some doubts about some that I do not mention, except rarely to other Gaians.~~
1. God or other supreme force? ~~#FF0000:5 (though they may be a little overbearing at times)~~

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
1. Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete. ~~#FF0000:1 - a soul, and maybe even a body, make you more sacred~~
1. The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs. ~~#FF0000:3~~
1. Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans. ~~#FF0000:4~~
1. No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.  ~~#FF0000:2 - I do not believe that it is an illusion but I do think they do not have a natural magestic tie to those around them and their creator and that they are therefore a bit inferior and plain unlucky.~~
1. Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications. ~~#FF0000:1 - mystic energy is too natural and good for it to cause any ramifications of any real concern.~~
1. Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day. ~~#FF0000:5 ~~


## Backstory

Like any other Taigan Pixy I was born in the late frosts of early spring from a pod under the strong and slightly abrasive protection of the trees.  I was born to a very old and straggly Tamarack.  My childhood was fairly normal; I played with the others in the bogs and streams, and along the ice banks and mountain caves in the colder weather.  I was always more apt to spend long hours exploring the dark, cold tunnels under the waterfalls and deep in the crevices of the mountains.  Most of my siblings and kindred spirits much more enjoyed basking in the sun and playing tricks on the animals and members of our neighboring communities.  Don't get me wrong, I would have loved to play these tricks with them but I was born much more pale than even our fairest dew drops and my eyes were even without normal coloring.  My appearance seemed a bit unsettling and occasionally extremely alluring or interesting to many Terrans that I came across.  The thing that really changed my life was my eyes.  I always had problems with depth perception and things were generally hazy and sometimes totally indiscernable.  I had no where near the skill at flying as my siblings simply because I was so disoriented that I could not go anywhere unless I was assured by my kindred that there was a large open field that I wouldn't have to navigate, but those flights still ended in poor or even devastating landings.

I always investigated plants and objects in great detail.  Even as my siblings were going off on their own paths and venturing farther from our village I was still maticulously discovering and putting to memory all of the elements of my surroundings that I could.  The elders could see that I had become quite fond of nature and her progression.  One warm day one of them told me that I should go see a friend of his in a larger village near the south edge of the forest.  I saw nothing to lose and, at the age of thirty-two, I had 'seen' as much of my portion of the forest as I thought I really could.  So I ventured to Xanadu and met Nexus Almorad, a quirky pixy who was so old that his wings were barely useful to him any longer, and his brain was becoming a bit absent as well.  All in all he was still a wealth of knowledge.  He had worked as a technodruid and was able to show me totally new aspects and advantages to methods of dealing with the forests.  I was useful to him; since even with my impaired sight I was still able to move around better than him and I could, though slowly, fly around to get needed samples and whatnot.  I worked and learned from him for nye on six years, and we became great friends.

Nexus saw that I was happy enough but he thought that we should use technology to live to our fullest extent.  He saw the limited ability of my eyes as an opportunity.  Eventually he found that one of his former students was fairly established amongst the medical community as well from all of her work with genetic engineering flora.  He and I went to visit her to see how her contacts might be able to rectify my eyes.  Elana Connendeol was a gorgeous, highly intelligent elfvan who was constantly studying new ways to engineer plants in the most efficient and natural ways as possible.  She was easily able to find a docor to perform a few minor surgeries on my retina, and optical nerve to enhance my eyesight to near normal.  (I am now able to see well in general, still and bit better at night, and I only have a little trouble when trying to focus on something fairly close while moving around at the same time.)

My new eyesight opened up a whole new apect of life to me and I started to explore in different ways.  Nexus was getting to old to carry on enough experiments to keep me busy and since I had already explored his region a great deal I stayed on with Elana for the next four years.  She taught me a great deal about the science and technilogical advances that had and could be utilized with flora, and fauna for that matter.  She expected a lot of dedication and hard work, as well as a sufisticated sort of maturity out of me.  I had little time to explore and enjoy the sights except when we were doing field work.  When we were finally done with a huge fern project that she had been working on I politely took leave of her to find my own path.

I spent a few years exploring the far reaches of the forest and always practicing my manuverability and speed in flight.  I visited home and some of my kindred in their lives as well.  In melancholy reminicance of our childhood years I came to find how much fun I could still have tricking and testing people.  I also found that the arrows mentioned by my comrads in youth were indeed as much fun if not more than they made them out to be.  To have such range on trickery in amazing!
My interest in plants was never questioned, and now animals were much more interesting, and observable than before, as well.  Through my travels I always took samples and did what I could to do various tests on them and their effects and abilities.  As a result, at the age of forty-eight, I found myself back in Xanadu applying at the university to study Botany.

School was an absolutely wonderful place to start making up for lost time in trickery as a youth.  I also made many more friends than ever before.

As a sophomore I got an internship with Ezra Talmanese and his group.  We were able to perform more indepth experiments than I had ever done.  I also got highly involved with the Gaian Union through Ezra.  I had always had a knack with people and Ezra, being the shy one he is, brought me along to a meeting once to help draw some attention from him and so that heh wouldn't have to explain our work a million &quot;2nd&quot; times.  I hit it off and was able to help with negotiations and larger debates about the future of the forests.  Though basically a rooky still at the time, I was involved in the ground work of the GUs efforts to work with the UN on off world colonies in 2286.  I graduated a year later and helped with the talks of our methods and means of creating these new arboretums.  This has been a long a tedious process, and everyone will never wholly agree, but it as been well worth it.

I am currently the Project Manager for the Percepi Colony Arboretum project.   I have been working on this project in particular since the finalization on the colony deed documents, about six years now, and I have been Project Manager for four.  I am currently living on the Percepi Colony in order to balance and smoothly implement the creation process.  I am actually very thankful for the patience, control, and maturity that I learned to express from Elana.  I use them more even than my people skills, and often in conjuction with as well.  Thank Gaia, I also have some freetime to relax and continue to catch up on my juvenile joys.

## Technodruid

Gaia's Ancient Order has long been affiliated with a secret organization known as the druids. But since Gaia and Emmanuel joined to form the Caretaker nearly 300 years ago, many in the Order have embraced science, and strived to find a harmonious balance between nature and technology. One result of this effort has been the formation of a new order of druids, known as the technodruids.

Equally comfortable in urban and natural surroundings, the technodruids apply the scientific method to improve their natural surroundings responsibly, while honoring the tenets of Gaia to respect all life, be it natural, artificial, or somewhere in between.

### Class Information
The following information pertains to the technodruid advanced class.

__Hit Die__
The technodruid gains 1d8 hit points per level. The character's constitution modifier applies.

__Class Skills__
The technodruid's class skills are as follows.
Computer Use (Int), Concentration (Con), Craft (electronic, mechanical, structural, visual arts) (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Knowledge (earth and life sciences, technology, theology and philosophy) (Int), Mysticraft (Int), Navigate (Int), Profession (Wis), Repair (Int), Ride (Dex), Senses (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), Treat Injury (Wis).

The technodruid receives (5 + Int) skill points per level.

### Class Features
The following features pertain to the technodruid advanced class.

__Animal Companion:__ A technodruid may choose to befriend or construct an animal, taking it on as a companion. This animal is a loyal creature that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind. Both organic and artificial animals are acceptable candidates. If an organic animal is chosen, the technodruid may implant cybernetic devices to protect her friend on their dangerous journeys. If her companion is an artificial animal, she may upgrade the robot's systems for its own protection.

__Nature Sense:__ A technodruid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (earth and life sciences) and Survival checks.

__Artifice Sense:__ A technodruid gains a +2 bonus on Craft (electronic), Craft (mechanical) and Knowledge (technology) checks.

__Wild Empathy:__ At 2nd level, a technodruid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The technodruid rolls 1d20 and adds her technodruid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the empathy check result.

The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the technodruid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A technodruid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

__Machine Empathy:__ At 2nd level, a technodruid learns to better influence the attitude of a machine intelligence, adding her technodruid level to Diplomacy checks when dealing with an AI. She is also skilled at coaxing broken machines to work, gaining a bonus to her Repair checks equal to her technodruid level.

__Wild Shape:__ At 3rd level, a technodruid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per technodruid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

The form chosen must be that of an animal the technodruid is familiar with.

A technodruid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)

A technodruid can use this ability more times per day at 6th and 9th level, as noted on Table: The technodruid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large or Tiny animal at 6th level, and a Huge animal at 9th level.

The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's technodruid level.

__Machina Shape:__ At 3rd level, a technodruid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium robot and back again once per day (see the [Robots](http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/msrd/FutureRobots.rtf) section of the d20 Future book for details). Her options for new forms include robots with any combination of features detailed in the Robots chapter, except for liquid-state, skillware and featware (the robot shares the technodruid's skills and feats). This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 minute per technodruid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to robot or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

The form chosen must be that of a robot the technodruid is familiar with (either through physical interaction, or advance planning).

A technodruid loses her ability to speak while in robot form unless the robot is equipped with a Vocalizer accessory (see page 188 of the d20 Future book), but she retains use of her neural interface, if she has one.

A technodruid can use this ability more times per day at 6th and 9th level. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large or Tiny robot at 6th level, and a Huge robot at 9th level.

The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's technodruid level. In addition, the total purchase DC of the robot (see page 191 of the d20 Future book) cannot exceed 20 + three times her technodruid level.

__Woodland Stride:__ At 4rd level, a technodruid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

__Urban Stride:__ At 4rd level, a technodruid may move through any sort of difficult man-made area (such as construction zones, sewers, city ruins, etc.) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.

__Trackless Step:__ At 5th level, a technodruid leaves no trail in natural or urban surroundings and cannot be tracked. She does not appear on electronic monitoring devices (such as cameras). She may choose to leave a trail or appear on monitoring devices if so desired.

__Poison Immunity:__ At 7th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons, both natural (e.g., venom) and artificial (e.g., toxic chemicals).

__A Thousand Faces:__ At 8th level, a technodruid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the ''[alter self](http://d20srd.org/srd/spells/alterSelf.htm)'' spell, but only while in her normal form.

__Timeless Body:__ After attaining 10th level, a technodruid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place.

Bonuses still accrue, and the technodruid still dies of old age when her time is up.
