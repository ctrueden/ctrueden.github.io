#### Additional Nanomagus Feats
__Amorphous Grapple__: When the nanomagus attempts a grapple (or engulf attack), he does not provoke an attack of opportunity.  As well, the nanomagus gains a +4 bonus on all opposed grapple checks.  Using this ability causes the nanomagus to revert to liquid form, revealing that he is not humanoid.

__Engulf__: The nanomagus gains an engulf attack.  To use the engulf attack, the nanomagus must attempt to grapple an opponent.  If successful, the nanomagus reverts to his liquid form and completely surrounds the target.  An engulfed target cannot breathe, is considered grappled, and takes 1d6 nanite damage per round.  This damage supercedes any unarmed strike damage caused by initiating the grapple.  This feat may be taken multiple times, each time increasing the damage dealt by 1d6 per round.  Engulfing an opponent requires the nanomagus to remain in the opponent's square.

__Quick Shift__: The nanomagus gains the ability to shift into his liquid form as a move-equivalent action.  The nanomagus can use this ability to escape a grapple without having to make an opposed check unless the opponent has some way of grappling a liquid.  Finally, the nanomagus may use this ability to stand up from a prone position as a free action.  Standing in this way makes the nanomagus's form shift and shimmer.

__Technological Adaptation:__  The nanomagus can incorporate any cybernetic part into its form seamlessly, without surgery.  It requires a move-equivalent action to attach or remove a cybernetic part.

|Level|BA Bonus|Fort|Ref|Will|Class Features|Def Bonus|Rep Bonus|
|1|+0|+0|+0|+2|Nanomagic, Familiar Colony|+1|+1|
|2|+1|+0|+0|+3|Nanomagic|+1|+1|
|3|+1|+1|+1|+3|Nanomagic, Bonus Feat|+2|+1|
|4|+2|+1|+1|+4|Nanomagic|+2|+2|
|5|+2|+1|+1|+4|Nanomagic|+3|+2|
|6|+3|+2|+2|+5|Nanomagic, Bonus Feat|+3|+2|

__Nanomagic__: The character uses mystic magic, casting as a Nanomagus.  This spellcasting is intelligence based.
__Familiar Colony__: A Nanomagus with the ''Autonomous Colonies'' feat can produce a single longer-lived subcolony at any time to act as a familiar.  This subcolony has a movement rate of 10 across ground (and fly 10 (perfect) if the Nanomagus has the ''Airborne Colonies'' feat, and burrow 10 if the Nanomagus has the ''Piercing Colonies'' feat).  It has the same sensory abilities as the Nanomagus that produced it.  It is 1 inch in diameter for each level of the Nanomagus, and amorphous enough to squeeze through the smallest of cracks.  It has statistics equal to the Nanomagus, except for strength which is at a -8 penalty (minimum 1) and intelligence which is indicated on the familiar properties table.  It is considered tiny size.  It uses the Nanomagus's base attack bonus (attacks use dexterity to hit), base saves, and skill ranks.  It gains a bonus to natural armor, also indicated on the familiar properties table.  In addition, the Improved Evasion, Share Spells, and Touch properties apply at the appropriate levels.  The Nanomagus does not have an empathic link with his familiar colony and cannot speak with it, but the familiar colony can rejoin the Nanomagus at any point.  If the familiar reintegrates into the Nanomagus, the Nanomagus absorbs all sensory data experienced by the colony.  The Nanomagus may produce only one familiar colony at any given time.  The familiar colony has a number of wound points equal to half the Nanomagus's (rounded down).  The familiar colony can have any number of vitality points up to half the Nanomagus's total (rounded down, number decided upon manifestation); however, while the familiar colony is in existence, the Nanomagus's current and maximum vitality point totals are reduced by that number.  If the colony reintegrates into the Nanomagus, he regains a number of current vitality points equal to the colony's, and his full maximum.  If the familiar colony is destroyed, the Nanomagus remains at reduced vitality and is unable to manifest another familiar colony for one full day.  After the day passes, he regains his maximum vitality and can manifest a new familiar colony.  If the familiar colony is somehow prevented from returning to the Nanomagus, it dissipates after one full day, with the same effects.

__Hit Dice__: The Sun Cleric uses d8s as hit dice.
__Class Skills__: Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (current events, history, popular culture, theology and philosophy) (Int), Mysticraft (Int), Profession (Wis), Senses (Wis), Treat Injury (Wis)

## Eddie
### Questionnaire
## Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
5    Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?
1    Help a frail old woman cross the street?
''Eddie prefers to stay hidden, if possible.  He does not want his existence publicized, because he does not want the Caretaker to know that he exists.''
3    Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?
''Eddie has virtually no friends.  But if he did have friends, he'd tell them.''
1    Give money to a beggar on the street?
2    Seek vengeance if wronged?
''Eddie is more likely to run away.  However, if he can manage to stay hidden, he might retaliate with pranks or sabotage.''
4    Steal if he thought he could get away with it?
''&quot;Salvaging&quot; is the preferred term.  Given that he can't carry anything, he only steals what he can use, but has no real understanding of personal property.  Well, he's very smart, so he understands, but chooses to ignore conventional rules of ownership.''
## Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
2    Aliens?
''Eddie has been all over, and not seen any aliens.  They might exist, but if they do, they're far away.''
2    Karma?
''The Caretaker takes care of us all to some extent, but Eddie does not believe in an inherent mechanism in the universe to make people get what they deserve.''
5    Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?
1    Time travel?
''Eddie has studied normal physics, which prohibits conventional ideas of time travel.''
5    Equality for all sentient beings?
''Yes.  This is due to him being largely Gaian.  He understands that there are many kinds of sentient beings.''
5    God or other supreme force?
''The Caretaker is God.''
## What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
1    Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.
1    The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.
4    Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.
1    No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.
4    Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications.
1    Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day.
