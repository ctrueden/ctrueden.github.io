### Vadril's backstory

Vadril was cloned, as typical of the Royal species.  He was mentored by a Royal by the name of Ghendar (for the sake of simplicity, we'll call him his father).  His &quot;father&quot; worked on artificial development (mainly integrating the high-speed logic processing with the complexities of the various species' thought processes and emotions in everyday life in a grand approach to artificially creating a mystical &quot;soul&quot;).

His father always encouraged Vadril's studies, however, kept a rather emotionless distance from Vadril.  Vadril found himself feeling more to be a pupil to his father's scientific lectures than his son.  Vadril has great respect for his father, but feels no real need to prove himself to him.  In fact, he feels no real need to prove himself to anyone.  Vadril feels that true merits in life come from actual development and accomplishment (or what Vadril can determine it best as), rather than what the common man people feel is development and accomplishment.

Vadril got a full scientific degree in Artificial Intelligence (PH.D or equivalent).  He then was employed in a government scientific research group for a few years.  However, one day, when working on a strict government issue AI project, he felt a sudden halt of progress.  In fact, he felt himself intellectually incapable of continuing his research.  After a  short break from his job, he did something he's never done before.  He rejected pure logic and flipped a coin (heads - he would keep his job and stay on his current path, tails - he would give up his job and explore the universe for something more significant).  He didn't the coin believing that destiny would take over or a deity would interfere.  He flipped the coin to reject order and leave things up to pure chance.  He felt that in order to truly make progress, one has to expand one's thought past the convention that he has always known and must explore other ways of perceiving the universe.  This would be his motivation towards adventuring.  The coin flip came up tails.

Ever since then, he keeps the coin with him at all times, mostly fiddling and flipping it in his hands.  He perceived that other races are intriguing only in the way that they think and perceive the world.  He enjoys the company of people in that respect, however finds himself lacking the social abilities to maintain true close friendships.  He usually remains calm and collected in most situations, not experiencing or displaying much emotion.  However, emotions intrigue him the way that they tend to expand a train of thought, giving different perspectives.

Vadril is not a charismatic leader, rather a quiet, passive scientific observer.  He likes to give scientific explanations to the world, rather than justify the existence of any significant diety.  Vadril feels no desire for money or power.  He exists in the world to further his mind.  He feels that it will better the world for all people (showing a true good intention).  However, often enough, he finds himself oblivious to some people's needs.  He will openly oppose any being who he feels is doing &quot;evil,&quot; but these interpretations are (for the most part) based on how Vadril feels about the current situation.  He has a certain specific distaste for strict rules (due to his past problems with it).  He sees mystic power as a scientific and technological tool.  He believes that it can both explain science and be explained by science.

In order to &quot;optimize&quot; himself, Vadril tries to mix in the speed and efficiency of technological enhancements with his natural self.  He adapted his arms to include a various amount of tools that he can use to better interact with computers (basically, think of it being a hacker's toolkit kept in his arms).  He also enhanced his mental abilities suited for pure processing and memory enhancement (thereby, giving him an edge in intelligence) and increased his sensory perception (to help him better analyze and understand the world).  He also has mental enhancements that allow him to better analyze and perceive mystic powers.  &lt;writer's note&gt;if this is possible&lt;/writer's note&gt; Those enhancements would also allow him to better understand and enhance Vadril's own mystic power.

### The origin of the royals

One of the more popular rumors about the royals is that they are crossbreeds of gnomes and dwarves. While this is partially true, it is misleading.

In 2034, the dwarves and gnomes set aside their centuries-long war and forged a peace treaty that united their two countries into Midgard, the powerful dwarven/gnomish kingdom of today (2299). To unite their peoples, the gnomish princess Moreta married the dwarven prince Gerald, and they ruled together for many years (although Gerald never took much of an interest in politics, leaving Moreta to do most of the &quot;ruling&quot;).

Although gnomes and dwarves are genetically incompatible, Moreta and Gerald somehow produced an heir; however, he looked to be neither dwarven nor gnomish, having an elongated, blue-skinned appearance. This creature, who they named [Alfadir](http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Allfather_Alfadir/id/98867), was the first royal. One by one, more royals appeared, until there were several hundred in existence. Eventually, Alfadir took over the throne and still rules Midgard to this day.

Because they are the rightful heirs to the throne of Midgard, these creatures are called the royals. However, only the royals themselves know that Alfadir was created by sampling DNA from the Caretaker himself, and splicing it with that of Moreta and Gerald, to produce the first royal, who was then cloned. According to the royal teachings, one of the Caretaker's provisions for allowing this genetic sampling was the promise that the race created from it would pursue science and mysticism for the betterment of all Terrans.

The royals are androgenous, without sexual organs (a feature of the Caretaker's corporeal form). However, to fit in with other species, royals sometimes embrace a more masculine or feminine appearance (so it's okay for Vadril to have a mother figure and a father figure, if you wish). When royals wish to procreate (which is rare), they visit the cloning facility to pick up an infant child. Over the years, variations have been introduced to their species to provide some diversity, though many non-royals still have trouble telling them apart from one another (so it's okay that Vadril has different physical features than other royals).

There are enough royals in existence now that Vadril is probably not too high in Midgard's line of succession (though he can be if you wish; either way is fine with me -- maybe 127th or something?). I was thinking there are probably fewer than 1,000 royals in existence.

|10th|+5|+5|+5|+3|Build Robot Defenses|+5|+3|

__Class Features__
The following features pertain to the AI Researcher advanced class.

__Quick Hack__
At 1st, level, a AI Researcher can perform a Computer Use check in half the normal time.  However, cutting the Computer Use time increases the Computer Use check DC by 5.

__Scientific Improvisation__
At 2nd level, an AI Researcher gains the ability to improvise solutions using common objects and scientific know-how. This ability lets the Field Scientist create objects in a dramatic situation quickly and cheaply, but that have a limited duration.
By spending 1 action point and combining common objects with a Craft check that corresponds to the function desired, the Field Scientist can build a tool or device to deal with any situation. The DC for the Craft check is equal to 5 + the purchase DC of the object that most closely matches the desired function.
Only objects that can normally be used more than once can be improvised.
Electronic devices, special tools, weapons, mechanical devices, and more can be built with scientific improvisation. It takes a full-round action to make an object with scientific improvisation. The object, when put into use, lasts for a number of rounds equal to the AI Researcher's class level, or until the end of the current encounter, before it breaks down. It can't be repaired.

__Program Software Utility__
An AI Researcher knows a great deal about creating intelligence software utilities to aid on certain tasks.  An AI Researcher of 4th level or higher program a software utility  that will help him with various, computer-related tasks.  The programs will take 2d8 hours to make for one program for one specific skill.  The program will have the skill ability of the corresponding skill ability of the AI Researcher.  When attempting this ability, the AI Researcher can have the program assist.  The program will roll an assistance skill check, to aid the AI Researcher.  Since these programs involve a great deal of depth of knowledge and are a personal creation of the AI researcher, they are specific to him/her and his/her needs.  Therefore, they can not be properly utilized by any other person.  Acceptable Skills: Research, Computer Use, Craft (Electrical), Craft (Mechanical), Repair, Disable Device.

__Smart People Skills__
At level 5, an AI Researcher can successfully analyze interaction with people and apply his knowledge accordingly.  Any time the Researcher needs to make a Charisma and Charisma-based skills Check, he can add his Intelligence bonus, rather than his Charisma bonus.

__Smart Regeneration__
At level 7, an AI Researcher can program a computer connected to his nervous system to effectively &quot;speed up&quot; the body's natural regeneration process.  The AI Researcher has computer conscious control of this process.  This results in the AI Researcher being able to spend 3 Vitality points to gain 1 Wound point, at a rate of 1 Wound point per minute.


__Strategy Analysis__
At level 8, an AI Researcher and quickly come up with algorithms for combat strategy analysis.  These algorithms constantly evaluate a combat situation and gives strategic &quot;tips&quot; to the AI Researcher (tips such as &quot;stand here for a better shot&quot; or &quot;go here and you'll see them a second before they see you&quot;).  The AI Researcher can choose to send this strategic analysis to allies that have neural computers configured to accept the data, thus granting them the advantage as well.  This will grant a +2 insight bonus to attacking, defending, and saving throws.

__Build Robot__
An AI Researcher of 10th level or higher can build remote-controlled robots that are Tiny or Diminutive in size. These robots serve as the AI Researcher's eyes, ears, or hands out to a predetermined distance away from the character when the AI Researcher wants to use one of the following skills: Computer Use, Demolitions, Disable Device, or Repair.  The robot can inherently use the Spot/Listen skill (if the audio/visual sensor is installed), in which the robot will instantly return the data to the AI Researcher.  The AI Researcher must have at least 1 rank in the skill that he wants to program into the robot.

Follow these steps to build a robot.
Wealth Check:The purchase DC for the components needed to construct a robot is based on the robot's size.
|Size|Purchase DC|
|Diminutive|18|
|Tiny|15|
Make the Wealth check to purchase and gather the necessary components prior to starting construction.
Construct Frame: The robot's body determines its size, shape, locomotion, and hit points. The DC of the Craft (mechanical) check is set by the robot's size and modified by the form of locomotion selected.
|Size|Craft DC|
|Diminutive|15|
|Tiny|12|

|Components|DC Modifier|
|Frame Shape and Locomotion __1__|-|
|Bipedal|+4|
|Quadruped|+3|
|Treads|+2|
|Wheels|+1|
|Gravity-Altering Floating Device (Make the sound better Curtis)|+5|
|External Components__2__|-|
|Manipulators __3__|+3|
|Audio/visual sensor|+2|
|Remote Range__1__|-|
|Remote control link, 100 feet|+1|
|Remote control link, 200 feet|+3|
|Remote control link, 300 feet|+5|
|1 Select only one of the options in this category.|-|
|2 Select one or more of the options in this category.|-|
|3 Necessary for a robot built to use any skill except Listen or Spot.|-|
Select a frame size and form, add manipulators and sensors as necessary, and choose a type of remote control link. Add all the modifiers to determine the check's DC. Make the Craft (mechanical) check to construct the robot's frame.
It takes an AI Researcher 30 hours to construct a Diminutive robot frame or 12 hours to construct a Tiny robot frame.
A Diminutive robot can be 6 to 12 inches long or tall and weighs about 1 pound. A Tiny robot can be 13 to 24 inches long or tall and weighs up to 3 pounds. Statistics for these robots can be found in the Creature listings.
Construct the Electronics: The next step is to build the internal electronics for the robot and install them in the frame. The DC is based on the size of the robot and modified by the number of components that need to be wired together. For a Diminutive robot, the DC is 20. For a Tiny robot, the DC is 15. Add +1 to the DC for each external component and +2 for the remote link. Make the Craft (electronic) check.
It takes a Techie 12 hours to wire a Diminutive robot or 6 hours to wire a Tiny robot.
Program the Robot:The AI Researcher programs the robot as the final step. Decide how many ranks of the appropriate skill to program into the robot, up to the number of ranks the AI Researcher has in the skill. An AI Researcher's robot can only contain programming for one skill for level 3, two skills for level 6, and three skills for level 9. Make the Computer Use check to program the robot.
The DC for the Computer Use check is 20, modified by the number of ranks the Techie wants to program into the robot (+1 to the DC for each rank). It takes 1 hour to program the robot.
Reprogramming:A robot can be reprogrammed at any time. Doing this requires 1 hour of work and a Computer Use check (DC 20 + the number of ranks programmed into the robot).

__Build Robot Defenses__
At Level 10, the AI Researcher is able to incorporate a defense system (weapons) on the robots that he builds.  The AI Researcher can install any weapon, that is ranged and can be held in one hand, on the robot, of course altered to fit the robot's frame.  The damage and critical strike of the weapon remain the same.  In a situation where the AI Reasearcher needs the robot to fire, the AI Researcher can send an instant request for aid via the link between them.  If the robot is joining the battle, it makes itself a target and opponents attack accordingly.
