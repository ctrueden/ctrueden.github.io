Ariona was raised on a remote [space settlement](http://members.aol.com/oscarcombs/spacsetl.htm). She attended a reasonably prestigious university on [Percepi](worlds). After finishing her master's degree in applied genetics Ariona decided to travel to Earth itself to learn more of the planet of her forebears. She is currently employed in a small research lab; the project in which she is engaged is not publicly known.

A small and delicate young woman, Ariona is quite attractive in a rather quiet way.  She is extremely intelligent and quick-witted, but comes off as bookish and naive to the point of true and complete innocence.  While much of her lack of sophistication is likely due to her sheltered upbringing, somehow people around her just feel that she is too innocent to be corrupted by the rest of the world, and oftentimes her colleagues find themselves striving to protect her from the realities of life.  Ariona, however, appears to be completely unaware of her acquaintances' attempts to shelter her further.
