Brice is not a people person.  Actually, I guess it'd be more accurate to say that people don't know what to do wit Brice.  In an age of mysic healing and genetic engineering, most people fall into two categories, better and best.  Brice is neither of those.  He wouldn't even qualify as good.  A childhood illness dulled most of his senses, and now he can't get around very well without help.  Thankfully, technology is cheap.

Brice is in his third year at university where he studies pure technology.  He can be seen getting from class to class with the aid of a walking stick, and a small robotic dog that follows him everywhere.  If he had his choice, his education would be entirely virtual, but he had to follow the scholarship money.
