D.E.E. is a bioreplica robot.  Or at least he would have been, had he been finished.  Instead D.E.E. appears incomplete, lacking the usual layers of decoration that make bioreplicas seem more human (such as skin).  D.E.E.'s personality is also significantly more robotic than most bioreplicas, inhibiting his social interactions somewhat, and making it evident that he is not human even when he cannot be seen.

The starship he accompanies bears the same unfinished look, completely devoid of any aesthetic coloring or ornamentation, and with no registration codes or other identifying marks.  The only hint of the starship's origin is the symbol emblazoned on it's bow of a sword hanging over a crescent.
