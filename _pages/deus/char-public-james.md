* physical description:  Zee looks at most 18-20 years old.  He'd be slightly shy of six feet talk if he didn't hunch over so often.  He has messy, thin hair that's so light blond it's almost white.  He's probably natural clean-shaven, seeing how his hands shake so much shaving would be a catastrophe.  His eyes are light brown and very twitchy or completely empty.  He has a frequent nervous tick and a minor stuttering problem.  His sentences often trail into mumbo jumbo.  He's a bit sickly looking, like he's recovering from a bad fever.
* identifying characteristics:  His clothing is usually baggy, tattered or messy.  It's not uncommon for him to break into a nervous sweat.  There are odd scars on his head that are visible though his thinning hair.
* personality:  Depends on the day.  Sometimes seems manic/depressive at best, schizophrenic at worst.  Other days he's nearly in a fugue state.  His demeanor is dynamic and unpredictable.
