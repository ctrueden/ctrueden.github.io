# Eddie

Eddie appears to be the ghost of a halfling.  However, he is not.

Eddie enjoys taking things apart, and putting them back together again.  He appears either as a semitranslucent halfling dressed in spacer coveralls and goggles, or as a shimmering distortion in space.  When he is using tools, they tend to float near him.

He isn't very social, but if you're nice to him, maybe he'll do nice things for you.
