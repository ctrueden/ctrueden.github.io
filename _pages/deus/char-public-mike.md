Vadril is tall, slender humanoid with bluish-tinged skin.  He has long (a little higher than shoulder length), pitch black hair that hangs down and covers a good proportion of his facial features.  He has piercing green eyes that actually seem to glow in some lights.  He is quiet and appears shy, but has a look that appears it could light up with intensity when prompted (I think it's the eyes).  He is typically wearing a long black cloak that covers most of his body (except below his knees).  However, you can see he carries a bag that is slung over his shoulder.
