This page will provide the GMs a restricted page to discuss secrets related to Danielle's character.

FLEXIBLE - possibly the colony disappearance plot, because maybe she knows the Heart Tree there has ceased to be

A creature of Gaia's Ancient Order - a druid, possibly a pixie or dryad

Maybe she is involved in the effort to place a Great Forest on each colony world? Each forest contains a grove with a Heart Tree. Probably knows Everlily Nyx.
