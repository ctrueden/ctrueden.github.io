Vadril's research being halted caused a hiccup in the Syndicate's plans. They wanted the results of his research for some purpose. They are hoping to inspire him to complete his research somehow, since they feel no one else is capable of finishing what he started.

He's being groomed to program the Deus Ex Machina (Emmanuel Jr.), a machine intelligence capable of being merged with Luna. His work is vital to the creation of such a program. What was he about to discover?

Who was Vadril's father? He probably worked with Noonian Soong on the LORE chip. Could Soong be Vadril's father or grandfather? (Obviously the royals must change last names at some point or they'd all have the same one.)
