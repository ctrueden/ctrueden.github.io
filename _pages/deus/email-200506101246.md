Hi everyone,

Allen asks:
&gt; Will Psyons be able to sense each other?

Mystics and psions do not sense each other innately, but can use
divination to do so. However, divination can also be used as a counter
to shield you from being sensed.

On the technological side, there are devices capable of sensing
mystics regardless of whether they are currently using their
abilities. There is no well-known mystic effect to fool these devices,
although of course an EMP or something of that nature could disable
them. Psions are not detected by the devices unless the psion is
actively using an effect.

The devices function by analyzing particles in the air near the
individual. The mystic's connection to external mystic energy causes a
reaction observable to the device. Psions do not cause such a reaction
because they do not interact with ambient mystic energy, but instead
draw their power from within.

Lastly, the devices can also sense Gaians (any race with a connection
to Gaia, including halflings, elves, pixies, dryads, and many other
things from the MM or SS).
