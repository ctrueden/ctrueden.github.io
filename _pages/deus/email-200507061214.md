Hi everyone,

Crap, I forgot to grant edit permission to each of you for your own
Player page. I notice that some of you already edited your public or
private character page to indicate your scheduling preference.

I have now granted edit permission to your Player page, which is where
the scheduling preference should be listed. Oz and Nate, I will update
your Player page to match what you wrote on your character page. Sorry
for the trouble!
