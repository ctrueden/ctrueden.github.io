<br>Subject: website feedback

Hi everyone,

I have recently learned that at least one person did not receive any
of the last four emails I sent out (I am aware that many of you did
receive them, however). Supposedly, Hotmail ate them. I am hoping this
situation has not occurred with anyone else, but if you think you have
missed any emails, please let me know. Before this one, I sent one
private email to each of you with your login information, and three to
the group about the website (initial announcement, confirmation of
login information emails being sent, and correction regarding the
player pages not allowing edits from you guys).

I have not gotten feedback from many of you about the site, but when I
pestered people I've learned that some of you couldn't figure out how
to edit things. If that's the case for you, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I want
you to use the site. I do not want people to sit in the corner,
hugging their knees as they rock back and forth crying silently.

Please, don't be shy about asking if you are confused about anything.
The bulk of the campaign information and planning is shifting to the
website in preference to email, so if you don't understand the site,
it will be a big problem.

Thanks,
-Curtis
