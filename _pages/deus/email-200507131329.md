<br>Subject: player preferences for scheduling

Hi everyone,

I realize that most of you have preferences regarding other players
with whom you would prefer to game. Rather than using the wiki to
communicate such information, please email me with a list of any
people you'd like in your group, or not in your group. I will do my
best to take people's preferences into account. If I don't hear from
you, I will assume you have no preference.

Thanks,
-Curtis
