<br>Subject: action points

Hi everyone,

I have been mulling over the number of action points each character gets and have decided that 3 + 1/2 character level per session becomes ridiculous at higher levels. So I am changing it from this point forward to a fixed 3 action points per session, period. This way, as the game goes on the choice whether to use an action point in a given scenario remains meaningful. Note that each action point still becomes more potent as levels increase (from 1d6 to 2d6 to 3d6, as well as gaining additional versatility through abilities for which action points can be spent). Lastly, the option to buy additional action points using merit points is now available, for 2mp per action point. If anyone has strong objections to this change, you're welcome to try and convince me I'm an idiot.
