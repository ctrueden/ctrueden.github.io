<br>Subject: joint session on nov 30

Hi everyone,

We are moving forward with a joint session between the Monday and Wednesday groups, on Wednesday, November 30. The session will take place downtown at the Computer Sciences building. We will be meeting in the entryway outside the DoIT Tech Store at 6:20pm, and heading upstairs at 6:30. Each group needs a bit of prep time, so I will be employing a co-GM to run one of the groups, while I run the other, until both are synchronized.

James, if you are available on that date, it would be great if you could help out. If not, Paul will act as a GM for that session.

Oz, if two conference rooms are not available, I will take one of the groups to Union South until they are up to speed.

Anyway, I hope you all can make it.

-Curtis
