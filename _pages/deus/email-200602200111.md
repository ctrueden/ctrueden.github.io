Hi everyone,

The next Wednesday session will occur this Wednesday, February 22nd at 6:30pm at my place, as scheduled.

The conclusion of the Monday/Saturday joint affair (another two-parter) will take place this Friday, February 24th at 6:30pm, once again at the Big Abode. I do not anticipate the session going as late as last time, since everything has already been set in motion, and there will be less to resolve.

See you then.

-Curtis
