Hi,

The next Wednesday and Saturday session (#16) is the joint one, this coming Friday, May 26, at 6:00 pm, at the Computer Sciences building on campus.

The next Monday session (#17) is scheduled for Memorial Day, May 29. There is a request that it be moved from that day to two weeks later, June 12. Would that work for everyone?

Thanks,
-Curtis
