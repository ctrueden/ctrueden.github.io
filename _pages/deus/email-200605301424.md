<br>Subject: session 17 &amp; 18, bonus MP

Hi,

Only two sessions left. Here is the schedule for the rest of the campaign:

Saturday: June 3rd, 2:00 pm
Monday: June 5th, 6:30 pm
Wednesday: June 7th, 7:00 pm
Final session: Saturday, June 17th, 1:00 pm, C.S. building

Also, I have awarded bonus MP based on the amount of experience you each have. Check your Experience and Announcements page to find out how many bonus MP you have to spend. In addition, most of you will very likely end up with one additional bonus MP for the final session (meaning that when you hit level 13, you'll effectively get 6 mp instead of 5 mp).
