Hi everyone,

I want to express my gratitude one more time to everyone who participated in the campaign. It has been a blast.

Anyway, I have changed the permissions on the web site to allow everyone access to all the GM pages. Please note well the &quot;last updated&quot; date for each page, because some of them (&quot;character secrets&quot; pages in particular) are very out of date, obsolete, or containing ideas that we did not end up fleshing out. In other words, please realize that I was not able to keep everything in our notes completely in sync with what turned out to be &quot;campaign canon.&quot; When in doubt, ask.

Also, the change I made only affected pages that were &quot;GMs only&quot; pages. I am currently too tired/lazy to go through and reset each of the private character pages. I will do it soon, however, so if you are interested in any particular character's private page, check back in a few days and it should be open. Lastly, if there is any particular page you care to read that does not seem to be accessible, please let me know and I will fix it.

See you space cowboys.

-Curtis
