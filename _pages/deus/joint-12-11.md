Issues to deal with:
* Extraction of Dave's character from Matt's body:
    * Zuul does it quickly, but during the procedure Zuul receives an order from Adana Cassenti insisting that Matt leave at once.
* Deal with Nikolai (he can't stay at Magitech):
    * Magitech refuses to be associated with anyone involved in the Lupan terrorist incident until it has been fully resolved.
* Whether Brice can make it onto DEE, and if so, what he finds out:
    * He does make it there, but DEE immediately demands that he leave.
    * If Brice does not comply, DEE teleports everything off the ship and into space, except Cain, who he flushes out the airlock.
    * Outside the ship, DEE battles with two other ships (experimental elven ships -- formed of living polymers, with sticky appendages that stick to DEE and deliver an powerful EMP bursts -- DEE is disabled but he uses Miller2 to reactivate himself and destroy them)
* Vadril Korlax gets sucked into Eddie. This fulfills the prophecy, and Eddie can be the inspiration he needs. Through some adaptation, Eddie can be used as the AI to drive the Deus Ex Machina.
* The political fallout of the combined party's actions in the Lupus mysticport:
    * Earthquakes on Lupus due to Eddie's plunge through the planet.
    * Merlin Huntington wants to take things slowly and discuss them, but requests everyone involved be present.
    * He wants to know if the terrorist was really Harry Bryant, and what his beef was.
    * David Crowe is there as the UNF representative, and blames Cohen for what happened. He is offset by Huntington, who is much more understanding.
    * If the prophecy comes out, Huntington volunteers to attend the ritual.
* Contact from Jonathan Cohen regarding Max's message.
    * &quot;Ben, Thank you for your message. I have suspended Harry Bryant's corporate privileges until I can personally investigate these very serious allegations. Sincerely, Jonathan Cohen.&quot;
* Hunting down Harry Bryant:
    * After several teleports, he has burrowed into the ground in a crackhouse in Lunar City.
* Verification of the Crown's authenticity:
    * Zee's possible transformation into Coyote.
* Growth of Max Cohen's hand.

What's next for Saturday:
* Contact from Nald Pipwhistle about the white substance and its properties.
* Vadril Korlax's research inspiration: DEE, or Serra?
* Huntington's plans for them?
* Contact from Jasmine? What is she up to? Is now a good time to work her story in?

What's next for Monday:
* Dealing with DEE's assault on Luna:
    * Does DEE awaken Serra? If so, how?
* Recovering Cain's body from space.
* Dealing with Emilio Falconi and the Syndicate's mass suicide on the night of July 21st.
* Follow-up from Erik Lensherr regarding Divin's response to his offer for employment.
* Possible follow-up from Ariona regarding Deblin Gaddelsmocks.
