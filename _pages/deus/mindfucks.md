The flow of the campaign reveals truths (and lies) in an order designed to maximize the intensity and number of shocking revelations both in and out of game. The [GMs Only](game-masters-only) section, on the other hand, just tells it like it is. To reconcile this discrepancy, this page explains the order of revelations we plan to use to keep stringing the players along. (:mrgreen:)

[Fearful](fearful) / [Destroyer](universe-creation) / [Destiny Force](universe-creation) path:
* A colony has disappeared without a trace, for reasons unknown.
* A strange planet with Earth-like biological life is discovered!
* Exploring the planet, it seems to be alive somehow, and either wishes to help or harm the Terrans exploring it (depending on what they do, and how overtly mystic they are).
* The ecosystem itself is actually an alien intelligence: the [Fearful](fearful).
* The alien virus has infected the Terrans, and they get glimpses into its mind.
* Once the alien(s) is aware of the Terrans, and learns they are the ones propagating mystic energy, it/they ceases all communication after sending a final dire warning that we will be destroyed for our sins (also, phrases like &quot;Have you heard the screams?&quot; and such).
* The aliens use a doomsday device on one of our colonies, obliterating it in a big explosion; it must have been the aliens who were responsible for the disappearance of the first colony.
* But the explosion doesn't match what happened at the first colony; and why were the aliens friendly at first? It doesn't add up.
* While engaged in a conflict with the aliens, the true threat -- the [Destroyer](universe-creation) -- appears to destroy another colony. The aliens freak out, and after calming down, essentially say &quot;I told you so&quot; to the Terrans.
* The PCs learn more about the Destroyer somehow.
* Somewhere in here, the PCs find out about [Dragonstar](dragons) and the [Destiny Force](universe-creation) too.
* Around this point, they learn that the Fearful are responsible for humanity's existence on Earth, as well as how the Fearful took part of Earth's ecosystem to sustain itself.
* They continue to learn more about dragons, and the story of how Gaia was saved 65 million years ago.
* They learn the story of how the universe was created.
* Epilogue: Humanity's descendants have evolved so far that they are barely recognizable. They now dump the waste product from their latest energy source into the black hole at the center of the galaxy (it's the ultimate trash can!). Things go horribly awry, though, resulting in the galaxy's destruction and the creation of our own recursive universe (with flip-flopping parities: the next universe is antimatter-based, and the one after that is matter-based again, but the distinction is essentially meaningless).

Earth is missing:
* When returning to Earth after hearing it might be in danger from the mystery planet (Dragonstar), they find it's gone!
* Actually, the Caretaker and Glaurung had a showdown.
* Glaurung ultimately left again, but the Caretaker studied his dimensional skipping technique, and followed him!
* What are the ramifications for Earth if the Caretaker does this? Can the Caretaker prevent everything from freezing up? Earth isn't equipped to deal with that regularly like Dragonstar is. The Caretaker must have a ''very'' good reason for following.

Fragments, ideas and questions (answers to many of these questions should be posted to the appropriate character secrets pages):
* FAKE FOURTH GROUP: Bill, Justin, Joel, Aaron, Fae, Eric
* Something with Everlily Nyx and William Moss. What have they been doing for the past 174 years?
* Allen's character needs a name, and we need more details on his faction of the Syndicate (what they were doing, whether they are still trying, etc.)
* Malcolm needs to find out that his God is actually the Caretaker and that his colleagues are fictional (sort of).
* What has the Arcane Order been up to? What about Gaia's Ancient Order? There are still two factions there, as well. Could that be linked to the Syndicate's factions?
* Do the royals have any more sinister purpose than just advancing science, technology and mysticism? What about Xela? Did she find a way to preserve her life? What about Gerald?
* What about Pandora's Box? How were the Fearful involved in the creation of Trenton? What is his true history?
* Who in Mercabah is behind the creation of D.E.E.? Who would have the power to keep knowledge of the project from Max Cohen?
* What do Matt's nanites do? Does Zuul has any secret plans for her &quot;son&quot;?
* Has Ian Thorpe gotten involved with any powerful mystics from Pax? Erica Banyon? Would she even want such a &quot;treatment&quot;? Maybe not... What about Boris? Probably a little too paranoid. Most of the others are dead... Could William Moss's mystic abilities be failing? After all, he didn't have them naturally. Maybe he's getting treatments from Thorpe to continue some kind of really important work, and it's slowly killing him.
* Did someone sabotage Devin's experiments on himself? Who would want to cripple Devon and turn him into the monster that he is now? Maybe the same scientist who abducted the scientist who made the breakthrough in genetically engineered mysticism...
* Who is experimenting on Zee? What are they trying to do to/with him? How did he escape? What is the extent of his abilities?
* What is the nature of Noun's divine grammar fragment? Is it from the Destiny Force itself? How did he end up with it?
* What happened to Adam McLean? What happened between him and Max Cohen on Mercury? Who has the third Occultem Lapidem fragment?
* What happened to the 10,666th HHEP? It's crazy, but could it somehow be the missing Occultem Lapidem fragment?
* We are setting up Rae as a possible antagonist at first, making it appear that she was somehow responsible for the colony disappearance. Eventually her name will be cleared. Dragonstar will become more directly involved, and people will probably visit it. Will Rae have to confront her mentor? Will her kin try to force her to return to the planet?
* Do Ariona and Andrew have any common elven acquaintances?
* How exactly is Brice supposed to save the universe? Something about his powers is incredibly profound... is he linked to Noun somehow? Or are their abilities different? Maybe they could ''merge like in Dragonball Z OMG just shoot me now ok I am done writing these little blurbs for now *sigh*''
