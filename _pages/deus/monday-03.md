Mon hears the news that Mercury plunged into the sun during the six day downtime. U.N. Forces announces the truth about Mercury -- that it was gooed, but that they successfully defused this volatile situation.

Cain's body must be whole for him to awaken. Moss wants to cleanse the body and the hand separately, then put them back together to revive him. But the vampires want to rejoin the hand before he is cleansed, to revive him as their lord.

The vampires agree to aid Moss and Mon in recovering Cain's body. But once the body is recovered, the vampires betray the party and take it for themselves.

Moss is counting on Evan and Adana not expecting his alliance with vampires. He has kept his association with them very close, teleporting them directly into and out of his sanctum to conceal the nature of his experiments.

The body is stored in basement sublevel 7 of Magitech HQ in Pax Artificium. The door to the laboratory containing it says &quot;Project Genesis&quot; on it. Moss knows it is there, but the area is very heavily protected against him specifically. To counteract the wards, Moss has a &quot;mystic key&quot; in the form of an old brass skeleton key. To use it, one must channel mystic energy into it, something the vampires cannot do, being undead. But the vampires are physically powerful, and could take out any guards they might encounter.

There are four vampires working with Moss, who are sent with the party. Angelique du Coudray (a beautiful but arrogant woman), Kimi (Algonquin for &quot;secret&quot;) Eagle Talon (Gangrel-style -- cat eyes, all teeth pointed), Petrov Zarkovsky (Nosferatu-style -- hideous to behold), Hunter Savage (modern urban vampire -- good-looking man dressed in a horizontally striped shirt with khaki pants).

Moss tells the party that these four people will be accompanying them, and will be able to assist in access, especially in case anyone physically challenges them.

Brice can overcome computer security. The mystic key Moss gives them bypasses mystic security. Jasmine's luck will assist them.

Moss can't go himself because he knows they have anti-him-specific protections in place, in addition to the normal protections the key affects.

Ariona will be useful to get past the elven DNA scanners. Maybe Ariona, as a half-celestial, has a tiny piece of Emmanuel in her that can speak to her to guide her (an inner voice?).

Moss pushes for DEE to go as well, partly because he wants to get rid of him. A test for whether he can be trusted? And DEE has some useful functions to offer, including miller2.

Meechum could go due to his interest in genetics, and knowing that Cain has been altered by Emmanuel.

The crown is also in the Magitech vault. (Erica has the flute.) They also find some useful clay down there. If they continue pilfering, they find some roller blades (Lefty's -- that port the wearer). There are also some more dangerous things: a canteen labeled &quot;biohazard -- do not open&quot; inside a safe labeled &quot;quarantine&quot; (the Great Healer's pathogen).

The above section contains goods; another section contains living beings. There is a woman in a cage in chains -- a werewolf, but not in were form. She doesn't speak -- she is mute. She seems feral. She becomes a wolf when any sunlight hits her whilst standing on surface of the moon. For some reason, she cannot control her transformations. She is also immune to mystic energy (and hence cannot be put into stasis), which is why she is chained up down here. Adana takes care of her personally (she has taken to calling her &quot;Meera&quot;). The reason for her ailment is that she is the first natural werewolf born on the moon -- and also Luna's first creation.

There is also a blackguard down there, who has used the ability wherein one of his fingers is hidden far away, and thus he cannot die. But the blackguard is sealed down there, in stasis, to keep everyone safe from him -- this stasis chamber is labeled &quot;Mordred.&quot;

Another option is that they go after Zee. DEE can compute where Sat + Zee ended up. It will take hours, but eventually knows the coordinates, and can prepare to transport everyone there.
