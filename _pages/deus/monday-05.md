Events:
* Take Cain's stasis chamber back to Moss, to perform the ritual.
    * The vampires go with them.
    * Nyx tries to sneak in behind the party. (They get Senses rolls to detect her sneakitude.)
    * Moss immediately moves the sanctum.
    * The PCs maybe talk to Moss about abandoning the sanctum -- Moss refuses to do so until the ritual is complete -- what do the PCs do?
    * Nyx appears and pleads with Moss not to proceed. She refuses to leave the sanctum, and Moss cannot kick her out (she passes the Will save).
    * Moss takes down the wards preventing mystic energy from cutting through the chamber.
    * The chamber is opened with a diamond cutting torch, or mystic energy, or something.
    * Nyx is extremely upset, but surprisingly does not try to steal the hand before it gets reattached. (Her plan is to act later, once Cain awakens.) The vampires watch her warily anyway.
    * Once the chamber is opened, the hand is reattached as Moss prepares to begin the ritual.
    * The vampires jump Moss while he is concentrating on the ritual, but before it is started in earnest. Cain is awakening.
    * Cain grabs Angelique and devours her.
    * Nyx grabs Cain, and shouts &quot;Now, Luna!&quot;
    * Cain and Nyx are sheathed in verdant green energy, and Luna throws Cain upwards, through the sanctum ceiling, through the bubble, off the moon, and into space.
        * DEE can compute and potentially affect the vector of Cain's movement. He cannot alter Cain directly, because Cain is alien in nature, and immune to miller2. But he can alter Nyx's trajectory... if he acts quickly and rolls well, he can save Nyx. Otherwise, she becomes a servant of Cain (he forces her to drink his blood, allowing him to command her later -- she resumes her service to Luna, but now there is Cain's evil within her). Also, DEE figures that Cain, on his current course, will impact Mars in approximately 10 days' time.
* The sanctum destroyed, Moss runs off, muttering about it no longer being safe. If they shout for him to wait, he tells them, &quot;Bugger off, you!&quot;
* They now have to track down Cain, but first acquire a weapon capable of subduing him. They need the legendary weapon Longinus's Spear (Excalibur, Mjollnir, etc.) -- one of seven major artifacts, along with Nebuchadnezzar's Crown (Crown of Swords, etc.), Babylon's Horn (flute, etc.), Ambrosia (forbidden fruit, Snow White's poison apple, etc.), Pandora's Box (Ark of the Covenant, the Obelisk, etc.), [Shroud of Turin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin), and Odin's Eye (Cain's Hand, Medusa's Head, etc.). The number of artifacts corresponds to the number of destiny fragments (Noun, Verb, Atom, Operator, and the three pieces of the Conjunction/Operator).
    * Who would know how to defeat Cain?
    * Someone who was there at the time...
        * The Caretaker
        * Someone else ancient (Xela)
        * Someone with extensive arcane knowledge (Erica Banyon)
        * A vampire hunter -- the von Helsing family, descendants of Arthur, would know of the sword. It was once in their possession, but they have since lost it.
