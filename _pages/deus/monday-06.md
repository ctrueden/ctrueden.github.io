Events:
* DEE is contacted by Admiral Rossner, a member of the UNF, who has some pointed questions about the events relating to the &quot;Cain being thrown off the planet&quot; incident.
* Ensure that 10ish days pass. Cain Mars confrontation must be on Sunday, June 25, or later (due to Wednesday's interaction with the rogue planet on June 23-5).
* They travel to Midgard to speak with Xela about obtaining the Spear. Xela has been unable to draw the weapon from the stone in which it is entrenched. She is willing to allow the party to try, in exchange for a future favor (especially if they save Nyx and make it clear that she owes them -- and if Nyx is present she will vouch for them and promise the favor herself).
    * Brice and Nikolai are both capable of drawing the sword -- or Jasmine if she happens to be there. If one of the Calculus individuals draw the sword, it is sheathed in dark energy. If Brice draws it, it is sheathed in holy energy.
* They travel to Mars with the sword to battle Cain.
    * Come up with a compelling reason to use DEE for the trip to Mars, instead of just porting there. Perhaps Nyx wants to conserve her magic. (Would Xela agree to port them there?) But that must be balanced against the urgency of the situation.
    * When traveling to Mars, perhaps they are set upon by pirates. Who are they, and did destiny have a hand?
