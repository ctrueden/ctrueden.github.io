### Max

Max has been given a data crystal containing some of Vitto's personal communications from 8-9 years ago. [[To his trusted bodyguard and friend Emilio: &quot;M: It's worse than I thought -- Bryant's got his fingers in everything, and he's even got people starting to believe his bullshit. We gotta talk him outta it. Tell B to meet us outside the restaurant in three hours. -V&quot; Later, in person, Vitto remembers: &quot;But what if he doesn't listen, boss?&quot; &quot;He'll listen. I'll fuckin' make him listen. And if he doesn't... we's'll take care of 'im ourselves, and soon.&quot;] The Caretaker instructs Max to befriend Vitto, help him remember his past, and help restore him to the position that was once his, but is now held by Harry Bryant. In addition, Xela instructs Max to do everything he can to induce his new &quot;friends&quot; to recover her Crown as quickly as possible (she is hoping to use it as a bargaining chip to gain additional privileges from the Caretaker). If they won't cooperate, he is to report back to her for additional instructions within two weeks' time.


### Nikolai

He is visiting Gaia's Order on Earth every few days, to check on the status of the Deus rite. Xela has learned that Nikolai has checked in, and plans to do so again. Thus, she sends two spellbreakers (Vargan Foamblower, dwarven, and Penelope Pandemonium, gnomish) and two mystics (Himpur Darkeye, dwarven, and Rudolfo Marvel, gnomish), along with Max, to confront him.

If Nikolai tries to teleport away, one of the spellbreakers counters it with his crystalline longsword. If he tries to Void Step, it is also countered, but the longsword shatters, impaling the dwarf with hundreds of shards.

Penelope, speaking for the group, demands that Nikolai report on the status of the Crown. When he admits that it is not in his group's possession, she agrees to allow them a bit more time, but insists that &quot;one of us&quot; (Max) join the group to make sure their goals are being pursued. Alternatively, they are asked to surrender the Sword immediately, with the understanding that the lantern has been forfeit.

Also, if Nikolai consults Gaia's Order or the Caretaker again about the Deus rite, he is informed that Bryant is no longer trustworthy, and the Crown should be secured from him -- at the least, his guaranteed cooperation should be arranged somehow.

If Nikolai attempts to establish communications with the Void, he sees a vision of demon scientists feeding mystic energy into a black hole, and terrible feeling of impending doom. An explosion (nova, supernova, hypernova, ultranova), and billions of lives forfeit. It is unclear whether this is the future or the past, but Nikolai gets the impression that mystically awakening consciousnesses is an unfathomably dangerous practice. When questioned about what the Void wants, Nikolai realizes its goal is not to destroy everything, but rather to snuff out psionic consciousnesses awakened by mystic energy.

Nikolai also receives a prophecy from the Caretaker's miller2 experimentation (see DEE below): &quot;True understanding lies cloaked in shadow, known only to he who stands for nothing.&quot;


### Vitto

Bryant has engineered that over a 24-hour period (one night worldwide: July 22nd), a large number of Syndicate operatives die.

Vitto and Max investigate and discover this, but not in time to stop it.

Vitto's father, Sergei (unless Allen was given another name previously) -- he believes that Vitto was a slacker. He did not know that he was actually working for his own son within the Syndicate. He attempted to take his son's life because of lies told to him by Bryant, to manipulate him. According to Bryant, Vitto died a traitor to the family.

Vitto's mother, Yolanda -- she is bossed around by Vitto's father. He brings home money, she doesn't question from where. She is largely ignorant, though not stupid. She still believes her son is dead, killed in a drug deal gone bad.

Vitto's bodyguards, Emilio and Bianca Falconi -- they betrayed Vitto so that Bryant could kill him. Vitto did not know they were involved (they were specifically supposed to not do so -- anyway, Vitto always thought Bianca was a lesbian, and Emilio had an endless string of unserious girlfriends). Bryant played their desire to induce their betrayal. They have since gotten married.

One of the bodyguards, Bianca, is a sacrificialist, but not Emilio -- he chickens out and runs. He has heard about Vitto's return, and runs to his former boss to spill the beans on the plan (on July 21st).

Most members of the Syndicate have been infected with a timed nanitic poison. Emilio does not know, however. He dies on the same day as everyone else.


### Ariona

She is emailed by Deblin Gaddelsmocks, imploring her help in proving her innocence, and riddling her once again with crazy conspiracy theories -- in particular, her latest theory is that StratCo conspired to ruin her and her husband Barclay Pipwhistle -- she just still isn't sure why, to what end. But she &quot;knows&quot; they had some diabolical reason, and wants to find out what it is (since she's still a journalist at heart).

&quot;Dearest Ariona, You may remember me my name is Deblin Gaddelsmocks..  my career has been ruined by the Magitech/StratCo industrial complex, those bastards. Though I haven't figured out how yet! Please, you were there, you know the Bernstein kidnapping wasn't a &quot;publicty stunt&quot; and that they covered it up after the fact!!  I am not guilty of evidence planting I am the only one who sees the truth here-why won't anyone else listen to me?? My husband has been framed as well and now both of us cannot find work anywhere and he blames me for everything since he would never have been investigated if I wasn't such a &quot;lunatic&quot;. *cry* Well anyway I have to find out what is going on with StratCo/Magitech I think they got nervous that I was too close to the truth but there has got to be more going on too. Please if you know anything, help me. Deblin&quot;

Of course, Ariona can only follow up on this lead if she actually can check her email...

Evan Cassenti would agree to see her, although he is emotionally distant (although it would upset Vondre Willowtree). However, Evan probably will not tell her the truth regarding the Gaddelsmocks/Bernstein kidnapping incident. If Ariona continues to investigate, Anat (who ostensibly went with Evan during the split) is dispensed to perform damage control.


### Meechum

If DEE arrives anywhere with mystic energy, Moss immediately ports to the ship and requests that his energy rifle and mystic sensor be returned to him. He explains that his resolve is weakening and his time is short, but that his problems are something that he must deal with on his own. If Monday will not turn over the items, Moss takes them by force.

Meechum immediately senses Moss's nearby presence, and feels strongly drawn to him. He orders Meechum to continue protecting Cain until the Deus rite can be completed. &quot;I sacrificed everything for this,&quot; Moss says. &quot;I may call upon you later, once the rite has been successful. Until then, concentrate on mastering your abilities.&quot;

The experiments conducted by Pandora's Box in the past yielded many &quot;failures&quot; over the years. Many of these people ended up at one &quot;Institute&quot; or another (one of which Dr. Peters worked at). In fact, Peters himself is the result of one of these experiments. Many of these mutants have banded together recently under new leadership -- a former human named Erik Lensherr. He informs Meechum of their respect for his work, and their desire to continue advancing themselves toward perfection. Lensherr seeks to recruit &quot;Merrideth&quot; into their fold as head genetic researcher.

&quot;Dear Dr. Merrideth,

My name is Erik Lensherr. I am the leader of an organization pursuing goals quite similar to your own. We of the Brotherhood have been altered genetically, many of us in ways society at large considers 'undesirable.' But we have realized the truth: that we represent the next step for humanity, and we have continued to investigate techniques to improve ourselves genetically and otherwise.

Our people greatly respect your work, and we feel that you would be the ideal choice to head up our newly formed human genetic research team. If you are interested, I would like to meet with you as soon as is convenient to discuss the details, including your salary. As our goals closely coincide with yours, since we are both pursuing perfection,  I certainly hope you will consider my offer.

Sincerely,
Erik Lensherr
Brotherhood of Homo Sapiens Superior&quot;


### Eddie

He hears the psionic echoes from Nikolai's Void Step and freaks out. He also works with the crew to improve things and promises to build various gadgets for people.


### Brice

He learns that Eddie is a computer of sorts, and figures out how to &quot;access&quot; him. His processing power is minimal, but he has an amazingly large amount of internal storage. Brice uncovers reams of data collected a very long time ago (thousands of years -- from ~6500 BC).

If the others entrust Brice to the task, he may be able to determine that some of them (Ariona, Meechum) have net messages waiting.

Brice has also received a response from Jasmine. &quot;Dear Brice, I am learning many new things, and I am starting to feel more confident. I am continuing to lie low until I am more capable of evading the anyone who might come after me. Somehow it seems as though I am preparing for something really big, although I'm not yet sure what... How have you been? Has anything big and exciting happened since the last time we talked? I'm looking forward to seeing you again some day soon. ttfn, J.&quot;

Brice also receives a prophecy from the Caretaker's miller2 experimentation (see DEE below): &quot;The union of order and chaos yields tragedy... revolution... and catharsis.&quot; [[Referring to a possible child born of the Divine Verb and Divine Operator bringing great change -- it could grow (or be made to grow) much more quickly than a normal child, like Mordred from Arthurian legend. Later, it could free Mordred, claiming they are kindred spirits.]


### DEE

The Caretaker has been experimenting with miller2, attempting to use it in conjunction with the miller &quot;prophecy&quot; algorithm. As a result of one of these attempts, certain newly uncovered arcane tidbits of information have been sent to various people -- electronically, but transcending network limitations (the Caretaker is intrigued by this development and wishes to harness miller2's potential to send electronic messages to anyone, anywhere -- although it has not fully deciphered how to do so yet).

DEE is one of those affected. In DEE's personal mailbox, he receives the following prophecy (no date, no sender, no network trace, no server details): &quot;The prophet comes in gleaming steel -- learns the truth, speaks the truth, becomes the truth.&quot;

Brice and Nikolai also receive such a communication (see their sections above).

Vadril also receives a prophecy, telling him about DEE and his location (although in a not-completely-obvious fashion).

Others who receive messages: Noun, the OL, Jasmine, Serra, and possibly others TBD.
