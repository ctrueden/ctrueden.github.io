First, Monday will almost certainly attempt to locate Cain, and potentially reunite with DEE (if they follow the lead from Scorpio's henchman to Lupus).

## Jasmine Crisis
Brice receives a frantic communication from Jasmine immediately after she sends it.  She luckily got off of Lupus after Daniel Ocean left her to die, and made it back to France to her parents. See [Talk20060305](talk-20060305) for Jasmine's complete backstory so far.

## Researching the Void (part 1)
Once they are back in email range, Adana Cassenti tells Monday that the rite has been accelerated, and she needs immediate help continuing the research into alternative ways to stop the Void. She has her hands more than full trying to rebuild her city right now. More below.

## Syndicate Suicide
Emilio pressures Vitto into a meeting in a busy restaurant (not Vitto's family's restaurant) on July 21st.  There, he spills the beans that something terrible is going to happen tonight.  &quot;Remember that thing we talked about?  It's going down tonight.  Your father's in on it.  Everyone's going to die.&quot;  Then, he dies, poisoned.  If Vitto tries to heal him, it becomes clear that Em's soul is just plain gone.  He might find a bug on Em, capable of emitting a signal that triggers a nanitic poison.

Vitto can roll to remember that the catastrophe that he was trying to stop Bryant from orchestrating was not the Mercury incident.  If he rolls well enough, then he'll remember that many Syndicate members are slated to die somehow.

If Vitto confronts his father (his only lead), then his father will tell him that what has been planned cannot be stopped.  &quot;The contracts have already been signed, long ago.&quot;  He'll have one chance to stop his father from committing suicide using the nanites - maybe by healing him as he's dying?  If Vitto prevents his father from suicide, then Abadon shows up and takes the soul.  &quot;The shadows in the room seem to grow deeper and darker, and you hear a faint howling in the distance.&quot;

## Recovering Cain
This will be played very loose, but basically, if they manage to track down Cain (hints that machines are malfunctioning on Laboro will be dropped), then he'll eat Scorpio and not really fight against them, but instead indicate that he sent his man to Laboro, and Freeman hasn't come back yet.  Cain would really like him back, and refuses to go along with them unless they help him.  He can't be teleported in any way (not even with Babylon's Horn -- they'll need a regular ship to get him to Luna), so he wants them to go look in his stead. If they refuse, he'll indicate that he'll show up for the Deus rite when he feels like it, and use force against the party if necessary.  He'll also try to hack Adam (Adam will receive a will save).

## Arcadia NPCs
* Boris Derrota -- kingpin and economic superpower; suspects his brother's agenda and is monitoring him closely; asks the party to watch Josef in exchange for information about Pandora's Children &amp; the Brotherhood
* Annika Derrota -- mysterious and reclusive; see [NPCAnnika](npc-annika) for her history from the Pax campaign; __TODO__
* Josef Derrota -- recently joined Boris's organization; covertly working to topple his brother's empire
* Lincoln Evans -- Samoan drug dealer; big muscly guy, wears lots of jewelry; crosses his arms a lot; outgoing, says &quot;Ayup&quot; and &quot;Nope&quot; a lot in his deep voice
* Norris Harrison -- runs the &quot;pawn shop&quot; (huge block of warehouses; largest concentration of stolen goods in the galaxy); wears a felt hat over his shaved head and constantly adjusts it; reserved, says &quot;Hmm&quot; and &quot;I'll see what I can do&quot; a lot
* Felicia Worthington -- a fence, and one of Boris's informants; plump woman with a mohawk and lots of cybernetic body art; fidgets constantly, probably on drugs; rude, says &quot;Fuck off&quot; and &quot;I ain't payin' for that&quot; a lot 
* Maxim Signaevsky -- __TODO__ WTF was this guy's purpose? If you need a quick name, go ahead and use it
Won a hot dog eating contest in 2287, likes cheap whores.

## Researching the Void (part 2)
This will be fruitless.  They'll find that they can only pull things out of the void if there's some sort of a link remaining to the real world - anything without a link will be lost forever.

## The Laboro Situation
DEE is there.  They might not find him directly, because he'll be phased, cloaked, etc., but they will find his disciples (12 total, 9 left on Laboro), who wear DEE's symbol prominently.  Freeman will be one, and will be the humanlike one.  There will also be a mining machine, a mecha, a scout ship, the Laboro central computer (which can be using Miller 2 to teleport things), and another variety of machines.  If they try to contact DEE, he'll talk to them - his work here is already underway and cannot be stopped, and DEE will be much friendlier.  Adam might be a disciple as well.  The sigil allows the disciples to tap into extradimensional computing power, which lets them awaken things.

## Session 15: Protecting the Deus rite
Monday's role in the Deus rite: stop the New Lunar Order from interfering. This scenario gives Monday (especially Vittorio) a combat. Perhaps the Caretaker has put a shield around the Heart Tree area on Luna, but the Gaians are trying to breach it, and Monday must protect it?

## Session 16: Gaddelsmocks, Pipwhistle, and the job offer to Unity
Gaddelsmocks conspiracy, Pipwhistle / Bernstein research, StratCo white goo, DEO.

Lensherr offered the head R&amp;D job to Meechum because Nald (and Bernstein, a little) was getting too suspicious. Nald could no longer be trusted to keep the faith of the Brotherhood.
