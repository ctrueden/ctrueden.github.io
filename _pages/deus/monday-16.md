## Miscellaneous notes

Vondre' Willowtree makes an attempt on Ariona's life, since they are both at the rite, on opposing sides.

* The Destroyer arrives at Deus rite
    * Echoes resonate with Nikolai somehow?
    * Echoes affect Jasmine very profoundly?
* How do Nikolai and Jasmine end up opening a portal to the end of time?
* Do they travel to near Pluto to investigate the Destroyer more thoroughly?
* Or perhaps Jasmine runs off there?

Does Gaddelsmocks tip off Ariona about DEO? If she dug deeply enough at StratCo, maybe she found out about it? But then maybe StratCo silences her before she can say anything else to incriminate them?
