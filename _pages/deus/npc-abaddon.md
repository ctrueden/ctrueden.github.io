[Abaddon](http://users.aristotle.net/~bhuie/abaddon.htm) is a devil (specifically a [horned devil](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/devil.htm#hornedDevilCornugon)) sent to reap the souls of those who have reneged on their infernal contracts. The souls of those harvested were used to augment the [Oversoul](npc-oversoul) in preparation for the Deus rite.
