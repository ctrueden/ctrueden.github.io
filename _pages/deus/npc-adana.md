Adana is one of [Sara Cassenti's](/pax/pcs/sara) twin children, and [Magitech's](org-magitech) chief executive. She is a regal woman with fine facial structure, brown hair, green eyes and a cool demeanor.

Though opposed to the Deus rite, she ultimately admitted she had no better option and consigned herself to the lesser of two evils. She has had a difficult time dealing with the Deus rite, [DEE's](char-public-griffin) devastation of Pax Artificium, and [Mordred's](npc-mordred) corruption of her ex-husband [Evan](npc-evan).
