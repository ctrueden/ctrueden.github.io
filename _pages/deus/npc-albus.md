Albus became the new head of the [Arcane Order](org-arcane-order) after [Yeslek's](/pax/npcs/yeslek.html) untimely death during the Pax Artificium campaign. He presided over the Order from 2034 until 2299, at which time he died of old age and was succeeded by [Iason](npc-iason).

He practiced a strict policy of non-interference with the outside world, and exiled seven recalcitrant wizards who refused to abide by the rules: [Soren]((npc-soren), [Jendu](npc-jendu), [Tungoa](npc-tungoa), [Sai](npc-sai), [Vixlecais](npc-vix), [Morgan](npc-morgan) and [Aldan](npc-aldan) -- along with their son [Merlin](npc-merlin), who chose to leave with his parents rather than remain on the island).
