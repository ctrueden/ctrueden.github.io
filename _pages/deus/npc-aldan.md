Aldan was one of the seven members of the [Arcane Order](org-arcane-order) exiled for disagreeing with its policy of noninterference in world affairs, along with her husband [Morgan](npc-morgan) and son [Merlin](npc-merlin).

Aldan was slain by [Speed Demon's](npc-moses) elite team of superheroes during World War III.
