Anna was a devastatingly powerful psionic ninja. Once a supervillain, she settled down with [Speed Demon](npc-moses) after the events of Pax Artificium 265 years ago, eventually taking on the superhero persona of &quot;Snow White&quot; and raising two children, [Bullettrain](npc-marcus) and [Finesse](npc-laura). Her superhero costume is simply white ninja garb.

Anna was [an NPC](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/anna.html) during Pax Artificium.
