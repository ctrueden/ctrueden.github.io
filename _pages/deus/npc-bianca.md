A large, muscular woman, Bianca serves as one of [Orlando Garibaldi's](npc-orlando) bodyguards. She is sometimes crass and often short-tempered, but also has a hidden sweet side.

She was part of the [Syndicate](org-syndicate) mass suicide conspiracy, and was forced to kill her own husband [Emilio](npc-emilio) to prevent him from revealing the truth.
