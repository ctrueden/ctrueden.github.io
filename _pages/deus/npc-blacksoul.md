Blacksoul was a roguishly handsome space pirate, and captain of the Obsidian Teknokon. He was a member of Pandora's Children until his death at the hands of [Malcolm](char-public-ozzyie), who also later resurrected him, giving Bernard a second chance at life. Inspired by the miracle, the former captain gave up his life of narcissistic derring-do along with his pirate name in favor of his given one, Bernard Sinclair.
