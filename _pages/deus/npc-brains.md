Brains was one of [Dorian](npc-dorian)'s crew, the Filthy Mongrel's engineer. He was the only one who attempted to help the Perseverance's crew during the hostage situation. He was killed with all the rest when Dorian triggered the subcutaneously exploding nanites he mistakenly thought would kill the hostages.
