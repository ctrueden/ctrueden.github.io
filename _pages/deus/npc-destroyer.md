This strange and profoundly frightening phenomenon has been witnessed several times, and describes the supposed entity responsible for the Percepi colony's disappearance.

The Destoyer has many names. The dragons call this entity the [Beast](http://www.666beast.net/draghead.htm), and believe it eternally hungers to devour their world. [Dancing Cat](npc-dancing-cat), a woman from the &quot;living planet,&quot; mentioned divine punishment from something called the Peacemaker, which could be another term for the Destroyer.

It seems likely that the Destroyer is somehow affiliated with the [Void](npc-void), an all-encompassing nothingness.
