Emilio is a thin, somewhat weasely fellow, often nervous but good with guns. Despite his appearance, however, he has managed to have a continuous string of girlfriends throughout his youth. He is one of [Orlando Garibaldi's](npc-orlando) bodyguards.

He was recently assassinated to prevent him from revealing too much about the Syndicate mass suicide to [Vittorio](char-public-allen).
