Evan is one of [Sara Cassenti's](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/pcs/sara.html) twin children. Within the last few decades, he had a falling out with his wife [Adana](npc-adana), and left [Magitech](org-magitech). After that, he took a position at [StratCo](org-strat-co), and has since become its chief executive.

His activities during that time have been veiled in mystery, but he was recently affected by [Mordred's](npc-mordred) corruption and participated in the Deus rite. Though he and [Gerald](npc-gerald) briefly confronted one another, [Ariona](char-public-alex) begged [Gerald](npc-gerald) not to kill him, and he quickly escaped. Later, the Saturday group staged a trade with him for his ex-wife Adana in exchange for [Zee's](char-public-james) parents [Varick](npc-varick) and [Elsa](npc-elsa), and managed to subdue him during the encounter and revert him to his normal form.
