Gaddelsmocks is a gnomish reporter who entertains crackpot theories about corporate and government conspiracy. Lately she has been pushing the idea that [StratCo](org-strat-co) and [Magitech](org-magitech) are actually the same company, even though in actuality they are bitter rivals. She was recently fired for evidence planting regarding the [Bernstein](npc-bernstein) abduction incident.
