Hernando is the owner of a butcher shop in Arcadia, and [Ponce's](npc-dorian) older brother. Much more prudent (some might say paranoid) than Ponce, Hernando avoids taking unnecessary risks whenever possible, and is always bailing his brother out of trouble, which Ponce does not appreciate.

As a dwarf, Hernando stands 3 feet 8 inches tall. He wears a sombrero that constantly shades his eyes. He has a very obvious gun slung across his back, and a big choppin' knife at his hip. Over everything, he wears a spotless white apron (nanoweave and stainproof). He's a butcher by trade, and is an expert at chopping things up. However, until recently his shop was merely a front for the graft business, with a whole slew of stasis chambers filled with Gaian body parts in his basement.

Hernando's involvement in the graft business was cut short when [Boris](npc-boris) purchased the shop and sent the stock of Gaian body parts back home for proper funeral rites.
