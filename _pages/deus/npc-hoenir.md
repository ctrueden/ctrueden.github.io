[Hoenir](http://www.dickinson.edu/~eddyb/mythology/Hoenir.html) (pronounced &quot;hey-near&quot;) is a soft-spoken royal who greatly values decorum and formality, and eschews rudeness. He is 26th in the royal line of succession. Along with [Alfadir](npc-alfadir), he was involved in [Adam McLean](npc-mc-lean)'s research into the properties of &quot;grey goo&quot; nanites. He has since moved on to new research topics, including studying the ramifications of certain variants of Forterol on mystics.
