Savage is a good-looking &quot;urban&quot; vampire, and a snappy dresser. He is one of the four vampires who were collaborating with [William Moss](npc-moss) and assisted in [Cain](npc-cain)'s retrieval from [Magitech](org-magitech) HQ. He was destroyed by [Gerald](npc-gerald) during the Deus rite confrontation.
