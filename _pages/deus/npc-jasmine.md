title: Jasmine de Vide
category: deus
---
Jasmine is short at only 5' 3&quot; tall with a small frame, and appears in her early twenties. She has wavy, shoulder-length raven black hair and black eyes. Her creamy smooth skin is typical of the genetically engineered masses of today. She usually wears utilitarian clothes -- in particular, her cargo pants contain many pockets containing various useful trinkets and tools. She usually wears an unbuttoned designer jean or polyfiber jacket over her shirt, and keeps her hair tied back in a ponytail. A faint French influence can occasionally be heard in her speech.

She has grown increasingly close to [Brice](char-public-andy) and it seems they are polar opposites in terms of their abilities. Recently, Brice brought her into cyberspace physically with him, at which point Jasmine claimed she could read some kind of hidden writing in the nodes. One node in particular disturbed her, and she became convinced that Brice was fated to die. [Noun](char-public-lucas) confirmed her worries, saying that it appeared Brice had a polar opposite largely responsible for his future death. Jasmine was horrified, but Brice talked her into remaining, saying that if it was fated, there was little she could do, and consoling her that maybe they could find a way around the problem.

Unfortunately, Jasmine herself was taken by the [Destoyer](npc-destroyer) when it appeared at the conclusion of the Deus rite.

She grew up in France, the middle child of five. Her siblings are ValÃ©rie, NoÃ©mi, AimÃ©e and Benjamin. As a result, she was often overlooked and considered nothing special. However, one day nearly eight years ago, she manifested strange powers of probability during a shuttle ride with her parents when a freak accident should have resulted in their deaths.

At first her parents didn't believe her that she had somehow prevented the accident. To prove it, she began to use her newfound abilities to win at gambling -- a lot. Her family disapproved, and eventually none of the gambling establishments would allow her entry.

She had a falling out with her family, and decided to make it on her own. Despite her luck, she became desperate for money, and took a job offer to abduct [Rudolf Bernstein](npc-bernstein). But afterwards, with both [StratCo](org-strat-co) and [Magitech](org-magitech) seemed to have turned their backs on her (with at least one agent of StratCo, [Ron Davis](npc-davis), attempting to incapacitate or kill her), she was forced into hiding, and eventually hooked up with [Daniel Ocean](npc-ocean), a master thief. She traveled to Canis to meet Ocean, and began learning his trade (con artistry and thievery).

Meanwhile, two of her sisters (NoÃ©mi and AimÃ©e) missed Jasmine dearly, and traveled to Canis to visit, since she had let them in on her destination (despite Ocean's caution not to do so). Unfortunately, during their visit, Lupus invaded Canis, and her siblings were killed in the war, as &quot;collateral damage&quot; of the invasion, before Jasmine's very eyes.

Ocean fled Canis during the assault, abandoning Jasmine. Unable to escape, Jasmine nonetheless survived due to her luck.

Betrayed and broken, she sought out her parents for comfort back home (luckily she found a mystic, [Shiela Lewis](npc-lewis), capable of transporting her, who does so for free due to her state of extreme shock, mumbling about home), but her parents blamed her for NoÃ©mi and AimÃ©e's deaths, and they disowned her. Even her baby brother Benjamin gave her a broken, sad look before turning away from her.

Jasmine then turned to the only friend she had left, [Brice](char-public-andy), for help, and did not leave his side until being taken by the [Destroyer](npc-destroyer) at the conclusion of the Deus rite.
