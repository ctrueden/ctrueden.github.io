Jendu was one of the seven members of the Arcane Order exiled by [Albus](npc-albus) for failing to adhere to the Order's noninterference policy. Along with three of the other exiles [Tungoa]((npc-tungoa), [Sai](npc-sai) and [Vix](npc-vix)), he formed [Pandora's Box](org-pandora), a group devoted to bettering humanity's mystic potential through genetic and mystic manipulation.

Jendu and Tungoa produced a son, [Etnia's](npc-etnia) father.
