This man with one hand doesn't remember much about who he was. He claims the last date he remembers is 2050. With [Vadril Korlax](char-public-mike)'s help, he also remembered that [his brother](/pax/pcs/josef) betrayed him, and a [cloaked man](/pax/npcs/healer) healed him. He looks to be about 5' 10&quot;, 130 lbs, with black hair and eyes, and a mixed caucasian and hispanic background. He appears just shy of middle age.

Josef was [an NPC](/pax/npcs/josef) during Pax Artificium.
