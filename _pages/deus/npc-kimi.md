Eagle Talon is a lean, feral-looking vampire with wild hair and claws. Her name means &quot;secret&quot; in Algonquin. She is one of the four vampires who were collaborating with [William Moss](npc-moss) and assisted in [Cain](npc-cain)'s retrieval from [Magitech](org-magitech) HQ. She teamed up with the [New Lunar Order](org-luna) to attack the Deus rite, but managed to escape. Her current whereabouts are unknown.
