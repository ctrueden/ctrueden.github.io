Lefty was a member of [Speed Demon's](npc-moses) elite squad of mystics responsible for defeating the Seven during World War III. Though as a youngster she wore bubble-gum pink and had an attitude the size of a 747, by WW3 she was an old woman. Shortly before she would have died of old age, [Dana Arthur](npc-zuul) unveiled the first line of soulmechs and Lefty quickly took the opportunity to restore her lost youth. Having regained her spunk, she went on to become the president of the [World Mystics Guild](org-mystics) and has held the position ever since.

Lefty was [an NPC](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/lefty.html) during Pax Artificium.
