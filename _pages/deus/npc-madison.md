Madison is [Trenton's](char-public-mark) mother, and for much of her young life one of the test subjects of [Pandora's Box](org-pandora). She and her husband [Felix](npc-felix) set fire to the Pandora's Box compound, made their escape during the confusion, and have lived a relatively normal life ever since.
