Until recently, this woman was locked in Magitech's seventh basement level. When the building collapsed, [Vittorio](char-public-allen) found her dead beneath the rubble.

Shortly thereafter, during the Deus rite, [Selena Sharptooth](npc-selena) called on her in her lunar wolf form to lay waste to the battleground. After the battle, Vittorio managed to stop her rampage by enclosing her in a globe of darkness that blocked the light of the sun from touching her, at which point she passed out and reverted to her human form.
