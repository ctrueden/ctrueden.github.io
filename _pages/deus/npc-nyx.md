[Everlily Nyx](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/nyx.html) is a fierce pixie, and the former head of [Gaia's Ancient Order](org-gaia). After being involved with [Magitech Corporation](org-magitech) for nearly a century, she disappeared from view shortly after World War IV along with [William Moss](npc-moss). She has strawberry-colored hair that she typically keeps spiked upwards, and dresses in light warrior's garb with a tiny rapier at her belt.

She became involved with the [New Lunar Order](org-luna) when it became clear that the [Caretaker](npc-caretaker) was planning to merge [Luna](npc-luna) with [Cain](npc-cain) whether Luna was willing or not, and took responsibility for warning Luna about the impending threat. However, before the Deus rite took place, Nyx was tainted by Cain. When Moss cleansed Cain by taking the undead taint into himself, Nyx's loyalties were transferred as well. After an incident on Earth where she and Moss were attacked by intolerant Gaians, they relocated to Mars where Nyx befriended [Aries](npc-mars), and the three of them established Alexandria, a subterranean necropolis.

Nyx was [an NPC](http://restlesswarrior.com/npcs/nyx.html) during Pax Artificium.
