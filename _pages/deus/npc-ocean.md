Ocean is a master thief. He somehow managed to steal the Crown from [Magitech Corporation](org-magitech), but instead of selling to [Harry Bryant](npc-bryant) as agreed, Ocean double-crossed him and sold to [Mikhael Volokhov](npc-volokhov) for a higher price. Ocean then lurked around Canis for a while, taking in [Jasmine de Vide](npc-jasmine) as an apprentice until the Lupus/Canis war started. He fled the colony, and his current whereabouts are unknown.
