This gestalt entity consists of a fusion of a multitude of previously undead souls that lay dormant within the Sun for millions of years, coupled with nearly a million new additions when the &quot;grey goo&quot; remnants of Mercury collided with them. It was able to return to Earth when a special version of a Gaian heart tree was birthed in flame and planted on Sol. The Oversoul was later merged with Cain, empowering him so that he could be merged with [Luna](npc-luna) during the Deus rite to create [Lilith](npc-lilith).
