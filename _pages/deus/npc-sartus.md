Sartus is one of two elven guardians (the other being [Benek Tolorin](npc-benek)) originally responsible for the protection of [Sara Cassenti](/pax/pcs/sara.html) during the Pax Artificium era. Since the birth of Sara's children, [Adana](npc-adana) and [Evan](npc-evan) Cassenti, Sartus and Benek have pledged to protect them, so that their race can once again grow and prosper. Recently, Sartus's influence has faded over time, until finally with his last remaining strength he saved Adana Cassenti from being impaled upon [Luna's](npc-luna) Heart Tree by [DEE's](char-public-griffin) particle lance.

Sartus was [an NPC](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/npcs/sartus.html) during Pax Artificium.
