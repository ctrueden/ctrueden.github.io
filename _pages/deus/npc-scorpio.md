Scorpio was a Zodiac with secretive and brooding personality traits, one of the &quot;evil Zodiacs.&quot; It escaped from [Magitech](org-magitech) and fled to the asteroid belt, where it became the leader of a large group of space pirates allied with [Pandora's Children](org-children). Scorpio recently encountered [Cain](npc-cain) there and joined forces with him, until Cain decided it was no longer useful to him and devoured its soul.
