Seeker is a mysterious monk who is over 2000 years old. He appears middle-aged, and has sworn a vow of poverty.

During World War IV, he acted as the arbiter appointed by the Caretaker to forcibly end the war before humanity destroyed itself with antimatter weapons. After that, he disappeared, but has recently resurfaced as the [Arcane Order's](org-arcane-order) &quot;go-to guy.&quot;

Seeker has had a very eventful life, having been present during the sealing of magic 2300 years ago, the birth of the Caretaker nearly three centuries ago, and the recent Deus rite.

Seeker is [Paul's fourth character](/pax/pcs/theodolous) from Pax Artificium.
