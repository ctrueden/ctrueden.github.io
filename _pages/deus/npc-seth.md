Seth is the third son of [Adana](npc-adana) and [Evan](npc-evan) Cassenti. He was a researcher and pilot in [Magitech's](org-magitech) space travel research program, and helped develop (highly classified) experimental organic ships. He was sent after [DEE](char-public-griffin), who currently had custody of [Cain's](npc-cain) body, and killed when his craft was largely destroyed.
