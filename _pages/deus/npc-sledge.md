title: Sledge Greenhorn
category: deus

For a troll, Sledge is much less violent than usual. Other members of Gaia's Ancient Order have actually described him as the sweetest troll they have ever met. He is slow to anger (and slow in general, mentally), and does not understand why so many Gaians have become frustrated with the Caretaker recently. He is a member of Gaia's Council, and led the Gaian army against the [New Lunar Order](org-luna) during the Deus rite confrontation.

Sledge carries a large metal club with spikes. When studied carefully, his skin appears to be laced with cybernetic enhancements.
