Soren was one of the seven members of the [Arcane Order](org-arcane-order) exiled for disagreeing with its policy of noninterference in world affairs. He was very forceful, acting as spokesperson for those who wished to &quot;use our powers for the betterment of humanity, as we once did.&quot;

[Albus](npc-albus), the head of the Arcane Order, exiled Soren, along with six other members -- [Morgan](npc-morgan), [Aldan](npc-aldan), [Jendu](npc-jendu), [Tungoa](npc-tungoa), [Sai](npc-sai) and [Vixlecais](npc-vix) -- for &quot;unrepentant disregard for the Order's rules of conduct.&quot;

Soren was later slain by [Speed Demon](npc-moses) during World War III.
