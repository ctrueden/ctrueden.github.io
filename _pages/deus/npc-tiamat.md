Tiamat is the red dragon representative on the Council of Wyrms, presiding over the chromatic dragons. She is far more cunning even than the other chromatic council members, and less likely to embrace solutions offering only short-term gains, but her cruel streak ensures she is nevertheless quick to demand retaliation and punishment in any circumstance.
