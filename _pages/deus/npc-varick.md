Varick is the father of Siegfried Rixmann (a.k.a. [Zee](char-public-james)), and husband of [Elsa](npc-elsa). He and his wife went into hiding before Zee was born to prevent further experimentation on him by Varick's ex-employer, [StratCo](org-strat-co).

Varick is descended from [Ingolf Rixmann](/pax/npcs/rixmann), an NPC from Pax Artificium.
