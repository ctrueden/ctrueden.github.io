The Baron is one of the wealthiest residents of Arcadia, and perhaps the best-informed (apart from [Boris](npc-boris) and [Annika](npc-annika)). He is &quot;old money&quot; left over from the time of the oil tycoons in the 20th and 21st centuries. He is a cunning villain who does not engage in narcissistic &quot;supervillain tomfoolery&quot; such as leaving the room before the hero is confirmed dead.

He is 6' 4&quot; of average build (for that height), and dresses ornately in expensive, sometimes froofy (sometimes more practical, such as for an African safari), clothing. He often wears a monocle that provides various scanning functions and visual analysis, including detection of mystics and non-humans, aura analysis (how strong someone's soul is, how much of a threat they are, etc.) -- all technological.

When [Bullettrain](npc-marcus) began pressing hard for information about [Fey's](char-public-danielle) disappearance in Arcadia, the Baron captured him and held him for a time, sending out feelers into the underground to gauge whether anyone was interested in him. Bullettrain's sister [Strife](npc-strife) responded, and offered to buy her brother's life from the Baron, who graciously accepted (after some haggling).

His compound is protected by vicious attack dogs with laser beams on their heads, and a swarm of angry robo-bees with machine guns.
