Dr. Weiner worked for [StratCo](org-strat-co) with [Varick Rixmann](npc-varick) on a secret project. They decided to try an experimental technique on Varick's unborn son [Siegfried](char-public-james) (&quot;Subject Z&quot;), but halfway through the process Varick changed his mind and ran away with his wife [Elsa](npc-elsa) while she was still pregnant. Weiner, who had a history of alcoholism, quickly devolved into his old habits and lost his job.

He drifted for a bit, then resolved to find Varick and see what had become of the child. He eventually succeeded, and convinced Varick to let him live in their modest household for a time. Weiner studied the boy intently, and quickly realized the experiment had been a total success.

Weiner heard that that StratCo was offering a reward for information on the whereabouts of the Rixmann's, and though it was not his original intent, Weiner saw the opportunity to potentially recover his old job and contacted his former employer. They came for Varick and Elsa while Zee was away on a school field trip, and waited for the boy to return home, but he never did.

Months later, Weiner recognized Zee on the news during his participation the Lupus terrorist incident, and teamed up with Ron Davis to recover their test subject, along with [Matt Smith](char-public-john), who it seemed had been engineered with DNA stolen from StratCo's research database.
