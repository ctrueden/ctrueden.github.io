Dr. Arthur is the lead scientist at [Magitech](org-magitech) specializing in robotics and the mystic applications thereof. While not mystic herself, she still knows a lot about the theory. She is the pioneer behind soulmechs and has continued to innovate. It is widely speculated that she herself is a soulmech, having been alive for at least 250 years, but she never makes public appearances or agrees to interviews, so no one is sure.

Dana Arthur (&quot;Zuul&quot;) is [John's character](/pax/pcs/zuul.html) from Pax Artificium.
