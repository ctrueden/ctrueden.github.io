Although the island has changed a lot over the past 265 years -- instead of huts, the Order has constructed a castle called the Sanctuary in which they all live, around 7 stories tall, with some towers as many as 20 stories in height -- the wizards who reside there have not. Until recently, the wizards enforced a policy of strict noninterference in the affairs of the outside world.

However, since the death of [Albus](npc-albus), the previous Arcane Order head, the focus of the group has changed -- the new leader, [Iason](npc-iason), is more proactive. While he still believes in isolation from the rest of the world (or at least has not claimed the Order should begin meddling directly), he has argued that the Order has a moral obligation to impose sanctions on those who originated from the Order and are misusing their gifts.
