Pandora's Children is a terrorist organization dedicated to the eradication of soulmechs and other &quot;unnatural monstrosities&quot; born of science. They spout propaganda about the purity of the human genome, and have captured and killed hundreds of Gaians, harvesting their organs for use by their members. Their leader is unknown, but their have clear ties to the space pirates in the asteroid belt, with Captains [Strife](npc-strife) and [Blacksoul](npc-blacksoul), along with their respective crews, being known members.
