[Gaia's Order](http://restlesswarrior.com/pax/groups/gaia.html) has evolved a lot over the past 300 years, but still reveres the Gaia half of [the Caretaker](npc-caretaker). The Order has gained a lot of publicity in recent years due to their deployment of a massive arboretum on each mystic colony they call the Great Forests, each of which has an enormous oak at its center that the Gaians call a Heart Tree, which they say will help the planet to prosper. The arboretum on Luna has been complete for over a decade, and the one on Percepi colony was finished very recently. Great Forests on Lupus, Canis, Laboro and Mars are still being planted.
