The New Lunar Order is a splinter group of [Gaia's Ancient Order](org-gaia), consisting of Gaians who believe that [Luna](npc-luna) should be allowed to make her own choices regarding her fate, rather than being forced against her will to undergo a procedure that will fundamentally alter her nature. Prior to [Cain's](npc-cain) corruption of [Everlily Nyx](npc-nyx), the fierce pixie led the New Lunar Order initiative, despite the fact that it destroyed her personal life with [William Moss](npc-moss), who supported the [Caretaker's](npc-caretaker) efforts.
