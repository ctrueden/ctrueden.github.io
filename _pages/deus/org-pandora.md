Pandora's Box is an organization founded by four exiles from the [Arcane Order](org-arcane-order) -- [Jendu](npc-jendu), [Tungoa](npc-tungoa), [Sai](npc-sai), and [Vixlecais](npc-vix) -- with the goal of adapting the human genome to absorb mystic traits from other races without losing cross-species potency. The work continued for decades, eventually being taken over by the grandson of the original founders, [Etnia Gryffinclaw](npc-etnia), and his assistant [Ramses Corsair](npc-ramses).

[Felix](npc-felix) and [Madison](npc-madison) Verner are recent test subjects of the organization. They were severely mistreated, and as a result managed to escape the compound by setting it ablaze. Etnia was killed in the fire, but the other test subjects were in a separate building, and their current whereabouts are unknown.

Their experiences having ingrained them with a deep-set hatred of magic, Felix and Madison told their son [Trenton](char-public-mark) (who represented the culmination of the Pandora's Box research) that magic was evil and needed to be resealed, claiming that the purpose of Pandora's Box was to research how to do so. Only recently did Trenton learn the truth about his parents' organization.
