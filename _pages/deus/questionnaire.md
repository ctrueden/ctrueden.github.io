Please complete the following requirements when developing your character concept on your private character page. It will help the GMs to understand your character better.


### General character information

Please provide a detailed overview of your character. I've listed some ideas for discussion topics below, but please don't feel limited by them in any way. Write about the things that make your character interesting and worth playing.

Ideas:
* character name
* family history and relations
* physical description
* identifying characteristics
* personality
* religious views
* daily habits
* quirks
* likes &amp; dislikes
* occupation
* schooling
* job satisfaction
* hobbies
* friends
* enemies
* greatest achievement
* greatest failure or disappointment


### Character personality questionnaire

Answering the following specific questions will help you to flesh out your character. Please answer each one with a number between 1 and 5, inclusive. Feel free to provide additional comments if you think your answer to a particular question is misleading or needs further clarification. And remember: there is no requirement for your character to be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; -- such choices are entirely up to you.

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
1. Lie to a friend to protect his feelings?
1. Help a frail old woman cross the street?
1. Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible?
1. Give money to a beggar on the street?
1. Seek vengeance if wronged?
1. Steal if he thought he could get away with it?

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
1. Aliens?
1. Karma?
1. Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?
1. Time travel?
1. Equality for all sentient beings?
1. God or other supreme force?

What does your character think about the following statements (1=Strongly disagree, 3=Neutral, 5=Strongly agree):
1. Now that machines are smarter than humans, biological life is obsolete.
1. The Caretaker has no business meddling in our affairs.
1. Those who can wield magic are obligated to use their power for the good of all Terrans.
1. No matter how realistic the programming, machine intelligence is an illusion; thus, machines should not be afforded the same rights as true sentient life.
1. Humanity has been rash in seeding other worlds with mystic energy before fully grasping the ramifications.
1. Technology is more dangerous than mystic energy, and is more likely to destroy us some day.
