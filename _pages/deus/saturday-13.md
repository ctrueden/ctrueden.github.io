## Vadril's escape

The Caretaker notices Eddie when he manifests his will on Luna. He reopens the conduit, and Vadril is given the option to travel through it back to Earth, so that he can be given a new body (his old one was destroyed).

Vadril's lucky coin is gone, though...

The Caretaker also communicates with Vadril, and realizes his inspiration. Though Vadril may want to attempt to duplicate Eddie somehow, the Caretaker claims it must be Eddie himself who is used.

Eddie engages his star drive and runs away. However, he cannot escape now that the Caretaker has reopened the conduit.


## Ambrosia

If Vadril or Max asks the royals about Bryant, they mention the legendary substance that can quench any hunger: Ambrosia.

If they ask Gaia's Order, they learn that each new Heart Tree has grown a fruit. It's possible that the royals also know about the Yggdrasil fruit, if good research is performed.

Gaia's Order has secretly been watering the Heart Tree on the Sun, to keep it alive. The Caretaker did not instruct them to do this, but of course is not displeased.

Zee recalls that the Sun's Heart Tree had begun to sprout fruit immediately before the Oversoul (including Ti Lung) traversed the tree back to Earth.

The fruit is different for each Tree. This one is a &quot;sunberry,&quot; a golden cross between a giant strawberry, raspberry and mulberry.

Zee senses that he is capable of retrieving the fruit. He can stride through Earth's Heart Tree there and retrieve it, if he is first annointed through a Gaian ritual (or possibly other creative solution). If he does not get anointed, the Sun incinerates him, but then he reforms and is capable of existing on the sun long enough to grab the fruit.


## Zee's origins

Upon visiting the sun, Zee has flashbacks to the solar flare, and related memories. See [CharSecretsJames](char-secrets-james).


## Curing Bryant

Max and the party can then feed the sunberry to Bryant. However, the &quot;warehouse&quot; (actually a crackhouse) is currently occupied. One of the trippers is lying on the floor where Bryant's goop is, and slowly being devoured while in a heroin-induced stupor.


## Deus rite/Destroyer attack

Deus rite, Lilith is born, Destroyer attacks, Glaurung returns in the nick of time, Huntington makes his move, then runs back to Lupus.

Huntington tries to approach the Oversoul, but then notices something odd about the Crown he wears. Suspicious, he stops to investigate it mentally, manages to use his magic to block Sulphur/Salt from jumping to the Oversoul... so instead they jump to Max's arm.

Meanwhile, the rite continues, the Oversoul is merged into Cain, and Huntington has missed his chance. Angry, he mutters, &quot;I've been such a fool.&quot; He then takes the Crown and disappears.


## Matt's enemies

Now that he has been seen on television, StratCo sends five units (Units 2, 3, 4, 5, 7) to take him down. See [CharSecretsJohn](char-secrets-john). They also saw Zee on television (before his transformation), and they are to take him into custody as well. They refer to Matt as &quot;Unit Zero&quot; and Zee as &quot;Subject Z.&quot;

The units had traveled to Lupus to follow Matt and Zee's trail. When the party returns there, they'll be waiting.


## The Technofearful

After arriving on Lupus (and after dealing with the StratCo units, who unveil more of Matt and Zee's backstories), it is soon announced that an enemy force (the one that just subsumed Laboro) is approaching the planet, and U.N. Forces have dispatched dozens of ships to join Khan's personal fleet and protect Lupus.
