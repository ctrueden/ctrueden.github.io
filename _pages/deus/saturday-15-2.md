__[[Sat E1]:__
* Storm StratCo headquarters

Bryant shows up to talk them out of it. Where has Bryant been? Perhaps he was on Laboro, investigating a coming plague predicted by the Caretaker shortly before the rite.

He comes back to warn the UNF, who tells Khan and Huntington, who tell the Saturday group. He then proceeds to join the Saturday group when he learns of their suicidal run on StratCo.

The employees and structure of the StratCo HQ are protected by a trio of large-sized [mithral golems](http://d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/golem.htm#mithralGolem) (Str 35, Defense 43, Slam +38).

When there is an emergency (determined by damage sensors, manual specification, or divinatory red flag -- which includes the divination ward around the building being disenchanted, and thus mystic sensors note that something is wrong), all employees are teleported to a top-secret StratCo facility in orbit (officially just a monitoring station), immediately followed by an invocation of miller2 that functions as an antimagic field (waves are emitted that cause visual distortion, nausea, vertigo and hearing loss -- Fort save DC 24 or be [nauseated](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#nauseated) and [deafened](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#deafened); success results in merely being [sickened](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#sickened)). Anything requiring concentration is impossible regardless of saving throw result. The field also disables wireless communication.

The golems are immediately deployed into this zone to apprehend the intruders. If possible, the golems merely incapacitate them. If the challenge is too great or they cannot disable the enemy for some reason, the golems will kill.

In the case of external assault from weapons (such as nukes, antimatter weapons) they have Magitech-style sensors installed to stop WMDs, as is standard in all government (and some corporate) buildings.

In the case of large-scale external attack, the building is equipped with anti-riot cannons that fire a sticky blob of organic polymers. This &quot;foam&quot; substance is their first line of defense, and is designed to completely hinder movement by hardening within 1 round. As an alternate line of defense, they have stasis nets of various sizes. They also have some destructive weapons that would only be used as a last resort.

The building itself is nonconductive, and particularly resistant to fire (heat, lasers, plasma).


## Evan Cassenti

Having escaped the Deus battle, Evan returned to StratCo, where is recovering. He is still affected by the corruption, and it is causing grave harm to his mind, but he could still be saved, now that Mordred is dead.

No one in the company has seen him lately -- he's stayed isolated within his private office.


## Damocles Experiment Omega

Captured by DEE during the Deus rite battle, it will not appear to cause the Saturday group any trouble.
