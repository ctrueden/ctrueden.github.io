## Glaurung returns to Luna
Glaurung adds his might to the Deus Ex Machina; the Destroyer is held at bay, for now.

## Huntington's meeting
Huntington speaks to the party for a bit, then his computer beeps. He has received word from Khan that he must meet, to discuss late-breaking news. He invites the party to enjoy Lupus in all its splendor, and says he will be back within an hour.

## Matt's enemies, Zee's origins
Now that he has been seen on television, StratCo sends five units (Units 2, 3, 4, 5, 7) to take him down. See [CharSecretsJohn](char-secrets-john). They also saw Zee on television (before his transformation), and they are to take him into custody as well. They refer to Matt as &quot;Unit Zero&quot; and Zee as &quot;Subject Z.&quot;

The units had traveled to Lupus to follow Matt and Zee's trail. When the party returns there, they'll be waiting.

Also, Zee still needs to remember [his past](char-secrets-james). He will be able to now, though, because one of the people who shows up to take Matt and Zee into custody is Dr. Holden Weiner, who tells Zee that his parents have been taken into custody, and that he cannot promise their safety unless Zee turns himself in.

If they fight back, the Units and Weiner will attack the magic users with StratCo's enervin/tranquilizer shots (Fort save DC 20 for the enervin, DC 15 for the tranquilizer). Weiner is a level 9 mystic -- Destr 1, Dis 1, Div 1, Enh 7, Heal 1, Kin 7, Mind 9, Trans 1, Res 20 -- so he also throws down Mind effects to stop them from resisting, and then 

## Huntington's return
He tells the party about what is happening to Laboro, and the coming threat (the virus spreads, so the Technofearful do not have to remain on the planet to finish devouring it).

One of the disciples has turned against DEE (due to the Technofearful's influence). Organic life forms on the planet have been infected, and their eyes have become milky white, shot through with tiny circuitry invisible to the naked eye. (Huntington demonstrates it by zooming in on the imagery he has.)

The party has 11 days to prepare for the Technofearful attack on Lupus. (The exact number of days is not known, but estimates predict &quot;less than two weeks, as little as two days.&quot;)
