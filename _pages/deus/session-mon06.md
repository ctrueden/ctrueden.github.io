To refresh everyone's memory, when we last left our "heroes" (more commonly known as [Ariona Cassyon](char-public-alex), [Nikolai](char-public-jon), [Vitorrio Garibaldi](char-public-allen), [Bryce Murphy](char-public-andy), [Meechum](char-public-joey), [Ian Thorpe](char-public-aj), and [DEE](char-public-griffin)), they were joined by [William Moss](npc-moss) aboard DEE (the spaceship, not the robot) in a massively impressive research effort.

The current day is Friday, June 16th, 2299, and the research was geared toward finding a way to disable Cain before he impacts Mars in 9-13 days.  The upshot of their findings is that there are apparently 7 major artifacts in the world.  These are: Longinus' Spear (Excalibur, Mjollnir); Nebuchadnezzar's Crown (the Crown of Swords); Babylon's Horn (the Flute); Ambrosia (forbidden fruit, Snow White's poison apple); Pandora's Box (Ark of the Covenant, the Obelisk); [the Shroud of Turin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shroud_of_Turin); and the Eye of Odin (Cain's Hand, Medusa's Head).

Longinus' Spear is the most likely useful to the party.  Supposedly, in one of its guises, it even cut off the hand of Cain once before -- thus causing the "death" of Cain for the first time.  There are several possible sources of information on the location of the Spear, but the group decides that their first order of business is to question Moss directly.

He's rather vague, noting that he's hungry, but finally says that anyone he could ask that might know anything, he wouldn't trust to answer truthfully.

Meanwhile, Vittorio informs everyone that he needs to be in New York City in three days' time to meet with the man he thinks is his father, [Sergei Garibaldi](npc-orlando).  Meechum is skeptical that this is really very important right now, but Garibaldi points out that his father may be able to be of assistance in retrieving the artifact once we find it.

Meechum grows more and more caustic, arguing that we don't even know where to look for it yet, until he finally mutters to himself, "Meechum, get out here and take a twirl; I can't stand these people anymore.  Uh, did I say that out loud?"  After affirmation, he grows quite worried-looking.  "Meechum?  Where are you?  Meechum?"  He then keels over and clutches his arm in pain, and staggers to his feet again and stomps off.

Garibaldi asks DEE to keep an eye on Meechum, to make sure he doesn't stop breathing or anything.  "Unless asked otherwise, I am aware of everything that transpires on this ship," he replies.  Garibaldi thanks him.

Back to the Spear, Ariona mentions that she might know of someone who could be useful in their search.  She would need to go to Earth, and she would need to go either alone or with one companion at most, Nikolai by preference.  Nikolai agrees, ignoring Garibaldi's pathetic attempts to keep him and Bryce in his presence.

Garibaldi also suggests, and Ariona agrees, that staying within the range of DEE's ship might be a good idea as well, just in case someone throws up an anti-magic field or something.  (Apparently, he used to specialize in that type of thing.)

At this point, Thorpe also mentions that he might have some useful contacts.  When Ariona asks if he will need to go to where his contacts are or whether he can handle it through the Net, he replies that it is already taken care of.

Meanwhile, Meechum is having an out-loud monologue in the med-bay, which no one is privy to except DEE.  (It mainly consists of trying to figure out magic, and whining about where Meechum might be.)  He then begins twitching and collapses, crawling into the corner and huddling there for a while.

Ariona instructs DEE to find a landing site near London somewhere, which he does, and Ariona and Nikolai prepare to disembark.  DEE tries to help poor, animalistic Meechum to get to the food so he will quit shocking the ship.

The other personality of Meechum appears to come to the fore, and queries, "What happened?"  "Just to be passive-aggressive," DEE plays back the feed of what Meechum was doing for the last five minutes.

A significant amount of oddities occur with Meechum, and finally the more coherent side of him searches out William Moss to discuss what is happening to him.  This conversation happens privately.  "Dr. Merredith tells Moss all his secrets, and disinterested DEE listens in."

-----

Ariona and Nikolai visit Ariona's contacts, and come back with some information.  There are at least two different people interested in collecting such artifacts as those for which they are looking, but Midgard is probably where they should start.  [Xela](npc-xela), the queen of the gnomes, is one of the two collectors, who specializes in magical artifacts.  The other is a collector of antiquities (magical or non-magical, so long as they are old) from Canis by the name of [Mikhael Volokhov](npc-volokhov).

Upon doing some research, Ariona discovers that the founders of Canis were 4 brothers by the name of Volokhov, one of whom is Mikhael.

Apparently, there is also a family of vampire slayers, by the name of the Von Helsings.  If anyone is going to know about weapons that could hurt vampires, it would be them.

(Nikolai also gets his items identified.  He has a lantern which has Continual Light on it, but also maybe something else, which he dubs the Prismatic Lantern; a four-inch-long scarab beetle, which he attaches to his forearm; a large, feathered thing, which is apparently the antenna of a Rust Monster; a Hat of Disguise; and of course, the pair of roller skates, which have a Displacement effect on them.)

Moss notes that he was hesitant to mention Xela, and Thorpe says he has it on good authority that the Spear is likely to be in Midgard.  Vitorrio wonders if they can just ask to borrow it, or buy it, or what?  Those who know of Xela think this is somewhat unlikely. :P

Vitorrio insists that Xela might be of assistance to them, and notes that he remembers her as a tall, stately woman with green robes and jewels, who goes by the name of [Anastassia Zelakov](/pax/npcs/xela).

Nikolai continues to play with his lantern, trying out various things on a protesting Vittorio.  He then moves on to trying out the entire rainbow gamut on an unsuspecting patch of grass, which changes . . . not at all.  Unfortunately, at the end of this, he accidentally breaks the orange lens.

At this point, Ariona remembers a few things.  The Volokhovs, though not amazingly potent on their own, are purported to use linking to protect their world.  Also, Xela is known (by a few) to have once repaired an extremely powerful amulet, probably of artifact level.

Now, Ariona goes shopping.  She gets a bag of synthetic precious gems, and some copper wire and ring molds (at Vittorio's behest).  Nikolai continues experimenting.  Essentially, everyone is occupied for the next 23.5 hours.

At the end of the time, everyone briefly feels that they are stretched over 9 light years for a moment, and then the feeling resolves.

-----

DEE arrives near to Canis, and requests that Bryce help him to hack into logs of incoming vessels to make their arrival look expected.  He does so, and the planetary officials believe that they are a survey team here on a shore leave break between sectors of space.  The group is greeted as they disembark by an android woman who seems to see nothing amiss in their arrival.

DEE immerses himself in the local Net, and Bryce and Ariona locate both the Volokhovs' residence and the capitol building, along with a detailed map of the city.  They rent a van, and head for the private residence of the colony's founders.

Bryce contacts their manor, and informs the person who picks up the contact (at 4 am), that they have some items that they believe Mikhael might be interested in.  When pressed, he admits that the items are of unknown age and value.

Stefen and Ivan Volokhov introduce themselves, and ask to see what the party has brought for them to look at.  Nikolai shows them a feather, which he claims was a Swanmee feather, and says that it helps to influence people.  He offers it in exchange for fixing the lantern.

A lot of bluffing and double-talk happens, but basically they end up deciding to return in three days to meet with the Volokhov's associate, who may be able to fix the lantern.  At that time, Nikolai may be willing to part with other objects, but would definitely give them the feather in exchange for fixing the lantern.

Back on the ship, Ariona asks more questions about how alchemy works, and whether the type of "bits" used makes a difference.  Nikolai says he thinks so, but he doesn't really exactly know how it works.  Ariona hands him some nail clippings and a bit of hair, and tells him to try doing things with those bits.

-----

Upon arriving back on Earth, DEE travels to New York and takes a berth.  On Monday, June 19th, Vittorio and Nikolai head off to the designated meeting place, trying to stay as far away from each other as they can without Vitto feeling like he's going to die.

Two individuals sit down on either side of Vittorio, and greet him.  They say he needs to go to "the place," and Vittorio is forced to admit he has an "associate."  The goons appear surprised, but take him along.  Vitto remarks that "necessity makes strange . . . cellmates".

The skinny goon asks how they can be sure that Vittorio is who he claims he is, given what happened.  After all, they watched him be buried.  The fat goon tells him that they will not take him to the Boss unless they're sure of him.  Vitto responds with great detail about the house in which he grew up, and they say, "Well, we're satisfied."

At this point, they draw their guns and attempt to shoot him.  Vitto is too fast for them, however, and they shoot into the seat behind them.  "What the fuck?!" the skinny guy cries, and Vittorio continues to intimidate the crap out of them.

Finally one of the goons says, "You can't remember everything, or you wouldn't have come back."  Vitto pretends he knows what they're talking about, and finally says that he's come back to give his father another chance.  He's seen the light of the Caretaker, he's talked to Emmanuel personally.  He surmises that his father had him killed because he wasn't following God properly, and the goons seem to react as if this is the truth.

Vittorio then orders the goons to give up their weapons.  The fat one says, "We ain't gonna shoot you," and the skinny one mutters, "Just do it!"  They do, and then continue the ride uncomfortably until their destination.

They arrive at a Chinese restaurant and proceed to a back room.  Vitto's father regains his composure before he speaks.  He appears surprised, however, and Vitto reassures him that the goons followed his orders; it just didn't work this time.  He explains a bit about what has happened to him, and moves on to informing his father that the Caretaker's will isn't being done, and that it needs to be.  Orlando remarks that he likes the new Vittorio.

Vitto also remembers more about his past, and begins to wonder if he really has the right of things after all.  He remembers some more names like Constantine and Adriana (the fat and skinny mooks), and finally Orlando tells Vitto that he will take him to the Boss.  Surprise, surprise, [Harry Bryant](npc-bryant) walks in the door.

-----

Harry suggests that Orlando leave them alone, which he does with a respectful nod to Harry.  Vittorio nods and says, "Father," and asks Orlando to give his regards to his mother.  On his way out, Orlando mutters, "I still don't know why he cares about that."

Vitto notes that he was working with Moss, and that he knows what Harry is.  They play the Question Game for a bit, and finally Harry asks after Moss.  Vitto replies, "Moss?  Oh, he's fine.  A little hungry for danishes as the moment, but fine."

Harry appears puzzled, but continues.  He doesn't think that the Spear is necessary, especially as it would require fighting Cain, which might be bad. :P  Vitto presses the issue, and Harry admits that he's not sure where the Spear is.  He agrees that Xela's probably a good bet, though.  Vitto wants Harry's assistance, however, and Harry doesn't really want to give it.

He suggests, however, that the Crown might be more useful.  It's apparently on Canis right now; it seems the Volokhovs "outbid" him on the item which he had hired someone to "acquire" for him.  Vitto notes that that is quite a coincidence, as he has an appointment on Canis the next day.

Harry ultimately returns to DEE with Nikolai and Vitto, where the entire group discuss their plans.  Ariona asks if Bryant needs the Crown for anything after dealing with Cain, and he replies that he needs it for something related to the Caretaker's project afterward, but likely for no more than one month.  She then suggests that they should offer Xela the Crown when Bryant is done with it, in exchange for the use of the Spear.

Everyone thinks this seems like a good plan, so they head off.  Ariona, Nikolai, Vitto, Thorpe, Meechum, and Bryant will be the "away-team," and Bryce and DEE will be watching through the 'jacks.

-----

Harry notes that they might want to get directly below the surface, because it usually takes a long time to get permission, people might not all be welcome, and even if they get permission it will take hours to take the elevator below the surface.

So, with several different Displacement effects, the party bamfs to Valhalla, where they are met by a bunch of dwarves with short swords.  They manage to convince the dwarves not to kill them, and beg to be taken to see Xela.  They're told that that's not how it normally works, but they finally see a Royal man who says he will tell the Queen their brief proposal.

A tall, beautiful human-seeming woman approaches them, and begins conversation.  She is intrigued by their proposal, but demands collateral.  Nikolai reluctantly hands over the lantern, but is pleased (and massively disturbed) that she notes that the lens is "easily fixed."  Xela then begins to play with the lantern, shoving a few colored lenses into it and spinning it.

This has the rather unpleasant effect of confusing many of the party, and causing them to attack nearby targets.  The dwarven guards attempt to restrain them, and chaos ensues.  Nikolai takes notes on the artifact.

[A young dwarf](npc-gerald) walks in, and demands to know what Xela wanted from him.  She explains that she wants to lend these people his sword for a bit.  At around this time, the spell wears off, and everyone straightens themselves out.

"So you called me here to take my toy?  Fine."  He jabs the gigantic crystalline sword from his back into the ground and laughs.  "Good luck; no one can wield it but me."

Several party members attempt to touch the sword, with limited success, until Nikolai walks over, draws the sword, and watches it turn from a gigantic crystalline sword into a light rapier.  Gerald appears a bit stunned, but acquiesces easily.

Thus, the agreement is as follows:  the party will "borrow" the Sword until Xela demands it back.  Furthermore, until such time as the party delivers the Crown to her, she will hang on to the lantern.  When they give her the Crown, she will return the lantern.  She will also probably fix the lantern for Nikolai, and he'll probably give her something cool in return.

"There is one more price on my assistance.  You," and she turns to Thorpe, "have meddled in my affairs for too long."  She points a finger at Thorpe, and a bolt of energy shoots from her fingertip.  Thorpe disintegrates into a pile of ash on the floor, as the party looks on in horror.

THE END
