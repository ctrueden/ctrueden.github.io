The party (specifically, [Ariona Cassyon](char-public-alex), [Nikolai](char-public-jon), [Vitorrio Garibaldi](char-public-allen), and [Meechum](char-public-joey)), still reeling from the shock of Thorpe's destruction, returns to [DEE](char-public-griffin) with the aid of [Harry Bryant](npc-bryant).  Onboard the ship, they are rejoined by [Bryce Murphy](char-public-andy) and [William Moss](npc-moss), the latter of whom is working feverishly to restore [Everlily Nyx](npc-nyx).

A discussion with Bryant prompts Moss to disappear for a few moments and return with one of the original sensors from Pax Artificium.  Bryant seems quite surprised, and is pleased with the idea of using this as a bargaining chip.

-----

DEE takes off shortly thereafter, and arrives a few moments later in Canis subspace.  Upon their arrival, a message from [Stefan Volokhov](npc-volokhov) reaches them, stating that he and Ivan will meet with them at their earliest convenience, and inquiring as to whom they should expect at said meeting.

Apparently, the answer is only Ariona and Nikolai.  They agree to start the bargaining with a much lower amount than they have available to them, perhaps half of what Bryant brought.  On the way to the meeting, however, Ariona gets an encrypted message from Bryce mentioning that the Volokhovs paid approximately 1 percent of the amount in DEE's hold to acquire the crown in the first place. Ariona passes this information on to Nikolai, and suggests that perhaps they start with that exact amount, as an intimidation tool.

When the two of them arrive, they see Stefan and Ivan Volokhov.  Along with them is an older man with greying hair and a grey goatee, wearing rumpled brown robes.

The Volokhovs are pleasant, but appear surprised when Nikolai explains that he no longer needs the lantern fixed.  They appear somewhat disbelieving of Nikolai's suggestion that they would like to attempt to negotiate for the use of the Circlet, instead, and immediately ask if Bryant has anything to do with this proposition.  They also make some scathing remarks about Bryant and his inability to secure the Crown for himself.

Nikolai names the agreed-upon amount, and at their startled reaction, mutters to Ariona, "Why did we name that price?"  Ariona replies, quietly but loud enough that they might very well be able to hear, "Because that's what they paid for it."  When the individuals back on DEE get that portion of the conversation, Bryant says to Bryce, "I'll pay ya five credits for a screen capture of that."  Bryce immediately agrees.

Rapid-fire discussion in Russian follows, with mini-Vee translating in Ariona's ear.

-----

Back on the ship, Everylily Nyx takes a shuddering breath, but appears to still be unconscious, and still made of stone.

Bryce constructs a list of approximately 3% of what's in the hold, all antiquities, and leaves for the mansion escorted by Meechum (who has grown to 7'2" tall).

In the vehicle en route, Bryce questions Meechum about what exactly is up with his multiple personalities.  Meechum tells him that there are two people, "Meechum" and "Divin"; Divin used to be able to take contol of Meechum at will, but now switches back and forth with Meechum every 5 minutes.

-----

"Oh, by the way, we were very rude.  This is our companion, Leonard."  They also offer lodgings for the evening.  They appear genuine, so Ariona agrees to stay with them for the night.

The "circlet" appears now to be a large, extremely ornate crown, one that would probably give anyone wearing it quite a neck-ache.

Meechum continues to confuse and disturb everyone.  For example, he requests that some caviar be brought to him . . . in exactly 5 minutes.

They request one additional guarantee, re Harry Bryant:  "Should this circlet ever, EVER, be brought to his personal attention, that you show him a video feed of ``this''."  They promptly drop a gigantic, beautiful crystal on the floor.  "I understand that was one of his favorites."

The transaction is completed, with the Volokhovs demanding the full amount brought (i.e., 3 percent), and Ariona and Nikolai eventually agreeing.  They box up the crown, and return to DEE.  When the crate is opened again, the "crown" appears just as it was described to both Nikolai and Ariona in the past.  Ariona suggests to Nikolai that since it appears to be willing to be used by either of them, and he's got the sword, she'll take the crown.  He agrees, and notes that he's got a hat, anyway.

-----

Moss has obviously been up all night.  Nyx appears to be partially flesh again, and partially able to speak and cry, etc., but still partially stone.  Obviously, she's quite a bit slower, too.

When she gets to that point, she immediately collapses on a heap in the floor.  "He made me bite him," she says.  "He made me drink his blood.  You should have left me as I was."  As the party contemplates this horrific development, they can all see the capillaries on her wings beginning to turn black.

Moss believes he can slow the process, but it will take everything he's got to restore her.  He and Nyx begin to research how to fix her, but they are forced to deal with the fact that this "taint" upon her is effectively like dealing with backlash, and the problems inherent therein.

-----

While DEE is calculating the trip to Earth, on Wednesday, June 21st, they receive another news broadcast, stating that the missing ship from Luna has crashed on Mars.  Now that the information is declassified, we find out that the U.N. ship ``Vesta'' had left Luna to study an anomalous astronomical phenomenon, and disappeared en route.

A few hours later, another news broadcast reaches their attention.  There is an "unofficial" 24-hour curfew imposed upon the entire colony on Mars.  Everyone there should remain inside their homes unless it is absolutely necessary to go out, and please remain calm.

Nikolai and Ariona experiment a bit with their new Artifacts.  Nikolai continues practicing in the weight room, and Ariona accidentally glues everyone's (except for Nikolai's) right hands to their heads for about an hour.

-----

DEE returns to Earth, and promptly makes his way towards Mars.  He arrives in Mars subspace around 1 am on Thursday, June 22nd.  During the calculation time, all contact was lost with the colony on Mars.  Furthermore, all civilian vessels have been warned not to travel to Mars under any circumstances, as the U.N. is investigating [potentially hazardous circumstances](npc-cain) there.

-----

DEE is also hailed from Mars immediately, with the message, "Military vessel DEE, have you come to offer assistance?  We are being overwhelmed."  DEE asks them to explain their situation, which they do.  They are being overwhelmed by undead; particularly, every time they try to offer emergency displacement sites to get off-planet, the sites are quickly overwhelmed and the mystics are killed.
"That is to be expected."
"And why should we have expected this?"
"You shouldn't have.  However, I am not surprised."

DEE informs the rest of the party of the colony's situation.  He jacks his screens into the feed from the colony, showing everyone what's been going on there.  They also observe, rather significantly, that there appear to be undead in U.N.F. uniforms directing the rest of the undead storming the city.

Nyx, who has apparently snuck back onto the bridge during the turmoil, says grimly, "He has to be stopped."  Her wings are now completely bat-like, rather than fairy-like.  Vittorio says they can't trust her near Cain, and she explains that what is happening to her right now is backlash.  He argues that they still can't take that chance; Nyx and Moss argue that they will need her.

Moss also points out that the circlet was able to affect Nyx earlier, so it would be logical to assume it could do so again.  This could be used as a last resort to protect them from her if she turns against them.

The party works out their mystic enhancements, courtesy of William Moss.  He generously offers to buff them rather significantly.  Meanwhile, DEE begins to coordinate the defenses of the colony against the hordes of undead.

-----

Just as the party finishes fixing themselves up and preparing to exit DEE, twelve zombies appear on the bridge of the ship.  This is a magical effect.  Bryce promptly disappears.  This is not a magical effect.

Ariona attempts to use the circlet to cause all of the undead on the ship to lay down and not move.  Instead of any of the predictable effects, she hears a voice in her head.  "Oh.  ``I'' see.  So ``this'' was your plan.  ``Thank'' you."  The undead appear unaffected.  Ariona then runs across the cabin.

Vittorio draws his fist-blade and stabs one of the zombies.  Moss punches one into jelly.

Meechum emanates electrical energy from his body, frying three zombies.  They quiver, but remain standing.

One zombie tries to attack Vitto, and fails as he falls right through Vitto's incorporeal form.  One shambles towards Ariona.  Three attempt to attack Meechum, but "it's like being dog-piled by three-year-olds."

DEE notices a ship passing directly through the side of the dome, without somehow breaching said dome.  DEE informs Bryce that another ship has appeared in the dome, and he is attempting to establish contact with it.

Nikolai slashes through the neck of the zombie sauntering towards Ariona, but does not quite sever the head entirely.

Two zombies go after Moss, and fail miserably, and one more heads for Ariona.

Ariona attempts to shoot the zombie that Nikolai slashed, but fails to hit anything significant.

Moss punches two more zombies in their faces, turning said faces into pulp, but the headless bodies continue to cling to him.

-----

Three of the zombies, who are standing back to back, have not yet acted.  At this moment, they begin to speak in unison.  "To the one in command of this vessel.  I am currently in possession of the antimatter core from the ``Vesta''.  You will cease this bombardment, or I will expose it."

There is a pause, in which DEE calculates whether he is likely to be caught in the blast.  The zombies continue, "We can easily continue this on the surface, and I would happily remove my minions from your ship."

DEE considers this. "Can you understand me if I communicate with you?"
"Yes, I can," the three zombies reply, still in unison."
"The destruction of the city could be an acceptable loss if it would destroy you."
"I would not make this threat if it would."

Meanwhile, the other ship requests to be in constant communication with DEE, but DEE requests first, their credentials, and second, their purpose for being on Mars.  Bryce goes on the job to find out more information as well.

DEE points out that the city is likely to fall in either case, but "I would prefer to parlay if the terms are reasonable."
"Land outside the forest and we will discuss this more personally."
"I will not land the ship; I will land a shuttlecraft with representatives."

Cain threatens that at any evidence of treachery, he will expose the antimatter core, and given that the meeting site is in the arboretum, it would get the heart-trees . . . which would send the destruction to all other colonies with heart-trees.

DEE replies, "Cease combat operations and I will do the same."

"Very well," Cain replies.  "It will be done."  The remaining (mostly intact) zombies disappear in a puff of smoke and brimstone, but the three half-destroyed zombies simply collapse.

-----

Moss growls, very forcefully, "Where's Nyx?!"

The other ship is identified as the ``Perseverance,'' and claims that they were sent by [the Order of Gaia](org-gaia) to stop Cain.  DEE agrees to open communications, and informs his inhabitants of such.  [Malcolm](char-public-ozzyie), their techie, sends a quick crew manifest to DEE.

Vittorio demands to know whether they have some zombie-fighting capabilities; they reply "uh, some, I guess."

Moss informs DEE (and through him, everyone on the ``Perseverance'') that Nyx has teleported to the arboretum as well.  He still appears quite angry.  He pops the fusion battery out of his knuckles and puts another one in.

Knowledge is traded between the ships, including that antimatter may be able to be destroyed with destruction magic.  How much destruction magic was not stated.

DEE requests more information about heart trees.  [a high female voice](char-public-danielle) replies with what she can.

The other ship requests permission to phase halfway into DEE so that they can simply step off onto DEE.  Nikolai is vastly disturbed by something NOT being where he is at this moment.

DEE communicates with Sarah, the AI on the ``Perseverance.''  DEE discusses algorithms with Sarah; he apparently might be getting an upgrade shortly.  Sarah would like to give DEE her unique technology; she asks that it be put in a secure location until DEE can fix the security hole in his LORE chip.

The high voice informs DEE at this point that she thinks that the heart tree's link could be severed from [the Caretaker](npc-caretaker) and the other heart trees, but it would be difficult and might take a significant amount of time.

-----

Six individuals appear in DEE's Cargo Bay Three, this time non-magically.  They introduce themselves as [Trenton Vernor](char-public-mark), [Laiden Rahu](char-public-jason), [Fey Arius](char-public-danielle), [Dr. Andrew Peters](char-public-paul), and [Noun and Pronoun](char-public-lucas).  With them at this time are Bryce, Nikolai, Ariona, Meechum, Vitto (appearing fully solid and "normal"), and "Crazy Pete."  The far end of the bay is occupied with DEE's shuttlecraft.

Harry Bryant at this time is elsewhere on the ship, having stated no desire to go talk to Cain.

On the other ship, [Malcolm Biggs](char-public-ozzyie), [Ridge](char-public-athena), and [Admiral Rossner](npc-rossner) remain on the bridge.  They are able to hear and be heard by the others through the link between DEE and Sarah.
