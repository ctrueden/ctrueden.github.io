The group learns that Cain has been targeting powerful mystics and converting them to undead.  The public has heard in news stories that the Mars colony is under attack from supernatural forces and that UN Forces has been deployed to handle this situation.

Ridge approaches Rossner to gain more details on Cain targeting mystics on Mars.  Rossner brushes off his mild surprise she has knowledge on this and tells her that the UNF Vesta crashed on Mars.  He doesn't care about the details, just wants to know how to kill him.  UNF armies on the ground have been combating the undead army.  No one has reported to have seen Cain.   All casters that try to scry him have unsuccessfully, causing great harm to the casters.  The Millier 1 algorithm has not generated any useful information.

Pronoun says there are other ways to divine that does not cause unconsciousness.  He's looking for someone who will be near Cain in the near future.  It is determined that perhaps Nix is the best choice?  Dr Peters wants to know how Noun can divine the future, but the answer is complex enough where Dr Peters isn't interested right now.

Fey says she might be able to locate Nix through one of her contacts, but she might not be unavailable right now.  Rossner wants to know who this contact is.  Fey says it's her teacher.

It is suggested Noun use his ability with Luna or the caretaker.  Or maybe one of the known persons sent to investigate the planet that has been turned into undead.  We settle on contacting Nix after all, and Pronoun warns that no one watch Noun doing this ritual as it can be extremely harmful (including Serra).  Laiden convinces Serra to delete the files as they go along, but thinks it's silly.

Noun contacts Nix in the near future.  A translucent pixie with vague simple features appears - spiky red hair, sword in hand, armored, etc.   Noun learns Cain must be stopped on Mars' arboretum in the great forest, is vulnerable to the Lungesh spear, and is working converting everyone to undead, starting with Mars.   The communion ends as Nix feels the "master" calling.

Noun takes a crap load of damage, in lethal damage.  Dr Peters goes to heal Noun, TKing objects to his hand, stabbing stuff into his neck, Lincoln lights on his forehead, plugs into his jack.  Then rests on him healing him for some, then connects to his mind, sensing the nightmare from the void.  Tap the keys on his forehead, Noun wakes up.

Noun is awake and wild, hand clamping his hands to his ears, waving around him.  Pronoun tries to get his attention.  Dr Peters uses a tranqualizer on him.  Pronoun is telling him there is no sound.  Noun snaps back, Pronoun climbs back up to Noun's shoulder and says, "It was a success".

Ridge questions whether this was a good idea, but Noun through Pronoun says it was fine.

Noun wants to share information, but says he'll have to protect us from what just happened to Noun.  Noun can't tell us what happened directly.  Noun indicates to Ridge that we should try to find the spear that killed Christ.

There is a discussion of whether tactical nuclear weapons, orbital lasers, and other type of weaponry can be used.

The news that Cain destroys some undead seems odd.

Pronoun tries to pick Rossner's pockets, but is caught lies to say he is looking for mints.  Researching the spear and undead stuff.  Legend of the spear, considered a holy weapon, legendary.  Trenton tells us about this legendary weapon, but has taken other forms (sword excaliber, Moljinir, etc) -- learned through books.  It was supposedly a bladed weapon that severed Cain's hand long ago.

Undead, typical tactics against undead (low level stuff).

We get to Earth (Moscow).  Laiden threads us together, Trenton ports us there.  In the grove..  Three Halflings nearby, two run off, Liza comes offer,   Oh you're the ones that planting.  She seems friendly, middle aged, not old, not young (Halfling).

We want to talk to the caretaker, and everyone else has been talking with him.  We say we have spoken with it before, and that Sledge let us.

We all touch the tree.  The weapon has left the hands of king of the people's of the deep (earth).  Knowledge surrounding the lord of the undead is shrouded.  The propheciy may not be enlightening... &quot;The land of blood and tears cries out as the spear of the damned pierces its newly awakened flesh.&quot;

The weapon is on its way to battle the evil one.  There are always other opportunities.

Sun souls were a boon in the continual struggle against the void.

The dragon world sharing goes.

Noun wants to know why the Dragons are so dumb.  The keeper of the world of dragons has chosen its own path.  Caretaker is non-judgemental with no opinion.  Gaia's memories fade, so if there was a time that they were more closely related that it was so long ago only a shadow of memory remains.

Argument that the void is following the dragon world more quickly, but caretaker thinks that is insufficient data.  Even so it is possible we might want to reason with the being.  Caretaker believes noun doing the talking is our best chance.  Noun wants to know how he can do this?  Last time it didn't help.  Wonders whether Noun can help out with this, (the time will come, but not yet) the caretaker says it not time yet -- riddled with depth that Noun appreciates.  Noun senses that the caretaker has not embraced all of what Noun understands.

If you wish to stop Cain, proceed to Mars.  If not your fate is in your own hands.  The caretaker says Cain must be stopped by someone.  The folks with the spear left 20-June-2299 (the spear awakened 4 days ago).  You will find those when you find Cain.

No historically other weapons known to help out.

The caretaker doesn't know the exact details of how the William Moss device works.  Reaching the nexus point of fate which converges on Mars.  The caretaker trusts in destiny.  It doesn't actually know what's going to happen, where exactly where the weapon went. Etc..  (this is all indirect).

Laiden wants to know more exactly what happened to the sun souls.  They were a timely boon to the building of the machine.  They can not be reused because they have been fused into a single being, which can not be reused.  They function as a perfect center piece to the machine.  Gaian half of the caretaker has some sadness/ashamed of how this was used, but there is a sense this was more important to allow the Earth to survive, and that eventually the balance must be restored.

The souls will be forever fused with Cain.  The tree on the sun survives, but it is not being used right now.  It will last several more weeks, but has no specific plans to do anything with it.  It has explored the tree and sent sunlight out.

Fey thinks that some reasoning were things that were needed.  Prophecy does not lie, that's all he can offer.

Malcolm learns the following about attacking Cain from God, "The salvation of the cosmos rests in the lessons of history, but tragedy awaits either great or small" -- get the feeling that no matter what you do something bad will happen but it could be less bad if we do something?? Like what sort of clue is there???

Ridge builds four flash grenades that also work against undead (4d6 against light sensitive)

The ship is now transporting to Mars, and Rossner insists to go along.  We transport to Mars, Noun feels something snap (about reality and time) based on his recent activities.  We feel like a large gong went off in our minds.  When things clear...

Laiden, Serra says to Laiden.  We're in the atmosphere and we're falling.  We pilot out of it, we're not in a domed section of Mars.  We see a crater ahead, there is a ship there, that Pronoun says it crashed five days ago. UNF Vesta

Investigating the site, there is something unusual about it, doesn't make sense it would be unsalvaged after 3 days.

Has anyone been disbatched to salvage that?  Several disbatched, all eliminated (slain or converted).  Any significants of this crash site with right now.   The ship sensors find no movement, life signs, or unlife near the ship (can't be 100% on that).   It is a military ship (small warship type thing).

Pronoun coughs politely, sometimes when you teleport you get lost and don't end up where you want to be.  Noun is bluffing, he really has an idea what happened.  The universe hates us in general (our team).  When you teleport you skirt around the void, but it might notice and sort of swat at you.

Wondering whether we can sense unlife and by that find Cain (highest unlife signal).  Serra has done something which might detect them, but is unsure.

In a smaller crater, there is a data crystal in its own crater.  A droid is sent to get it.  Ridge ties herself to the droid's sensors.  The data crystal looks scratched up (there is streaks of blood off of the ship).

Droid sent to look at the ship, Ridge repairs the data crystal and reads the log from the UNF Vesta.  The droids feeds back wreckage, one body is there (on the bridge), he seems dead from a blow to the head, but around his neck is a rosary.  The log says, "Captain's own reporting, whatever it was we tracked from Luna has taken over the ship.  It has no mercy no sympathy.  It has taken all the folks, I have taken over this ship and set it crash on Mars.

Ship is wrecked, may take days to restore the ship.  The anti-matter core is missing.  Is believe is needed?  Yes.  Extract the body from the ship.  She grabs a couple parts.  Maybe Cain ported the anti-matter core away.

There are obvious tracks leading to the dome.  Large quantities of undead heading that way.  Can the core be detected, yes if we get close enough.  Examine the captian, no assault, blow to the head.  Take the rosary, and the body remains dead for now.

We are flying to the dome.  Body held in gravitic drive.   Laiden creates a portkey on a towel.

Go through an air lock, Serra says take a look at this.  Zooms in on a sigil on a ship (my successor).  Cloak and move.  Laiden is carrying a large duffle bag.

Serra's detecting undead seems to be working, but can sense the difference in strength.

Three zombies on DEE stand back to back, telling them to stop or they will use the anti-matter core (exposing it).

Rossner attempts to sense the anti-matter.

Laiden sends some hacker on Dee that we're sent on a mission from Gaia to destroy Cain.  Ridge sends Dee the "fatal" flaw of himself in a prepared form letter.

Ridge: Pilot
Noun: Artist
Fey: Gentic engineer
Laiden: Captian
Trenten: Historian
Malcolm: Preacher
Dr Peters: Doctor

Vito ghost, Arizona small, Nix stone, pete crazy, dee the ship, meechum split personanilties, brice sickly, nicoli weird

Dee is communicating with Serra letting him know that its shielding protecting them from the goo.  Serra tells her limitations to protect herself.  It was indicated that she doesn't have access to certain things.

Dee wants to talk with Laiden.  Bryce wishes to pass some new security ideas with DEE.

DEE will send something to compare to see if the algorithms are similar.

Rossner, Ridge, and Malcolm stay on the ship.

Fey thinks the connection between Mars and the Caretaker could be done.  Cutting down the tree would not kill Earth (really difficult to cut it down)- DEEs weapons would take several minutes to cut.

Party introduction are done by Curtis
