Serra reviewing the computer logs finds that an encrypted transmission was sent from Perseverance to a convenience store during the search for the antimatter core.  Scanning the convenience store shows it currently has no back up fusion power and no signs of life.  Serra tells Laiden it will take a while to decrypt.

Moss and Nix are unconsciously resting on the ship separately under video surveillance, with a droid as a sentry at each door, and Trenton walking the hall between them.  Dr Andrews occasionally goes in the rooms to medical monitor them.

Andrew points out Moss took all of Cain's evilness.  He wishes everyone to consider finishing him.  The group wants to consult with the Caretaker first.

Admiral Rosner, Laiden, Nix and Malcolm leave the ship to talk with the caretaker.

Learned from the Caretaker:
The Caretaker assures everyone that what was done was a necessary step in saving the universe.  He expresses sorrow for what happened to William Moss.  His future is cloudy and could pose difficulties, but he can be saved depending on this group's and others' actions.

Moss now has the Cain's undead aspects; his soul can withstand the taint for at least months if not years, but will eventually submit to it if not cleansed.  Nix's undead taint is more typical of undead, where as Moss is now the source of undead.  Curing Nix will be just as difficult as during Moss.

Caretaker doesn't offer any insight to helping Moss.  Caretaker doesn't wish to interfere with terrians more, so he is only guiding as required towards certain critical goals.  Remaining with non-interference.  Walking through them through their trails would defeat the purpose of protecting them.

Growing urgency and a slight distraction and that he is extremely busy.  Feel that he is going to become busier and busier until this is solved.

Confirmation that the heart tree is fine.  All of them, the threats to the trees is over.

Are we strong enough, we are as strong as you chose to be.  Many of the questions is of the "I can't help you" nature.

The sun souls
All souls are being part of the structure to be imbued with the machine to be part of the machine.  These souls are fused into the "oversoul".  The over disposition is negative then positive as part of being the structure (irrelevant, because it will be needed).

Normal circumstances it would have explored the new forms and see what it wanted to do.  The entire thing could have been reincarnated.  It is a metaphysical essence of some sort, and there are situations where memories from the hosts life is partially retained in an afterimage effect.  From a gaian perspective it caries on its past lives.

Subjegated souls are considered alive?  Are they just parroting life or is it sentient?  Theory is that all truly sentient beings have a soul.

Speak with these souls again?  It is reluctant, to let us.  If you speak to me again in two days time, currently they are being processed in a manner that they can't talk.  This processing will not change them, merely extracting a something from them (its like a foreign body- it won't really notice the difference, better or worse).

The tree on the sun still thriving yes?  Limited time to examine it.

There is a structure of souls will be infused into Cain (that will happen as a mystic rite).  Crown of Nebacanezer is a major item that is needed to make this happen.  The crown's status is in flux, but all predictions that it will be in place as needed.

The crown the other group had is a false crown.  The true crown has other allies going after it.

The machine is a device that the caretaker and allies are constructing that requires an immense amount of power.  The two together could power the new machine that projects the appearance of a strong psionic signature into space.

The void pursues either mystic energies, psionic signatures, or both.  This machine will produce a massive signature that the void can follow. For a long time.

Right now the miller algorithm is rife with prophecies of doom and destruction of Earth.  Possibly varies things to try stopping it leads to destruction except this route.  Details of these computations are so complex that terrians can't comprehend it.

Self fulfilling prophecies like WW3 is possible.  Is it possible?  Must either chose to believe it or take it as warnings.  Is it better to just ignore it?  Doesn't believe void is sentient, just instinctual.  It has miller 2 and its help has been phemoninal.  It conveys regret that it was necessary.

The flaw in the Lore chip was implemented by their designer -- one my children -- Royals.  The caretaker takes advantage of a flaw in the chip that is know to very few and does not expect that flaw to be abused in the future.

Admiral Rossner talking to caretaker, each has their own individual reasons.

Relationship between the Earth and the Dragons?  Gaia is more connected to the dragons.  There is frustration that Gaia doesn't remember, long ago something happened and she was lucky to survive (65 millions of years ago or something).

Three hundred years ago a dragon appeared.

Gaia came first or the energy came first?  The energy was probably there first.

Your involvement will continue to be at a high level of importance.  Take care as their many that who would oppose you.

Malcolm, Fey, and Laiden return back to the ship.

Laiden accessing a map the location was a convenience store (stand alone) -- three level tiers with flying cars -- big PDQ.  Scanning for power sources and life signatures.  Colonies are generally powered by antimatter, but with it gone works on fusion/backup.  There is no such signature .  No life forms .

There are still thousands of undead on the ground.  What does the military plan to do?  They are not sure.  All those observed inactive were zombies.  The more powerful types are around.  Rosner wonders if it makes more sense to wait until he awakens or be far away.

Some traveled to Mars to be closer to Cain.

The message was decrypted.  Laiden gets it -- you'll have to ask the DM or Jason for details.

Lessons of Percepi?  What can the terrans learn?  Need to know more about the void.  Malcolm wants to know the true nature of the void, it is everything that could have happened, but didn't and also what did.  It is everything but now.  It suffuses the universe.  Now is like the oil on the universe.

Noun says if we control time by our thoughts?  It is theorized that the dragon planet is changing time.

Does the caretaker know this theory?

The dragon is receptive to talking with us?  To help us tell us what's going on?  Perhaps mystic energy does is realign possibilities, thus messing with the void.

What happened at Percepi?  Unknown.  Infused 29 years ago?    His arch was completed?  Lots of traffic through the tree.

The structure's status is unchanged.  Scanning surface shows no undead.

Evil yes, souls yes.  Checking the zombies.

Recall that when undead is destroyed, its soul is cast into the sun.

Rosner frees Ridge to vacation and he leaves to redevous with troops on the ground.  Wonders whether the caretaker can be trusted?  What's the point, we're screwed...

Fey goes to Earth to get some things answered.  At Halfling village, they are going about their daily type things that they are doing.  Sledge is there, greets her.  Fey looks to speak with a knowledgeable ones on the undead.  Sledge scratches his head, you could ask some of the really smart people.  Serra Morningcrow (the founder of the Mars colony and a werewolf).

Selena Sharptooth, angry werewolf.

Sandy haired Halfling says to try talking to the pixie (doesn't know much about him except he could drink Rufus under the table) that came back from Mars.  Rufus introduces himself.

Rufus introduced her to Nash Mistletoe.  Fey and Nash have a rash, somewhat combative talks.  Undead on Earth have been quiet (mostly lurking).  They typically lurk, become a pain in the ass, and then lurk again.  Varies undead live in different places depending on their needs.  Give him the low down.

Probably not good for them to be near the undead.  Actually he really doesn't know.  Essentially undead exist because of Cain.  Implied the undead can go through heart tree, but unclear whether that many would harm it.

Nash believes that being near the undead might be worse.  Just a theory though.

Fey talks with the caretaker.  Undead souls destroyed on Mars have gone back to the sun?  It takes a long time (years to decades to longer to purify).  No souls have gone through the trees.  Normally there is a consciousness to pull them in.  Uncertain whether Mars has awaken -- that is required to get them there.

Fey tells us that we should get away from Mars to help Moss (they influence him badly).  Suggests we get the weapon and remove Moss' hand, heal him and them reattach it.

Moss awakes and wants to know more.  Does he have a pull towards the undead?  He feels them and does not want to reach out and take them.  He says there is no pain.  Andrew Peters wonders what can do to help purify him?

Moss will try what he can.  He's been studying the phenomena at great length.  He thinks it is still possible to do a real purification.  His sanctum is destroyed, but think he'll head back to Earth do his research there.

He would like to try to awaken Lily.  Any oversight of himself?  Maybe an android or two?  Pronoun is interested in helping.  Laiden wonders whether he would want to work on the ship?  He is interested, but there is no mystic energy on the ship and feels that it is dangerous to be there.

Noun does a knowledge continuum on Moss.  Noun senses he is connected to many mathematically significantly events in the past and future.  The structures he has is very dynamic.  He can be a force of great good or bad.  Moss is not curving or drawing the void.

There was a man (named Z) who was connected to the Sun.  He helped Moss realize a few things that allowed him to shunt the taint out of himself.  We wonder whether he can stand the light of the sun.  He still wants to go to Earth, that seems like the best plan.

We want more details, but doesn't really explain much.  Moss has no other crucial tasks he needs to perform.  If he is destroyed or succumbs to the taint, the universe goes on.

Moss is unlike dopplegangers, his powers are greater.  His first memories are from a laboratory and Sid helped him.  Sid could not leave the city because he put himself into a computer.  Ridge was friends with Sid's mom.

Everyone gets a message.  Serra sees this message is from a forged signal source (fake address).  Serra scans it -- obviously from enemies.  Laiden reads it first.  Laiden shares the message with Ridge.  This is all shared with the rest.  There is a list of people who all have the same last name (Kilgerrin).  There is video feed that says we have taken custody of these individuals (false source).  Each of these individuals are injected with nanites that will terminate them unless clear codes are sent (Ridges family).

You and your crew will proceed to the following coordinates.  You have 5 days to reach the destinations, for each hour that you are late, one person will be terminated.  The coordinates are on the opposite side of the sun in an asteroid belt.   At maximum speed it will take 4.5 days to reach that location.

No signature on the message.  We you reach the location you will receive further instructions.  If you follow these instructions, no one will harmed.

Laiden says the asteroid belt is bad (place for unpleasant people).

Moss says, "Have you decided what you are going to do?".  Moss says there is no evidence in the transmission that they are telling the truth.  Pointed out that they could have just been recorded.

Laiden investigates this as electronic crime is his specialty.

Noun creates Fey a flower that has a chair in it for when she is small.  Fey is in a weird happy zen state.  Andrew Peters tries to diagnose what's going on.

Laiden and Ridge have figured out some technology to send a small object far way (dimension door type ability).  Transporter.

We cut our travel time from 4.5 days to 3.9 days.

Ridge puts together a electrical interference for mechanical eavedropping.  Dr Peters puts up a telepathic net for all of us.  Pronoun links directly up to Ridge.

Day 2 -- 29-June-2299
Based on datetimestamp we lost 12 hours.

Greater Scrying is noticeable, slightly.   Requiring a hard check.

Noun connects to these guys out of the future and talks with them.  Find out they were kidnapped, on a ship and injected with a hypo-spray.  And he thought he heard a dwarf's voice.

Moss activates Nix.

Avorals find a business card, Serra senses this is where it came from.   Laiden examines the card and it says Dr Andrew Peters, superior homo sapiens.

Malcolm scryies Dr Peters.  Noun punches Dr Peters, don't break my stuff.

The card has some odd shielding so it doesn't seem alive.  Possessed some strange organ and sent a transmission.

Moss knocks on the door, Peters is told a new threat and that it is being examined.  Peters and Moss head towards the lab.  Laiden tries detect thoughts, but it fails on Dr Peters.

Ridge does research on the card's technology.  The technology is pretty advanced??  From the brotherhood they can be involved, or it could have been StratCo???  Laiden asks if he is a doctor and what sort of doctor he is.  Peters is suspicious and wants to know what's going on.

Laiden wants to know how much he knows about genetics.  Dr Peters is evasive about the subject.  Sighing, he states he has at least competent of lower things.  He says that his limitations makes it so he can't do crafting.  Something isn't quite true...

He claims his blindness causes the issue.

Trenton spills the issue that we found a walking card.  Laiden taks the cover off the box and a card is walking around in the jar.

Dr Peters claims he never has seen the card do this before and is befuddled.  Laiden says that it was responsible for lending aid to the undead forces.

Dr Peters essentially says he isn't responsible and seems lightly upset that folks suspect him.  Wonders whether the society slipped this card???

Sent large amount of tactical information about the location of our ship, etc..

Dr Peters says the brotherhood says that he had genetic modifications, to manufacture a soldier.  One unexpected effect was the blindness.  Dr Peters shows that he takes very little damage.  Suppose to be strong, fast and easily controlled.

He has been engineered his abilities and works with other engineered folks and they are no less human.

Dr Peters remembers talking to a couple members a couple years ago.  We're not putting you on trial for your beliefs, just you brought a bug on board that did ..., and that does present some problem.

Laiden threatens that actions have to be taken if he did betray us.

Concern that it causes problems.  We want to put it in a cage.

Ridge finishes her EMP thing.

We cruise in normally and we're at the coordinates.

After a moment another ship moves out from a nearby asteroid.

Ship is painted deep navy blue with black trim and with angry sharp point tenacious devil.  Lightly bigger than our ship.

It hails us.  A woman appears, she is very fined bone, pale grey skin, slightly pointed ears (not elf), has brown hair.  She looks at all of us,

Welcome to the boneyard.  Her eyes are just like Trentons.
