SUMMARY
Laiden, Ridge, Noun, Andrew, and Fey subdue Ridge's relatives who do a fair amount of damage to the computer systems.

The Obsidian Teknokon, a strike cruiser, docks and raids our ship, Malcolm and Trenton kill its captain, Blacksoul, and the crew surrenders.

Strife, the woman from the Tenacious Devil (first woman we saw who welcomed us to the boneyard) nearly kills Noun and Laiden.  The bag holding Pronoun is destroyed, although Noun believes he can get Pronoun back.  Andrew and Trenton damage her enough to were she runs away, but not before revealing she has some vendetta against Trenton's parents.

Andrew and Malcolm heal those who are injured.  Ridge takes control of the Obsidian Teknokon (OT) which has no LORE chip, gaining four more droids.  We take OT's crew and Dorian as prisoners.  We fix Perseverance's computer systems and the hull breach.  We learn that the pirate base is half a days travel, but not exactly where, the computer systems are well wiped, and the prisoners aren't telling us.  The leader of the pirate base is Scorpio who can bend people to his will.

Funeral pyre for the dead (except for Brains and Blacksoul).  Andrew looking under Blacksoul's eye patch takes on horrible soul draining damage (two negative levels).

We find cargo marked with the symbol of Arcadia on OT that is body parts from various Gaian creatures.

This session took 32 hours game time, it is Wednesday July 3rd.

----------------
Laiden sends streaming video to the rest of the crew of Ridge's relatives tearing wires out and smashing consoles in the computer control room.  Malcolm remains behind to watch Dorian, while the rest rush to join Laiden in stopping the destruction.

Laiden begins the smack down, punching them.  He returns ship function controls to Serra so she can patch the computers to speed up the calculations for phasing.  The ship rumbles as it shakes a little.  Serra informs everyone that a ship has docked with ours and Strife's ship is near by.  Malcolm learns from Dorian the ship docked is called the Obsidian Teknokon under the direction of Captain Blacksoul.  Trenton turns around to return to the air dock.

The kids contact Ridge, wanting to what's going on.  Ridge tells the kids to stay where they are, the ship is under attack, and their parents have gone wacko.  Kids don't believe her, so she says the same message in exactly the same way again.  Ridge tries to close and lock the doors to the kid's room, but that fails.

Fey strikes Ridge's family with arrows.  Andrew successfully commands four of the five to fall asleep.  Noun shoots the remaining one, Ariel, through her head as she falls to the ground dieing.

Laiden helps Serra patch the computers.  Andrew stabilizes Ariel's wounds.  From behind, Ridge has a series of key wires slashed and falls to the ground.  Noun sensing some invisible presence fires his pistol behind Ridge, but it doesn't appear to hit anything.  Ridge summons the droids come repair her as she successfully fakes falling unconscious.

Strife appears behind Ridge's slumping body and seems surprised and runs down the hall.  Although Andrew doesn't think she was really surprised, but pretending to be surprised.  Andrew announces it's a trap.  Noun chases after her, but is aggregiously stabbed from behind.  Noun stops to tend to his wounds as Strife conintues running dow the hall past the droids on their way to Ridge.  Noun is nearly killed as he is knifed in the back again.




Trenton, Dorian, and Malcolm wait in the air dock invisibly as the door comes flying ink.  Captain Blacksoul, a compact muscular man, with an eye patch, shoulder length hair, and three day beard growth saunters in with a number of pirates. He tells them to get in and kill everyone.  Trenton fires his rail gun nearly killing Blacksoul with that single shot.  Malcolm telepathically sends a message to Blacksoul to surrender as forces are closing in around him.  He drops his sword, back off, and jumps back to his ship.  Pirates rush in fail miserably at attacking Trenton only managing to accidentally kill one of their own.  Trenton returns fire killing two more.

Malcolm flies to the other air lock blows Blacksoul away.  Then calmly suggests the rest of Pirates to surrender.  The pirates give up.  Malcolm tells the pirates on his side to listen to Trenton, turns invisible begins examining the Obsidian Teknokon.

One of the pirates says to Trenton, &quot;You're so much cooler than Blacksoul, can we join your crew Captain.?&quot;  Trenton tells them to go to the brig and has Serra bring up guiding lights.

Fey invisibly follows Strife around a corner, who then stops and is just looking around.  Fey can't sense any thoughts from her.  Trenton over wireless shares he thinks it is an illusion.  Fey fires an arrow which goes through Strife with no reaction, flies back to the help out Noun.



Droid fix Ridge a little and she is okay.

Fey not sure what's going on, but believes Trenton and is going back.

Laiden working with data sees that near by there is some hull weirdness maybe a hole or foreign substance.  Nanites might be working on it already?



Andrew tries to stabilize and succeeds.

Laiden gets stabbed for minimal damage.  Pronoun hides back in the bag.

Andrew senses the invisible person and tries to do a touch attack, but misses.

Trenton tells the other crew to stay or he'll kill them.  Going around he sees she is there shady, so he sends data describing in real time where she is at.

Laiden tries to swipe her, but she steps aside.

Ridge gets up, and shoots a laser pistol at the woman and misses.

Serra continues to fix the computers.

Malcolm is told the mooks are loose so he gets back as soon as possible.

Fey flies over and misses with pistol.

Andrew strikes precisely causing her to become stupid, unaware, and less charismatic (-6 to each).

Trenton sees that she reels and moves back away and throws something towards the group.  Grenades goes off putting people into serious damage.  Trenton shoots, and strikes for her for a little.  Trenton yells out who is she, since she can use the same abilities.

Ridge stabalizes Laiden.

Serra continues to heal the ship.

Laiden's hair color goes from black to blonde, gold metal eyes.

Malcolm flies over the crowd yells at them to stay.

Peters stabilizes Noun.

You'll pay for what you parents did and with a flick of a cloak she disappears.

Ridge hacks in to the computer system, but it doesn't think it was hacked.  The tenatious devil is there, but then just gone.

All three bodies (Ariel, Laiden, Noun), Andrew threatens if Ariel dies he dies.

Fey ties up the other family members and put them in a locked room not the computer the room.

Malcolm also find something  strange in the Obsidian Teknokon (a bunch of crates). With symbols on them -- no one knows anything about the symbols.

Ridge gains four droids from the Teknokon.

Hull damage done and sealed of with bulk heads.   Malcolm finishes it off with the wall of iron.

Dr Peters heals the ship.

Noun work with Ridge's bag to replicate his stuff (hoping to get Pronoun back).

Dorian doesn't like the other pirates.  We all arrive and meet the pirates, and they don't seem to really like him, and before they probably thought he was a tool.

Trenton asks questions to the rest.  Wanted to know what's going on.  They wanted the technology a little, but also a vendetta against Trenton and Ridge.  Apparently we're all worth a not of money.

Blacksoul has worked with Strife before.  Up to now everything was good, can't believe that bitch left us.  Trenton says he'll see what he can do.  Trenton suggest that more information can upgrade their situation.

They all say Dorian wasn't backstabbed, but he can't be killed.

Blacksoul used his eye powers to heal them.

Ridge finds that the Obsidian Teknokon has no LORE chip.  The symbol is a space symbol for Arcadia.    Some references to Boneyard 37, no location data.  All sort of conspicuous stuff (logs erased).

The first mate offers the information if we don't do anything drastic.  Trenton promises to protect him.  First mate sort of knows where the ship is.  The can guide us there, but Scorpio is there and so he suggests we stay away.

Noun goes to the other ship and Ridge guides him to tools he can use.

Dr Peters looks at Blacksoul's eye and incurs 2 negative levels.

Ridge says not to open the crates, but Noun does anyway.  Bio-hazard containment.  It is bunch of body parts -- rare organs from various creatures.  Umber hulks and various other things.

It is the 3rd of whatever month...
