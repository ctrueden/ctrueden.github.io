Trenton sees that the various Gaian body parts are very well preserved in jars and containers.  Andrew Peters hearing about these body parts begins moving quickly to Trenton and Noun as he is concerned that the opening the crates has exposed them to a biohazard.

Andrew tells Noun and Trenton to move to the airlock for quarantine.  Noun ignores Dr Peters and continues his search for tools to rebuild his bag and save Pronoun.  Trenton goes to the airlock where Andrew scans Trenton, but finds no evidence of contamination.

Malcolm attempts to work his powers, but the abilities are inconsistent and emotionally taxing.

Ridge asks Noun what he is looking for, but Noun can't communicate his thoughts well -- he doesn't know exactly what he is looking for, but will know it when he sees it.  Ridge monitors his activities to make sure he doesn't take anything critical to the ship.  Noun feels a little light headed when his skin starts erupting in blotches.  At the same time Dr Peters gets a warning from the medical bay that Ariel's life signs are critical.

Dr Peters, Ridge, Trenton, and Malcolm move to the sick bay.  Ariel's heart has stopped and her body is covered with blotches.  Andrew psionically makes Ariel better and revives her.  She is still ill and steadily getting worse.  Malcolm tries to heal her, but instead nearly her entire body erupts in blotches and is clinically dead again.

Dr Peters shoves Malcolm aside scolding him, and heals her as well as he can, but can not revive her.  He has Laiden teleport Ariel to a stasis chamber on the Teknokon Obsidian.  Trenton can see the disease that Ariel has, but does not believe he can assist.  Ariel in stasis doesn't seem to be getting any worse, but it is difficult to ascertain while in stasis.

Trenton checks on Noun, who is covered with purple blotches.  Dr Peters can not fully heal Noun, so it is decided to place him in stasis.  Just as Noun is about to get into the stasis chamber, he falls to the ground convulsing.  Dr Peters injects him with an emergency muscle relaxant and places him in stasis.

Malcolm has the droids in the sick bay run tests on him, who happily reports Malcolm is the healthiest person it's ever examined.  Malcolm contacts Laiden explaining his condition and asks him to see if he his magic is working.  Laiden reports that it is and then comes to check Malcolm, but can't detect anything; although the usual happy feeling around Malcolm isn't there.

Perseverance and the Teknokon begin their three day journey to Earth.

Trenton examines Blacksoul's aura seeing a faint lingering evil and strong waves of evil and negative energy from behind the eye patch.  Ridge checks the Teknokon's databases for information on Blacksoul's eye, but she finds nothing.

Dr Peters feels a lot better (after saving from the negative levels).  Dr Peters overpowers his abilities to heal and bring Ariel back to near full health.  Ariel says she feels like she just ate a bucket of nails.  Andrew tells her she needs to rest.

Ridge is upset that Dr Peters didn't consult either the husband or Ridge.  Trenton backhandedly says she was already dead.

Noun is treated, and time has passed almost instantly.  Blotches fade away and time has passed (27 hours).  Noun doesn't feel tired.  Dr Peters tells him to rest, but Noun moves on to find tools.  He's still missing one key item.

Laiden repairs damage done to his personal gear by some gravitic grenade.  He repairs his gear.

Malcolm meditates and can only see sister Assisi's back and feels.  Blacksoul is there pointing at Malcolm accusingly.   Malcolm feel guilty as sister Assisi scolds, "though shall not kill".

Dr Peters scans behind Blacksoul's patch finds his eye is deteriorating as well.

Dorian shares that his skin was completely replaced by the skin of a rare breed of forest troll.  His understanding is that Blacksoul's eye came from some giant-sized baby.  Fey knows these transplants are near impossible to do and has never seen this sort of success.   There is only one guy in Arcadia who does these procedures.  

As long as Dorian can remember, Strife has always had her silvery eyes.  Trenton mentions something about Pandora's children and that he knows of someone on Mars who is giving orders for that organization.  Dorian chimes in that Strife and Blacksoul are both members of Pandora's children. 

Dorian had this skin grafted three weeks ago as advance payment for killing us, and reaping our body parts for future procedures.  He claims that he isn't totally dishonorable, so he gave killing us a try.  Dorian wants something for his information on how Arcadia gets these magical creatures.  Trenton responds, "You're just kind of a jerk, and not as dangerous as the others.  One of our crew members is a Gaian and I can't guarantee she would be agreeable to any deal."

Trenton talks with Laiden to try to work out some deal so he can get the information.  Trenton says they could just space him, as he seems confident he can survive anything.  Laiden is doing the calculations to put Dorian out in space.  Laiden suggests that his reward depends on the quality of his information.  Ponce says, "The group their part of is anti soul mech and are doing something against them.  Strife has some personal vendetta against you.  Some mars contact told us and we sprung into action.  Blacksoul has some communication with the leader of ??  The Gaians were lured into space and then were attacked.  A pirate strike team are employed on Earth to help this happen.  Blacksoul uses his eye on some of them and then we just reap their parts.  He claims he wasn't part of it, but then admits he was part of it a couple times.  Their just going to keep doing it, it is quite profitable.

Personal vendetta, kill ridge, pixie parts (dust, wings, turn invisible), angel wings, and rest needed to be secured (Laiden and Peters).  They weren't too specific about how I should secure your group so I was just going to kill you.

Contact in Arcadia is Butler (name) or what they called him.

Dorian hopes he can get his ship back, but is told an undead lord has it.

Noun is making some structures and uses the bag.  

Noun is fixing his bag and building some structure.

Trenton brings the first mate to Dr Peters.  At what point did you think that the Gaian organs would make us predisposed to you.  What about the Pandora's children?  They are great, and that the higher ups were employing alternative means to destroy us.  He senses that Trenton doesn't like them and says he doesn't serve Pandora's children any more and is bending anyway that may save his ass.  The rest of the crew feels the same way.  Blah blah blah

Andrew has only the first mate look at a screen, so he'll see an image of blacksoul's eye.  Stating at it, he doesn't feel anything except intense loyalty to the captain.  The eye is horrifying, monstrous.  Peters will work to take the eye out of blacksoul's head.

Freddy, says he's the best bola thrower ever,

Dr Peters has the eye in stasis in a case where he can show it.  Fey notices that Dr Peters is carrying some familiar evil around, but not sure what it is.

Fey confronts Dr Peters, because she sense something evil.  Why are you carrying evil in your bag?  Dr Peters pulls out a case.  Fey says to keep that as far away from her as possible and that if he continues to carry this around with him, she will destroy it.

Laiden turns himself back to himself.

Dr Peters wants to determine what sort of compulsion it was, but is new to this he's not sure what's going on.  They are normal, but a little unusually subdued.  Something about their psyche is wrong (sullen and deep).  Studying more carefully, it will take lots of time to heal them over two to three weeks.  It was an extremely subtle over time.

Laiden will maintain threads on Perseverance uses various feats and abilities.

Trenton sends out a broadcast.  This group has ties to this.  His ancient family believed that magic should be sealed.  They created technicians to succeed in this goal and they are the last of this cause.  Trenton is not sure this is his path anymore.  He believes these folks are related to him.  These people are important to him and he feels personally responsible for stopping these.  Trenton was part of this experimentation, and is been geneticly modified.  He has special powers through his optical modifications that provides him with special perceptions and powers.  The group Pandora's box are the children and are related.  His parents are rather secluded in Idaho.  He doesn't want to share their locations.  

Trenton wants to contact his parents and get answers to determine what is happening.  Trenton explains what's going on being careful to not drive Fey crazy.  These guys are destroying sentient lives and it is terrible.

Dr Peters bag and all the stuff inside it explodes in flames.  He knows it was Fey.  He tries to take control of Fey, but fails in a number of ways.  Fey has run away, and Andrew can't find her.  Andrew fixes all his stuff (eye is gone).  Andrew will be able to recover DNA.

We enter earth's atmosphere.  Ridge arranges port entry and quarantine because of the magical disease.  It is an unknown problem, so we are to proceed to an orbital space station instead of landing on Earth.  Quarantine procedures begin.

Malcolm learns of the eye that Andrew has.  Dr Peters says he wants it for studying, and Malcolm understands.

Fey wants her order to decide on how to use the parts.  She wishes to get to the caretaker when she can.  Fey contacts the appropriate folks in Gaian's Order (appropriate leaders) via email.  Grave matter that she needs to talk to the council about, and if they could come closer to meet it would be great.  Caretaker needs to be informed.

Laiden believes that the UN, Gaians Order, and others believe this is all wrong and we will likely be a part of this attack to stop these things.

Trenton leaves a message to his parents spelling out what's going on and that he expects answers.

Fey tells Ridge that the full conversation between Ponce and Trenton be turned over to the UN.  And a request to be able to question him further and that he is charged to the full extent of the law.  For security purposes Laiden will request that his ship not be boarded.

We turn over everyone except for Ponce as we request that we be able to keep him for questioning -- the terms are accepted, but we are asked to clear any unusual actions.

Laiden and Ridge work to replace his normal image with his "fake" image.

Dock with station, go through quarantined.  And we are then in debriefing meeting, lengthy process (the whole day).  UN are glad Ridge is back.  He were a little concerned about her loyalty as on the nets the soul mechs on Mars went bad, and that she is the ring leader.  Supposedly soul mechs joined the undead; Ridge quickly disappears and it was recorded that classified information was send to the ground (tactical data).  The business card is turned over, Dr Peters is questioned.  Ridge's name is cleared. 

Response for Fey: If this is a matter that can not wait we can arrange a meeting immediately.  

We are free to leave on 6-July, except Dr Peters who has been requested to stay for some additional questions, and will be grilled deeper about things that happened.  Using of human test subject, Dr Peters says he needed to do this to secure the safety of the crew.  It was radiating some sort of energy, and wanted to remove it.  Dr Peters motives are questioned.  He questioned the stasis device on a ship that he has not examined before.

After a while, the UN releases him, although they questions his motives some, but nothing bad happened.

Trenton invites anyone who wants to can visit his parents.

UN agrees to repair Perseverance.

Dr Peters turns over healing of Ridge's family to the UN, knowing that they can't help them and believes they will likely not be a threat to us again, but we can deal with them again as needed.  If they are on the ship he will heal them, but right now he's taking a vacation and it will take a week or so.

Fey takes the crates of Gaian parts with her to the Order.  Meets with Llana first.  The souls aren't in these parts, but probably in the main body wherever they are.  She does some DNA testing to see who they are and wants to find out when they disappeared and let their families know what happened.  It is fairly late by the time they get there -- locally dawn of the 7th locally 2 am GST.  

Llana says this is necrophasia, and she thought they were all dead.  Supposedly there is a member of Arcadia that has the ability to do this and their hatred of Soul mechs.  Soul mechs were also affected by Kane as well.  Wondering what happened with Moss.

Llana quickly conceals some emotion about Moss, but then stops.  He was here two days past for help with his condition.  He was able to control his mental faculties.  Not everyone agreed.  So a group of us decided that he was responsible for things that happened in Mars.

Fey asks about the counsel, and Fey says we should gather them.  They are doing things right now.

Some wanted Moss confined, others thought he should be put down.  Hostilities escalated.  Someone took a pot shot at him, he fought back.  Once blood was spilled, he started attacking and raising undead.  He killed all 18 of them and raised them all.

Llana did what she could, but she was the only one to survive.  His power is incomprehensible.  Hard to say if his powers is worse than Kane's, but it is hard to say.  The caretaker has been busy and not very communicative.  Moss' future is uncertain and it is not too late to save him.  He took his ship and left.

Callum -- the name -- sounds familiar, a basilisk maybe says Llana.  Lily Nix was with him.  Hoping she would be a calming influence, but she was egging her on.  The email warning from Fey was never received.

Our best hope for tracking Moss down is divination ward (if something happens, then they are informed).  Unfortunately it requires some outside knowledge of them, since they and his entourage is immune to this.  Not to mention at that time he will have his powers.

Fey turns over the body parts to Llana and she is to inform the counsel and have them start the process of examining the crates.  Fey goes to talk with the caretaker.

Ridge prepares a treatment program and a suitable billing plan for that.  It will be a fair market price, which are high, but not exclusive rich high.  

Malcolm is dropped of in Xanadu.  Malcolm raises Blacksoul in a church, has a soulful talk with him.  Blacksoul leaves in awe and has much to consider.

Ridge talking to her family say they know what they did was wrong, but it just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.  Dr Peters says he's making progress, but this could happen again.

Ridge believes there might be some specialist that can help.

Fey meets with the caretaker.  All the information is passed on.  Waves of calm come from the Caretaker, that her heart was in the right place and has done what she felt was right.  She has not failed.  Life is a tree of possibilities and you can not predict what happens and be punished because it didn't turn out the way it would happen.

Consider what would attract a person like William Moss at this time, and that should lead you to him.  The caretakers has theories but does not tell people what to do.  Note Gaians have been disappearing, not as much from Earth, but from Luna or Mars.  It was always small numbers.

The other plan is going as hoped.  Kane is in a safe place.

Andrew, Fey, Malcolm, and Trenton go Trenton's parents house, where his parents are not there.  The refrigerator has food empty.  The house computer says that they left 15 days ago, around the time we were planting the seed on the sun.

Thinking about his family, there is a place where his parent hid birthday presents where he finds a handwritten note addressed to Trenton.  Dear Trenton, we're sorry we didn't tell you we had to leave, but we couldn't risk the net or where we went as this note could have been found.  Hope to see you again, to explain to you what has happened.  We love you and ....

Trenton internally sense they are still alive.  Fey gets that the direction that they are in is down and to the right, far away, puts them in Japan.

We will deal with Trenton's parents next sesion, but after that we'll assume two weeks or so passes for metagame reasons.  On 12-July Malcolm, Serra, and Trenton receive messages on their computers.

Right now our tentative next session will be going after Moss.
