Rudy, a member of the Arcane Order, teleports Malcolm and Noun to Valhalla.  Iason asks that they not divulge the existence of the Arcane Order to outsiders.

In Valhalla, Malcolm and Noun meet with Queen Mireda, human woman.  She is amused that Malcolm knows so little about its construction.  She tells them as little as possible as she likes it that very few people know about it.  They learn that Pop built his stairway some 200 years ago.  It goes from the Celestial realm to here to the Infernal realm.  Malcolm is welcome to use the stairway as he wishes as it was built for his kind.

The only person from Earth that has used the stairway was Pip, who went to Celestial realm.

Malcolm asks whether any help they might aid.  Her realm is in greater role.  She may be willing to offer some help for a price (if they weather the current crisis).

Malcolm offers his assistance for no cost if the cause is worthy.  Noun asks whether

Take steps to ensure William Moss is planning any action that would oppose the events to come.  The caretaker is doing what is necessary to save all of us, he may no longer care.

The queen would like a trinket from Noun.  What kind?  She collects magical artifacts -- perhaps you heard of them.   There are seven that really matter.  We don't believe we have one, on the contrary, you have one of them

It is the artifact of containment (also called the obelisk or pandora's box).  Noun sends the Queen a diagram. She says she'll give it to her engineers, who might find this useful.  Noun and the Queen talk about the Dragons, how unreasonable they were.  The Queen agrees that being reasonable makes sense as it is beneficial (to her).

The Queen says you look conflicted to Noun, Noun seems to indicate it is true, but the queen says it does not concern you.

Mostly gnomish and dwarven culture.  A little Royal history.   The Royals are busy, (main take is of seeking truth).  Noun sends him the diagram, hmmm.. seems this will require much study.  I will share with others, it seem like it may be relevant.

Malcolm spends time to get a sense of the state of Vahalla.  Malcolm finds that many are prosperous and there is some inequality.  There are some that haven't done as well, but in no means destitude.  The poorest people in Vahalla are worst of then in Europe.  These people are determined, but I'm not sure about what.  Resolute about the coming challenges.

Most are devoted to the caretaker.  There are a variety of religions, but most follow the caretaker.

They all to a Xanadu, work helping the poor and does prayers.  Noun prays to god for help.  He feels some kind of connection in his mind.  It does not feel like the caretaker, but he doesn't know what.  He has a terrified feeling it is a God.  There some level of complexity that he doesn't quite comprehend.  Uh, hi, we're not on good terms, can you open that door?

The presence in his mind is not unlike looking in a mirror and then it slips away.

Malcolm asks Ridge about the message and whether it can be traced.  Ridge tries to figure out what happened, either it was really skillful (unbelievable) or magic.

8th to 13th
In the news the Lupis cannis war has ended.  One was captured, one brother agreed to be under the control of Con and General???  Third brother is supposedly dead, another missing.  The crazy cyborg and his magic consultant, took over a free Russian colony.  A few thousand die (the population is around 9+ million).

13th
Stratco has now declared anyone can be a mystic.  This will allow them to build new better super soldiers.  This is largely due to work of Rudolph Berstein, how happy he is that he can benefit mankind.  It is just a genetic modification to enable the mystic traits.  There are patent concerns, so the technique isn't published.  At first it is for just the extremely well off, and then eventually for the rest.

Arcadia moved back to the Solar system and it is near Canis, then ported to Luna and is headed back into space.

July 18th
Early that morning a terriost who can change form is holding the mystic port hostage.  He's got 200 people encased to die, unless the Merlin Huntington (Con's mystic) is turned over for judgement.  A whole bunch of soldier are sent in and coated in silver stuff.

Huntington and the Monday and Saturday's group shows up on television.   A highly illegal anti-matter weapon.  Zee look a little unhealthy -- still a little tortured.  Meechum looks like a ravenous undead mutant.

Supposedly the terriost was beaten, but he managed to kill all the hostages.  Lupis names the guy a enemy of state, clearly he is terriost dis-satified with the results, when clearly the others were shown to use anti-matter weapon.  Huntington says they were working on their behalf and accepts all consequences that the UN bestows.

Max Smith used the anit-matter weapon, that it was used without our consent and not on our behalf.  He has been suspended from work.

Repairs to the ship is done on the 19th.    On today Magitech was destroyed, Pax Artificum suffers from riots, all the robots frenzy and do crazy things.  Then a ghostly ship shows up and spears the heart tree on Luna, the caretaker became present, everyone felt the presence and the ship just left.

The heart tree has been healed heavily and chances of recover is good.

We recognize the ship as Dee.

Fey and Bullet Train, no communications from them.

Check out on Luna to make sure she is alright.

Ridge is checking with UN for tracking of Moss' ship.

Noun, Andrew, and Trenton go to see Luna.  Pixie guards stop them.  Noun says they are off to see the caretaker.  Pixie says the tree is under repair and no one can pass.  Peters says they mean no harm  Trenton wants to know whether the Luna Cain fusion is going.  The Pixies are offended, Trenton says we've been working with the pixie Fey Arius.  They don't seem to know who Fey is, but they say it was grievesly wounded, and they are healing it, not to worry.

Andrew offers his services as he is a great healer.  They say they have plenty of healers already.  If you tell you our name, we can check to see if you can help.  They pretty much blow him off.  Peters tries to use diplomacy to get in.

Dr Peters asks how is baby Luna.

One of the Pixies tries to touch Peters, but misses.  Dr Peters dodges, but is then touched and is forced to dance and can't do much else.  Trenton pulls his pistol out and tells them to undo what was done.  They say it was too late.

Noun shoots the pixie who casted, but missed.  The Pixie says, hey now, don't be doing that.  Pixies both load a bow and shoots Noun.  He is hit by one arrow, feels a little groggy but shrugs it off.

Pronoun hides his bag,   Noun doesn't knows where one of them are.  Noun sends one of the pixies 15 minutes into the future.

Trenton makes the three invisible, and makes him appear right next to the existing one, leave my friends alone, we're here to check on Luna.  Tells Noun to stand down.

Pixie shoots off and runs away.  In the distance you hear intruders, there everywhere, help help.  The three move towards the heart tree.  Trenton and Peters thinks they should leave.  Noun insists on staying, Peters offers to disable them as he can.  Noun says to press on and see if they try to stop them.

Noun is convinced to see the caretaker on Earth.  Peters sense 8 minds approaching from all directions.  They all start hustling, but Trenton convinces them to slow down.  Some crunching in the woods near by is heard.

A whole bunch of werewolves surround them.  A woman (elf) who was on the news talking about her company that had issues.  Trenton tries to be diplomatic saying hey did nothing.  Noun says they attacked first -- she concedes, but Pixies are pranksters and you must forgive them.

She ensures that the one who did the transgression, will be dealt with appropriately.  Trenton wants to know more about what is going on.  They have been dealing with the caretaker, and saw Luna three weeks ago.

Noun says he works with caretaker -- until a better offer comes along.   Trenton tries to walk the line of "on the fence" with the caretaker.  Dr Peters challenges her, saying that as one forcing them to do their will something something.. essientially she is just as bad and insults her at the same time.  She tells them to leave and not return.

Dr Peters uses mind control to make them dance.  Only two of them dance, she gives Dr Peters a cold glare, they all leave.  She telepathically tells Dr Peters, you have made enemies today.  Trenton tells Dr Peters says that wasn't a very mature thing to do.

One of the werewolves begins to transform, they start moving, the woman tells them to not pursue and they don't.

Ridge checks the systems for records of Moss' ship.  His trajectory indicates further out into the solar system (asteroid belt on Mars or further).  Ridge finds a record on mars net, that the ship passed by Mars, but don't know where after that.  Looking at the trajectory, it is hard to say where.  It passed by Mars around the 6th of July.

Moss has a total of 30 undead including him and Nix as far as we know.  Aracdia is in the asteroid belt and is not moving anymore.

Malcolm uses Discern Location on William Moss.  He feels an extreme expenditure of energy from his soul, into his mind is whispered, Alexandria, Mars colony (get Northern quadrant).  We tap into and can't find any Alexandria on Mars.

Malcolm checks with Sledge about a place called Alexandria on Mars.  No one has hear of it.  The repairs are behind schedule, but there is something funny on that place.  Not suppose to bother the caretaker.  What about Luna?  She's doing good, the caretaker's plans are still moving forward.

Malcolm talks with Nash Mistletoe.  Nash doesn't think there is a place list Alexandria.  I've been going back and forth on the undead on Mars, and it isn't good.  First of all after 70% of undead were recovered, the rest were just gone (dissolved, maybe?  But I doubt it).  Many people have disappeared if they go outside the city and those that are there ramble about ghosts.  Lastly just between me and you, some are there around the clock working on the heart tree.

Nash says to say hi.  Tell her I only talked to you because you knew her.

Some dryads are working on the tree, who are all part of their order (Gaian's Ancient Order).   Malcolm talks with Midguard Royal to see if we can learn about Alexandria.

Noun contacts the caretaker in the future.  It appears as a man (Royal), in ghostly form (6'7") with saintly robes.  Noun goes through a sorry to bother, we need your assistance.  Asks where Alexandria on Mars is, Noun feels a caretaker like feeling (not as strong, but still very significant).  He does not know of this place.  He asks if he knows where Moss is.  He is told the situation on Mars is more dire than the Gaians would lead them to believe.  The corruption in the tree and dripping down the roots into the world.

The world is very bad!  The entity thinks that something must be done, but time grows short.  It can not help now, and it Mars must be sacrificed, then so be.  Noun wants to let it go, but it leave giving a sense that this rapoir is remarkable and he is intrigued.

We take just the Perseverance to Mars.  Laiden scans for undead, especially around the heart tree.  We don't sense for undead, but Serra says after a few minutes is that something strange is going on.  I think there really is undead there, she points out some extremely irregular patterns, guessing there are undead souls here?  And they are moving in and down.

UNF says, you're presence is a surprise, please state your business.  We say we're looking for William Moss.  They say okay, but be careful.  From Midguard, the Queen does not know where Alexandria.  There is probably undead there and it is a good place for him to hide.

Only one domed city -- speck on the planet.  35% is in the parameter, the heart tree is outside of it.

On Mars, Ridge tries to find the Filthy Mongrel on Mars (50 miles away from the city, using varies inside knowledge he has.  She finds the Filthy Mongrel sitting abandoned on the surface of the Mars.   We look at the ship from above, find no one or nothing.

One droid goes in the ship, one looks around outside.  The ship is pretty much what we remember.  There is evidence that the ship is undamaged and just fine.  The droid brings the ship back online with all undead here.

Ridge takes control of the Filthy Mongrel.

We go phased, invisible, down into the heart tree down.   Serra says there is something very wrong with this tree.  Rotting from the inside, but that isn't quite right.  Sensor reading says there are several creatures laying hands on the tree.

We follow a exact path way into Mars for many miles (after 50 miles, the roots branch out in a different way into a cavernous area).  It feels corrupt; all along the floors, walls, there is a corruptive substance (starcraft undead creep).

There are all sorts of zombies (here in this area is 2500).    This place exudes an intense evil aura -- this place is unhallowed.

Serra says there is a problem with the undead, they are looking at us.  Some of them begin shambling our way.  Some shadows begin floating towards us.  They begin arriving in two minutes.  As the mass, Malcolm sunbursts many undead, we fly out quickly.

The tree is barely showing its corruption based on how awful it us underneath.

Malcolm sends email to Nash about the great evil beneath the ground.

Nix stabs Malcolm dropping him to the ground.  You killing my people, now it is my turn to kill you.

Major fight ensues.  Malcolm is dropped.  Then healed by Eli.  Andrew does a healing on floor and Nix whacks her.  Malcolm does a couple healing rain, Trenton shoots her a couple times.

The combat starts to go south for Nix, but a Orange haired leather clad man appears, interposing himself, saying, "I can not allow you to harm [her] any more".  Laiden takes off into the sky.  Ridge takes over her computer jack a little.  He grabs Nix around her neck, pumps dark energy into her and tells us all to "Be gone from my world".
