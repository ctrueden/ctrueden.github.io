Ridge reports the Necropalis to the UN.  Sent information to Gaia's Order.

Noun request view the network that we return to the Arcane Order.   Ridge says sure, we're going back to Earth to report in.  Ridge takes the Filthy Mongrel with us.

Noun tells Laiden that he wants to open the tower.

We all agree to go back to Earth and report, rest, restock and raid the tower.

Send message to UNF asking to see if they require action from them.  UN responds and tells her to send a report to the officer in charge on Mars.  Waterton says that in the future if they are pursuing things this dangerous they should receive permission ahead of time.  He eventually winds down and is clear to leave.

Malcolm asks about where Eli is.  Ridge says he looks to look into himself.  He asks whether this is some sort of mental test.  Ridge explains bluntly that Malcolm died, Eli became goo and melded into him.

Trenton disappears, leaves a note, comes back 2 hours later.  Convenience we arrive at the island of the Santuary.  

Peters and Noun go in.  Wizards are happy to see them.  Woman says, "you've returned".  Noun says he has some new insights and needs to see the tower. Noun walks up to the tower door.  The woman says to not open it, Iason won't be happy.

Noun walks up to the door touches it and says, "open".  Peters and the woman hear all manners of expressions.  Overwhelming mix of everything (happiness, sadness, everything).  All of Peter's senses are overwhelmed.

Noun sees all sorts of connections of time and space connecting, which makes sense but it wrong at this time/place/etc.  The woman is confused, jerks funny and moves backwards.  Many people are sitting here on top of each other in each others way.

The door begins to rapidly open and close (not actually, but in a quantum state).  The tower is growing in height, repeating itself in growing.  Reality is not in an equilibrium state.

Noun tries to step through the door.  As he does he realized he is split in varies states and may or may not be in the tower when things are back in equilibrium.  Noun feels a thunderous clap in his chest taking some damage and finds himself inside the tower.  There are stairs up and stair down.  Noun runs quickly up the stairs and he hears something scraping from below.  Noun runs for a long time until he tires.  He doesn't hear anything behind him.  Something is unique about this place.  Noun looks behind and nothing is there.

The woman wonders what happened.  Peters says that Noun is on the other side of the door.  Peters learns that none of them can open the door.  Noun takes a long time (with multiple rest stops) gets to the top.  As he goes higher it is harder to breath, and as though his body is being deconstructed and as though he soul is being torn from his soul.  The pain is greater with each step.

Noun forces himself up the stairs and he begins to lose perceptions around him.  Peters sees a white light shine down from the top of the tower.

Noun feels himself loosing control this body and this soul.  He is overwhelmed with excruciating pain by the white light and something happens that he doesn't understand.  His soul is being processed -- and something else fails to comprehend Noun, there is no contact.

Noun finds himself somewhere complete unlike somewhere before.  The street is beautiful in all its majestic beauty.  The beings (human-like) are all friendly.  Noun feels strange he doesn't remember much for years.  Last he remembers is that he was in a church and he falls to his knees and gives thanks to the lord.

An older man stops next to him, once he stops praying .  He says it has been a while since we had a human visitor, let me show you around.

Pronoun says begins contemplating the possibilities that Noun doesn't come back.  Pronoun tells Peters that they need to go to the ship and get help to get Noun.

Peters picks up Noun's bag.  Peters tells the crew that Noun went through the door. 

Russell is told that as a member of the living, it is not yet your time.  Russell argues that he wants to meet God and was just in the middle of being baptized.  He suggests that Russell close his eyes and relax will be able to realize God.  

It feel pure, clean, perfect, and understands what he meant about God being everywhere.  Russell wishes to achieve rapture.  Russell stay for a time and reaches and inner peace.   Russell senses the stair beneath him and is ready to go into the world to share the word.

Noun realizes there was time of nothingness and can not perceive time.  After an eternity and Noun feels himself seeping back into his body, and this is not the same body as before.  Like a new car that is exactly the same (model, year, color, etc), but you know it isn't the same.

Noun comes down the stairs wondering what happened.  Why did he black out?  He doesn't  know why.  He begins walking back up the stairs and is experiencing the pain again, as though he can't travel up the stairs.  His body can do it, but Noun just can't for some reason, unknown to himself.  Noun backs off and tries to figure out what is incompatible.   As he thinks more and still doesn't understand it.  Some power was deconstructing the body, deleted, and the soul is no longer here.

The new body was recreated (reincarnated).  Noun was not born in this body, but ended in this place.  The deconstructing of the body could not deconstruct Noun, so it left him here.

When that white light shines down there is an overwhelming outpouring of mystic energy.  Noun tries to contact anything sentient out there.  Concentrating he feels no other entities in the area.  He senses deep within himself another consciousness within himself that is more at peace and it was successful reaching heaven.

Noun reaches inside himself to talk to this other consciousness.  Digging deeply Noun can't glean anything from the soul.  At the bottom there is a glowing portal, and it is path to end of endless possibilities.   Noun closes his eyes and walks through.

Stepping through the portal Noun is pulled through infinite time, spanning across eons.  Noun realizes he might no survive this and snaps himself back together just outside the door of the tower.

Pronoun says that Peters is special as it seems the other wizards don't care (perhaps not even remember).  Peters reaches out to minds and sense one of them is thinking of pudding and whether he can magically create pudding.

Noun goes back to the ship and contemplates himself.  Trenton talks with Noun and not much is understood.

Trenton seems adamant to go to Arcadia.

Malcolm contacts the Ancient Order of Gaians and they are really busy with more important things.  

Peters fills out the forms and buys force field armor.  Trenton picks Dorian up.  There is much discussion about Ponce.  Trenton and Laiden plan to use Ponce as a tool.  Trenton tells Ponce that we're going to Arcadia and that we have his ship.

We reach Arcadia Saturday July 22 (evening).  No defense systems in place, many docks.  We are issued to dock 219.

Arcadia is like Switzerland.  It is really clean.  There are many cleaning bots, so Fey becomes one of those.  This is also a very neutral place.

Ridge sends a message to Fey, no response. One to Bullet Train, no response.  Fey responds back as who are you?  It isn't Fey, it is someone else.  Ridge can tell this is coming from somewhere in Arcadia and they have taken steps so send it though the Arcadia randomizer, to make sure things are anonymous (for a fee).

After some thought, we wait too long, we get a message that, you're one of those from that funky ship, gringo.  Ridge says her ship is big, beat up, normal.

Ridge responds back, if you have her we want her.  I don't suppose you have Ponce Dorian.  Let's just say I know where to find him.  We debate whether we can trade Ponce.  Ridge says it will take time to secure his release.  

Fine.  When we do, tell him he wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for me.  I can't believe I have to get him out of another jam.

Ridge attempts to use the Miller 2 stuff to try to find Fey.

We talk with Noun to have Fey brought to our ship.  Fey begins convulsing, Noun stabilizes her and she is not doing well.  It appears that Fey was in cold sleep.  Peters and Malcolm rush in there and heal her.  

Malcolm wakes her up.

Bullet Train asks around about connections to Pandora's Children.  First he does this by looking to get one of these grafts.  He gets the cold shoulder for a while and they split up.  For few days Fey doesn't find anything.

Bullet train points out a person who seems suspicious.  He follows him into a butcher shop and they go to the back room to talk.  He thinks their going to loose them through the backdoor, and then they talk about the pirate shipments.  Fey creeps forward to follow them, and then the Butcher takes out a knife and slashes her and that's the last thing she remembers.

Fey sort of half wakes up.  We talk to her and she gathers if things are okay and then eventually points out a butcher shop and tells us everything.

Near the butcher shop there is a hospital.  Hernando Dorian owns the butcher shop.

Peters walks in and asks if Ponce remembers him.  Ponce asks if welding him to the floor is really necessary.  Laiden says "yes".  Haven't I proven myself trustworthy, "No".  Andrew knocks Ponce into total stupidity and then makes Ponce him his friend.

Trenton checks with Ponce on whether anyone else is associated with Pandora's children.  Ponce says he hates his brother.

Trenton relays what the email says about "having to save his ass".  Ponce is pissed off  saying he hates that guy.  Ponce claims that he doesn't know whether Hernando is part of the group as they don't talk about it.

Ponce says he tell them he'll tell them about it.  Ponce wants to be released from the floor and wants out.  Peters can't quite calm him down.  Ponce says his brother is a jack ass, always looking after me, just doing to ease his guilty conscience.  I don't really understand it -- always responsible that their dad left them, blah blah blah.

Hernando runs this shop is sometimes they deliver stuff given to him.

They release him from the floor.  

Malcolm communicates with Dorian asking whether Dorian knows of special access.  What sort of secret shop stuff, shops on lake street, the basement level has stuff that no one knows about.  The entry is through some special door that only opens for Hernando.

Ponce fights fiercely, but we strap him back down.  We can't locate Bullet Train.

We get to the butcher shop.  The sombrero guy is working.  Peters eternally charms him.  Peters walks in, fey spins out and finds the secret door -- it is air tight.  Fey searches for cameras and finds some possibly in ceiling tiles (possibly any of the tiles can have cameras).  There are also strange panels on the walls.

Peters and Hernando banter back and forth.  He says we have all sorts of exotic meats here.  Just name it, we probably have it.  Over TP, Peters says he is looking for a number of clean items.  Asks what has he come into recently.  He says there has been some slowing of shipments.

Peters asks about eyes, they see rows of statis chambers.

Three rounds later. Ridge tries to disable the lock, which is of the utmost difficulty.  As we try to open it, barely setting off the detection mechanism.

Trying again, Ridge sets off the alarm, cannons come out the wall.

Laiden steps forward and breathes fire, destroying 15 of the 24 cannons.   One of the cannons hits him, but he doesn't really get hurt.  Laiden is partially dragon.

We all get stuff out and grab the towel and we teleport to the other side of the door.    We open all the doors than are empty.  Fey is returned safetly.  

We all teleport to the ship as a group.
