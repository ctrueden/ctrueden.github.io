William Moss makes it back to Earth:
* Gaia's Order agrees to help Moss
* But some of them (maybe those who are more close-minded or even had family killed in the Cain incident on Mars) feel Moss should confined or even destroyed
* Moss is attacked, and he fights back, killing everyone nearby and raising them as undead
* There is no turning back for him after that; he moves to Mars at Nyx's behest to build his necropolis

DEE is assaulting Pax Artificium, Magitech and the Great Forest:
* His goal is to kill anyone he can, but elves foremost
* Four elves including Seth were already killed by DEE in the elven ships' attacks
* Adana Cassenti is killed in the attack
* DEE maintains his antimatter levels by creating a siphon using Miller2 from the Pax Artificium antimatter reactor
* DEE's ultimate goal is to humiliate Zuul, and prove that he is better than her

Seven artifacts:
* The Shroud of Turin is in Lin Huntington's possession, as the brown cloak that he always wears
* The Ambrosia, which has the potential to cure Harry Bryant's madness, begins to grow as fruit on the Sun's Heart Tree
