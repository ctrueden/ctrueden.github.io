[Most of this session's planning here](talk-20051002)

Admiral Rossner is adamant that they need a defense against this rogue planet. &quot;This threat is unlike anything we have ever seen.&quot; He will argue vigorously that it would be foolish not to have ready every tool at their disposal.

Obviously, all efforts will be made to communicate, but the previous efforts made by Percepi went unanswered as far as any of the scientists on Laboro know (some of whom were collaborating on the probe launch and other related attempts).

(Glaurung is blocking/ignoring all communication, because one of his goals is to keep Dragonstar isolated from outside influences. He will continue to do so -- he doesn't believe they pose any threat to him or his people.)

If the party refuses to go on the mission, then Rossner will send Bradley to do it by himself. Rossner is uncomfortable without any human influence on board the ship, but it seems like the best option to him.

As for cleaning up the nanites, what was once Mercury is utterly massive. No one has been able to fathom a way to restore the planet. The only people who are still alive who might know are the royals with whom McLean was working deep in Midgard. But they have been completely uncooperative with the U.N. Forces investigation thus far (unbeknownst to the admiral, this lack of cooperation is at McLean's behest -- he doesn't want anyone learning about the Occultem Lapidem, or anything else about the grey goo).
