## News

Double-check news at [Events](events) page. Fill in players if they go anywhere with news access.
* See [Talk20060205](talk-20060205) for details on how Pandora's Children have organized a smear campaign against Ridge and soulmechs in general.
* On the 12th, &quot;fortune cookie&quot; emails are received:

    * __Noun__:

From near to far he walked alone
No sign of what he sought
Nor anything at all, he saw
For what he'd lost was naught

&quot;I must find it soon,&quot; he swore
&quot;This nothing I require&quot;
But all he saw was everything
and not his heart's desire

He smiled as it came to him
The answer crystal clear
The final words he ever thought
&quot;I am not really here&quot;

    * __Serra__: &quot;A blessing on those who give ear to the prophet's words, and keep the things which he has put in the book, for the time is near.&quot; (Revelation 1:3)

    * __Malcolm__: &quot;The path of humble penitence reveals two roads to heaven: one of absolution, one of disillusion. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.&quot; (final sentence: Matthew 24:35)


## What Dorian knows

* The other two captains are members of Pandora's Children, an anti-soulmech order. They were both taking orders from someone else at the base. Dorian, however, is not a member, but performed his end of the bargain in exchange for a necrophagic graft.
* Ponce Dorian knows only the name of his contact on Arcadia: &quot;Butler.&quot; Butler is an AI, who manages preparing the individuals for surgery. He also handles negotiation and payment.


## Malcolm loses his powers

Because he killed a wounded, unarmed man, his powers begin to malfunction. Those he has healed (Noun, Arial) begin to develop festering blisters. Noun is strong and manages to survive, but Arial dies if Malcolm heals her again.

Within a few days, his powers have failed completely.

Malcolm receives a prophecy on the 12th with a hint about how to restore them (see above).

He can restore them with meditation and prayers for 17 days.


## Damage to the Perseverance

Though they fixed up the ship, those repairs were short-term. It still needs more long-term repairs. Those will take several weeks' time to complete.


## Noun's recovery of Pronoun

By passing a Knowledge: Continuum check DC 30 and performing a long ritual (12 days of seclusion), he can key a newly created Bag to the same pocket in the Continuum that he did before, to recover Pronoun.


## Ridge's family

They need to be examined to determine how they were brainwashed, and hopefully cured. Given time (three weeks of treatments), Dr. Peters can repair their minds, using his abilities.


## Arcadia

* Boris Derrota -- kingpin and economic superpower; suspects his brother's agenda and is monitoring him closely; asks the party to watch Josef in exchange for information about Pandora's Children &amp; the Brotherhood
* Annika Derrota -- mysterious and reclusive; __TODO__
* Josef Derrota -- recently joined Boris's organization; covertly working to topple his brother's empire
* Lincoln Evans -- drug dealer; big muscly guy, wears lots of jewelry; crosses his arms a lot; outgoing, says &quot;Ayup&quot; and &quot;Nope&quot; a lot
* Norris Harrison -- runs the &quot;pawn shop&quot; (huge block of warehouses; largest concentration of stolen goods in the galaxy); wears a felt hat over his shaved head and constantly adjusts it; reserved, says &quot;Hmm&quot; and &quot;I'll see what I can do&quot; a lot
* Felicia Worthington -- a fence, and one of Boris's informants; plump woman with a mohawk and lots of cybernetic body art; fidgets constantly, probably on drugs; rude, says &quot;Fuck off&quot; and &quot;I ain't payin' for that&quot; a lot
* Strife (Laura Morningbird) -- travels to Arcadia to continue the Pandora's Children agenda
* Maxim Signaevsky -- __TODO__

## Magitech's bounty on Laiden

Two of the Cassenti children are devoted to tracking down and taking custody of Laiden and his ship.

Arthin and Tira Nightshade are twin bounty hunters sent after Laiden. They are not the most noble of the elves. In fact, they have a cruel streak, and are savoring every moment of their &quot;Laiden hunt.&quot; They strike against him when he leaves the ship in Arcadia. They hit him with an enervin/tranquilizer shot (Fort save DC 20 for the enervin, DC 15 for the tranquilizer -- except that Laiden is immune to sleep). Since he'll still be up, they attack him directly, gladly.

Arthin:

Creat 1, Destr 1, Dis 1, Div 1, Enh 10, Heal 1, Ill 5, Kin 5, Mind 1, Pyro 9, Trans 1, Res 23

## Moss and Nyx on Mars

Fey, if she inquires as to William Moss on Earth, learns that things spiraled out of control:
* William Moss makes it back to Earth
* Gaia's Order agrees to help Moss
* But some of them -- those who are more close-minded or had family killed in the Cain incident on Mars, led by a basilisk called Calum (Gaelic for &quot;hardness on the skin&quot;) -- feel Moss should be confined or even destroyed
* Moss is attacked, and he fights back, killing everyone nearby and raising them as undead
* There is no turning back for him after that; he moves to Mars at Nyx's behest to build his necropolis


## Brotherhood/Pandora's Children plotline, relation to Trenton

See [Talk20060205](talk-20060205) for details.


## Technofearful

* Ordered by the UNF to travel to Wolf 359 (as one of the 42 ships) to oppose the Technofearful; Trenton can act as an intermediary between opposing forces; possible joint session with Saturday
