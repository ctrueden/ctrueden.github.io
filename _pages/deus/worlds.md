### Colonies in orbit vs. colonies on planetary surfaces

Realistically, it might [make more sense](http://www.permanent.com/s-orbit.htm) to construct artificial, orbital colonies in space, rather than settling on existing alien landscapes. After all, orbital colonies (&quot;[space settlements](http://members.aol.com/oscarcombs/spacsetl.htm)&quot;) have [many advantages](http://members.aol.com/oscarcombs/gallery.htm), and are more technologically feasible (more [realistic in our near future](http://www.permanent.com/s-future.htm)) than surface colonies are.

However, in Deus Ultionis they lack one crucial feature: they have no core of mass sufficient to support mystic saturation. Thus, magic on these colonies is not possible. Still, many of them have been built. But colonists must choose between the convenience of magic versus pure technology. Much research has been done into both colonization techniques, and both are feasible. But the largest colonies are on planetary surfaces, and thus they are discussed in more detail.


### Planetary bodies orbiting Sol

There are nine planets orbiting our sun, as well as several associated planetary bodies such as moons. Objects of note include:
* [Earth](http://www.nineplanets.org/earth.html) (sphere level 20). Population: 24 billion.
* [Luna](http://www.nineplanets.org/luna.html), Earth's moon -- Infused in 2124. About 1/6 normal gravity (sphere level 15).
    * Population of Pax Artificium: 5.4 million.
    * Population of Lunar City: 25.3 million.
    * Total population (including Pax, Lunar City and 57 other cities): 602 million.
* [Mars](http://www.nineplanets.org/mars.html) -- Infused in 2255. About 1/3 normal gravity (sphere level 18). Population: 6.1 million. Founder: Sarah Morningcrow, a werewolf (Gaian).
* [Mercury](http://www.nineplanets.org/mercury.html) -- Infused in 2280. About 2/5 normal gravity (sphere level 18). Population: 877 thousand. Founder: [Mercabah Corporation](org-mercabah).
* [Pluto](http://www.nineplanets.org/pluto.html) and its large moon Charon -- Thus far deemed unsuitable for colonization, since their surfaces are in continual darkness and compensating for the temperature differential has proven too difficult.
* [Jupiter](http://www.nineplanets.org/jupiter.html), [Saturn](http://www.nineplanets.org/saturn.html), [Uranus](http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html) and [Neptune](http://www.nineplanets.org/neptune.html) -- Too massive to support mystic colonization, since Terrans are unable to carry large enough quantities of mystic energy to the planets to infuse them.
* [Venus](http://www.nineplanets.org/venus.html) -- Scientists are still researching key technologies for its colonization. But it has not yet been accomplished due to Venus's violent storms, and the fact that its mass is fairly close to that of Earth. To infuse enough mystic energy, a large portion of Earth's mystic energy would need to be repeatedly extracted and stored over time (giving Earth time to replenish its reserves). This process would need to be repeated until a sufficient quantity of mystic energy had been extracted. Still, analysts predict Venus will be colonized within thirty years.


### Nearby solar systems and their colonies

There are [twelve known stellar objects](http://www.solstation.com/stars/s10ly.htm) within ten light years of [Sol](http://www.solstation.com/stars/sol.htm), belonging to seven solar systems.

{img src=http://www.solstation.com/stars/s10ly2.jpg width=408 height=291 align=&quot;center&quot; desc=&quot;Seven nearest star systems&quot;}

These systems are:
* [Alpha Centauri 3](http://www.solstation.com/stars/alp-cent3.htm). First closest at 4 LY away.
* [Barnard's Star](http://www.solstation.com/stars/barnards.htm). Second closest at 6 LY away.
* [Wolf 359](http://www.solstation.com/stars/wolf359.htm). Third closest at 8 LY away.
* [Lalande 21185](http://www.solstation.com/stars/la21185.htm). Fourth closest at 8 LY away.
* [Sirius 2](http://www.solstation.com/stars/sirius2.htm). Fifth closest at 9 LY away.
* [Luyten 726-8 AB (UV Ceti)](http://www.solstation.com/stars/luy726-8.htm). Sixth closest at 9 LY away.
* [Ross 154](http://www.solstation.com/stars/ross154.htm). Seventh closest at 10 LY away.

Four mystic colonies outside our solar system have been settled:
* __Lupus__ (''loo'' pus) -- A planet orbiting Wolf 359. Infused in 2265. About 1/2 normal gravity (sphere level 19). Population: 8.4 million. Founder: [Khan Ji Tae](npc-khan), a Korean general (human).
* __Percepi__ (''purr'' seh pee) -- A planet orbiting Lalande 21185. Infused in 2270. About 3/5 normal gravity (sphere level 19). Percepi is known for its distinguished institution of higher learning, the Percepi Academy, its love of fine arts, and active academic research in a variety of fields. Population: 4.6 million. Founder: Anatole Beck, a professor of mathematics (royal).
* __Laboro__ (la ''bore'' oh) -- A planet orbiting Lalande 21185. Infused in 2271. About 1/5 normal gravity (sphere level 16). Laboro is closer to the sun than Percepi is, with a much tighter orbit. It is very mineral-rich, and is mainly known for the raw materials it exports. The lifestyles of Percepi and Laboro are largely at odds. Population: 10.2 million. Founder: Gemli Graven, a miner of minerals (dwarven).
    * 46 days per year, 30 hours per day; different days have differing amounts of daylight
* __Canis__ (''cane'' iss) - A planet orbiting [4.6 AU from Sirius A](http://www.exoplaneten.de/sirius/english.html). Infused in 2277. About 3/4 Earth gravity (sphere level 19). Population: 9.5 million. Founder: [Mikhael Volokhov](npc-volokhov), a Russian collector of antiquities (human).
