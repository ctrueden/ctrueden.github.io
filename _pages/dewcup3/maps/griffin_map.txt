Griffin's map

500 x 500 x 500 foot cube

Each wall is an invisible, artifact-level teleportation field, transporting anyone who touches it to the corresponding opposite wall.  Also, the entire arena is affected by a permanent, artifact-level Air Walk effect.

There are eight starting positions, each 125 feet across all axes, one from each of the cube's eight corners.

The arena is fully lit by natural daylight.
