NOR's map

500 x 500 x 500 cube

At 250 foot high, there is a floating platform 250 x 250 in size, in the center of the arena. At the four corners are 10 x 10 platforms. These are the four starting positions. The four platforms are interconnected by 1 foot beams running from the center of each platform to the center of each other platform (including the diagonals). All platforms are artifact-level material that cannot be affected in any way. Each platform has a can of Mountain Dew (alchemical in nature) that removes all magical effects for the imbiber. This effect is an artifact-level dispel, affecting ALL magical effects automatically.

At the bottom of the arena is a 10 foot deep pool of water with calm surface. At the surface of the water is an artifact-level dispel magic field. The field causes anything passing into or out of the water to have all magical effects automatically dispeled. The water is breathable as normal air.

The arena has natural light with no impediments to visibility.
