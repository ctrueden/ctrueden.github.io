Jon versus Nate
DM is Curtis
Start time is 1:05 am
Map is Curtis's #2 map (fields)
Starting positions: Jon is 3, Nate is 1

Initiative: Nate is 11, Jon is 20, Jon's Dragon is 7.

Round one
---------
Jon (20):
Delay until either Nate does something, or the dragon's turn.

Nate (11+):
Uncork the Eversmoking Bottle and it put it in his pouch.

Jon (8):
I will actually go immediately before my dragon.  As a move-equivalent action I will put away my lance.  Then, as free actions, I will pull a copper coin from my haversack as a free action and pull out Wand of darkness from the haversack also.  Then drop the copper coin.  With my Standard action I will cast Darkness on the copper coin using the wand.

Dragon (7):
On my Dragon's turn we will move back 10' so that we are on the edge of the field.

Round two
---------
Nate (11):
Refocus to 24.

Jon (8):
I will prepare an action that if he leaves the field and my dragon charges him, I bash him with my shield.

Dragon (7):
Dragon will 5' step back (out of the field) and will prepare an action to do a partial charge at Nate as soon as he leaves the field.

Round three
-----------
Nate (24):
Pulls out a Brown Bear from his Bag of Tricks. It appears five feet in front of him (toward Jon).

Jon (8):
I put Dust of Disappearance on myself, and take out my Lance as my move-equivalent action.

Dragon (7):
My Dragon moves to the far-right corner and prepares an action to use its breath weapon if anything comes within range.

Round four
----------
Bear (24):
Charges toward dragon, bumping into field #4's northwest corner. It growls and shakes its head.

Nate (24):
Move to southern edge of field.
The smoke from Nate's bottle has grown enough now to obscure a 40 foot area around Nate. He can no longer see the dragon.

Jon (8):
1 \/\/1|| P\/\//\/><0r |-|1/\/\ |1|<3 @ /\/008.

Dragon (7):
Dragon is going to breathe acid on the bear.  This would constitute an attack, I'm guessing, so it gets to make 2 saves, one Will for dragon fear, one Reflex for acid.  Bear fails both saves, and looks scared.  That poor thing!  It then gets splatted with acid and takes 29 damage.  It started with 72 HP, and now has 43 left.

Round five
----------
Bear (24):
Runs scared from the dragon, dripping acid, toward Nate.  Smacks into Nate's field, and whimpers.

Nate (24):
Moves to the center of the arena.  Remaining fields go down.
Activates Monk's Belt (Haste).
Begins activating gaseous form (ninja ability) with remaining partial action (doing so is a full-round action).

Jon (8):
I prepare an action to shield bash him when my dragon gets there.

Dragon (7):
My dragon charges.  Jon bashes Nate with the shield.  Nate is annihilated.
