snippet: A horrific Monopoly/D&amp;D crossbreed.
---

Dungeonopoly is a horrific Monopoly/D&D crossbreed. The game is an extension of Monopoly, played with the same basic rules. However, each character on the board takes on a classic D&D class, and uses her powers to thwart her enemies.

## 1 – Introduction and basic rules

Dungeonopoly utilizes all the normal Monopoly rules, with additional rules described below. Before you begin, be certain you are familiar with the regular Monopoly rules. Familiarity with the D&D 3rd edition rule set is also useful, but not required.

The following additional basic rules are in effect when playing Dungeonopoly:

1.  When landing on GO, collect $400 instead of the normal $200—even if due to the "Advance to GO" card.

2.  When paying a fee such as a Chance or Community Chest penalty, Income Tax, Luxury Tax, or the $50 jail fee, place the money in the "central pot" in the center of the board. Anyone landing on "Free Parking" collects this money.

3.  Players may purchase houses and hotels only during their own turns. They may sell houses and hotels, and mortgage property, only during their own turns, or when forced to raise additional cash. These limits avoid many problems, exploits and ambiguities surrounding off-turn transactions.

4.  Each player needs a d20 and a pewter figurine of her character to play.

5.  Each player chooses a character class from those described below. Multiclassing is not allowed.

6.  Characters begin play as level 1 of their chosen class, and character levels range from 1 through 10.

7.  For every 10 EP gained, a new level is achieved.

8.  Characters gain 1 EP for each of the following:
    *   Purchasing property from the bank
    *   Paying rent on an opponent's property
    *   Successfully using a class ability
    *   Rolling doubles
    *   Rolling 7 ("lucky seven")
    *   Collecting money from passing, or landing on, GO

9.  When one character damages another, the defender pays the bank $20 times the level of the attacker. If the defender has insufficient cash on hand, she must pursue all the usual channels to pay her debt. If she still cannot pay, she is bankrupt.

10. There are a few technical terms which help to describe abilities succinctly:
    *   "_Single use only_" - These abilities may only be used once each time around the board. Passing GO clears these abilities for another use.
    *   "_Limited range_" - If the user is level four or less, these abilities can target a character on the same square, or up to one square away in either direction. If the user is between levels five and eight, they can target a character up to two squares away. If the user is level nine or ten, they can target a character up to three squares away.
    *   "_Line of sight_" - These abilities can target a character on the same edge of the board. If the user is on a corner square, she counts as on both adjoining edges.
    *   "_Enchantment effect_" - These abilities leave a lasting impression which can be targeted by certain other abilities such as Counterspell.
    *   "_Mental effect_" - These abilities target a character's mind. Certain characters (e.g., Ascended clerics) are immune to such effects.
    *   "_Hidden_" - A hidden character is immune to spells and abilities that target her. Thus, she cannot be attacked, nor can she be affected by Magic Missile, Charm Person, Telekinesis or Holy Smite, although Fireball would still damage her since it does not target her specifically.

11. All spells are single use only. Unless otherwise noted, spells can be cast either before or after moving, but only one spell can be cast per turn, even if doubles are rolled. If casting before moving, the spell must be cast before rolling dice for movement. Casting between movement rolls (if doubles are rolled) is allowed, but casting on the way to jail—e.g., after rolling doubles for the third time—is not. Some spells have specific conditions which allow them to be cast during another character's turn; such castings do not count toward the one spell per turn limit.

12. "In jail" is a special square. _**A character in jail does not collect rent on her properties**_. Two people in jail do not count as being on the same square, or even on the same edge of the board—each character is in an isolated cell. Spellcasting in jail is not allowed, nor is casting a spell at someone who is in jail—the cells have antimagic fields. Thus, a fighter cannot use Far Shot on anyone from within the jail, nor can she use it to hit someone who is in jail. Someone in jail is also safe from the fighter's Combat Reflexes ability, as well as from spells such as Telekinesis and Holy Smite.

## 2 – Core classes

The following four classes comprise the core of the Dungeonopoly rule set. Any additional classes introduced should be balanced against the capabilities of the core classes.

### 2.1 – Fighter

Fighters excel at dealing damage, debilitating their opponents' properties and strengthening their own.

#### Fighter abilities

At level 1, the fighter begins with the "**Attack**" ability. When on the same square as an opponent, either before or after moving, the fighter may damage that opponent.

At level 2, the fighter gains the "**Run**" ability. Before her first movement roll of the turn, the fighter may choose to run, granting her an extra 1d6 of movement. For the purposes of determining doubles, roll the usual 2d6 first, then the extra 1d6—or use color-coded dice. If the fighter chooses to run, she cannot use any other class abilities during that turn.

At level 3, the fighter gains the "**Far Shot**" ability. Once per turn, either before or after moving, she can invoke this ability to damage an opponent at least one square away within line of sight. The shot can miss, however—chance of success is 10% per level. If the shot misses, no EP is earned for its use.

At level 4, the fighter gains the "**Intimidate**" ability. Whenever she owes rent, she may attempt to intimidate the landlord so that she does not have to pay. To do so, she must roll her level or less on a d20\. If she fails, she does not earn EP for using the ability and she must pay rent normally.

At level 5, the fighter can use "**Combat Reflexes**" to attack (and therefore damage) an opponent as she passes that opponent while moving on her turn. That is, she no longer needs to land on the same square as her opponent to attack.

At level 6, the fighter can "**Raze**" enemy buildings. Whenever she lands on an opponent's property with one or more houses, she automatically destroys one of the houses. Hotels are immune to razing.

At level 7, the fighter can "**Fortify**" her own property. Whenever she lands on her own property, she can add a house, to a maximum of four. Four houses cannot be fortified into a hotel, and the fighter cannot purchase a property and fortify it on the same turn—that is, it must be her when she lands on it. Mortgaged properties cannot be fortified. The fighter need not have a monopoly to fortify a given property.

At level 8, the fighter can "**Conquer**" opponents' property. Whenever she lands on an opponent's mortgaged property, she gains control of it—i.e., the title transfers to her. She need not pay any transfer fees, although the property remains mortgaged.

At level 9, the fighter gains "**Veteran**" status. When damaged, she pays half the usual amount. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 10, the fighter gains the "**Abundant Step**" ability. Instead of rolling for movement, she may choose to move forward one to four squares. This ability is single use only. The fighter does not count as passing over any squares that get crossed, although she does count as having landed on the destination square. The fighter cannot use "Combat Reflexes" while using Abundant Step, nor can she use "Far Shot" unless it is following a normal move that same turn (which can only happen when doubles are rolled).

#### Fighter tactics

*   Use Run often as soon as you learn it. You'll earn EP quickly, and pass GO often.
*   Don't forget about Intimidate! Having rent fees waived often is extremely valuable.
*   Use both Combat Reflexes and Far Shot to damage someone with Mage Armor or Shield of Faith active.
*   Once you learn Abundant Step, use it in combination with the tactical abilities Raze, Fortify and Conquer.

### 2.2 – Wizard

Wizards have a variety of useful spells in their arsenal.

#### Wizard abilities

Wizards begin play with one spell, and obtain another spell each time they gain a level.

At level 1, the wizard begins with "**Magic Missile**." This spell damages an opponent within limited range.

At level 2, the wizard learns "**Expeditious Retreat**." Before a movement roll, she may cast this spell to double the results of the next movement roll this turn.

At level 3, the wizard learns "**Mage Armor**." After casting this spell she is protected, and does not take damage the next time she normally would. Mage Armor cannot be stacked—that is, casting it twice does not protect from the next two attacks. Mage Armor is an enchantment effect.

At level 4, the wizard learns "**Slow**." This spell slows a character within limited range. The next time that character rolls for movement, she rolls only 1d6 instead of 2d6\. A slowed fighter who runs rolls only 2d6 instead of 3d6, and since one of these dice is an "extra" die, the fighter cannot roll doubles or lucky seven. A slowed rogue who sneaks moves only half as far—1 square on a roll of 1 or 2, 2 squares on a roll of 3 or 4, or 3 squares on a roll of 5 or 6\. Slow is an enchantment effect.

At level 5, the wizard learns "**Invisibility**." Before a movement roll, she may cast this spell to become unseen. During that turn's movement, she does not count as passing over or landing on any squares—his figurine moves, but there are no consequences to the move: she owes no rent, collects no money from passing GO, etc. Invisibility is an enchantment effect.

Until her next turn, the wizard is considered hidden.

At level 6, the wizard learns "**Charm Person**." This spell charms an opponent within limited range. The next time the wizard owes rent money to that opponent, the opponent must waive the fee. Charm Person is a mental enchantment effect.

At level 7, the wizard learns "**Counterspell**." This spell dispels an enchantment within limited range. Thus, the wizard could use it to dispel Bless or Curse from the current property, Charm Person from herself, Mage Armor or Shield of Faith from an opponent on the same square, etc.

Alternately, she can cast Counterspell to cancel out a spell being cast by another character anywhere on the board. Since casting in this manner happens during a different character's turn, it does not count toward the one spell per turn limit.

Note that Counterspell targets spells and enchantments, not the character casting them—hence, a cleric with Shield of Faith active can still have her spells countered, and a cleric protected by Sanctuary can have the Sanctuary dispelled.

At level 8, the wizard learns "**Fireball**." When cast, all houses and hotels on the current square are destroyed, unless the property is blessed. In addition, all opponents on that square take damage. If rent is owed, payment must be made before the buildings are destroyed.

At level 9, the wizard learns "**Telekinesis**." Any character on the board may be targeted, including the wizard herself. The targeted character moves between one and five squares, either forward or backward. The character does count as passing over any squares that get crossed—so passing GO and collecting $200 due to Telekinesis is possible. However, the character does not count as having landed on the final square. Thus, using Telekinesis to push an opponent three spaces back onto a property with a hotel does not cause that opponent to owe rent for that property. In the case of landing on GO with telekinesis, collect $200 for "passing" GO but not the extra $200 for landing on it.

At level 10, the wizard learns "**Wish**." She can cast it to duplicate the effects of any other spell of any class. Alternatively, when the current square is already owned, the wizard may use Wish to place a hotel on the property, even if it is not part of a monopoly. Wish has a $500 casting cost.

#### Wizard tactics

*   Use Expeditious Retreat often as soon as you learn it. You'll pass GO more quickly.
*   To protect yourself against enemies, especially the brutal fighter, have Mage Armor active whenever possible. If an opponent is continually hassling you, control your movement with Expeditious Retreat or Slow to escape her, or use Invisibility to hide from her.
*   Use Slow on an opponent nearing your improved properties, to increase her chances of landing there. Or, use it on yourself when nearing a desirable square such as Free Parking, GO or Boardwalk.
*   Control your movement through enemy properties with Expeditious Retreat, Slow and Telekinesis.
*   Use Invisibility to avoid paying rent on particularly devastating improved properties.
*   Keep all your opponents charmed whenever possible.
*   Use Counterspell, Fireball and Wish to make deals with opponents. Threaten to destroy all their houses, offer to dispel an enemy Curse, or even place a hotel on their property, in exchange for money, property or services.
*   Use Telekinesis to maneuver an opponent to a location with the greatest chance of landing on your improved properties—seven squares away is statistically most likely.
*   Study the cleric spells as well, since Wish can duplicate any cleric spell.

### 2.3 – Cleric

The cleric is chosen by the gods, granted holy powers and blessings.

#### Cleric abilities

Clerics begin play with one spell, and obtain other spells and powers as they advance in level.

At level 1, the cleric begins play with the "**Bless**" spell. When cast, the current property becomes blessed, yielding an additional 5% rent per level of the cleric, rounded down. Hence, a property normally yielding $650 in rent would bring in $747 if blessed by a level 3 cleric. In addition, a blessed property is immune to effects that destroy buildings, such as the wizard's "Fireball" and the fighter's "Raze." If cast on a cursed land, Bless simply dispels the curse. Bless is an enchantment effect and has a $50 casting cost.

Alternately, the cleric can invert the spell and cast it as a "**Curse**." When cast, the current property becomes cursed, yielding 5% less rent per level of the cleric, rounded up. Hence, a property normally yielding $650 in rent would bring in $553 if cursed by a level 3 cleric. If cast on a blessed land, Curse simply dispels the blessing. Curse is an enchantment effect and has a $50 casting cost

At level 2, the cleric learns the "**Shield of Faith**" spell. After casting this spell, she is protected. The next time someone either damages her or casts a spell at her (e.g., Magic Missile, Charm Person or Telekinesis) she is unaffected. Shield of Faith cannot be stacked—that is, casting it twice does not protect from the next two attacks or spells. Shield of Faith is an enchantment effect.

At level 3, the cleric learns the "**Sanctuary**" spell. After casting the spell, the cleric is invulnerable until her next turn. She cannot be targeted by any class abilities, nor can she take damage. If cast before moving, the cleric forfeits her movement roll. Sanctuary is an enchantment effect.

At level 4, the cleric gains a new power, "**Divine Favor**." She no longer needs to pay most fees. She can ignore Luxury Tax and Income Tax payments, as well as choose whether to accept the consequences of any Community Chest and Chance cards she draws. However, she still pays the $50 jail fee to get out of jail. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 5, the cleric learns the "**Holy Smite**" spell. When cast, it damages an opponent, regardless of her position on the board—although it cannot be used to damage someone in jail.

At level 6, the cleric learns the "**Divine Intervention**" spell. Any time dice are rolled, she can cast this spell to discard the result and require a reroll. If she casts this spell to reroll a roll during her own turn, it counts toward the one spell per turn limit.

At level 7, the cleric gains a new power, "**Divine Power**." Whenever she passes a Chance or Community Chest square, she draws the card. Divine Favor applies as usual for choosing whether to accept each card. If the card is a movement card (e.g., "Advance to GO") and the cleric accepts it, movement occurs from the associated Chance or Community Chest square, and the remainder of the cleric's movement roll is discarded.

In addition, whenever she passes the Free Parking square, she collects the money from the central pot—she no longer needs to land on the square.

This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 8, the cleric learns the "**Glyph of Warding**" spell. Casting this spell leaves behind a glyph on the current property. The next character to pass over the property with the glyph stops on that square, forfeiting any remaining movement—treat it as though the character landed on that square. In addition, the affected character takes damage. In the case of a character being moved with Telekinesis over a glyph, the character still does not count as landing on the square. Glyph of Warding is an enchantment effect and has a $150 casting cost.

At level 9, the cleric gains "**Ascended**" status. She is immune to mental effects (e.g., Charm Person), as well as any effect that would send her to jail. In the case of three consecutive doubles rolls, the cleric moves the result of the third roll but does not roll a fourth time. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 10, the cleric learns the "**Wrath of God**" spell. When cast, all opponents are damaged—even hidden ones. Furthermore, all opponents' properties lose one house. A property with a hotel is downgraded to four houses. Unimproved properties are unaffected. Wrath of God has a $300 casting cost.

#### Cleric tactics

*   Use Bless/Curse to make deals with opponents. Offer them the chance to get their property blessed for a fee, or threaten to curse their property if they won't meet your demands.
*   To stay protected from your enemies, especially the brutal fighter, have Shield of Faith active whenever possible. If a fighter is continually hassling you, use Sanctuary before your movement to protect yourself, and to increase the likelihood of her passing you.
*   Don't forget about Divine Favor and Divine Power. Those Community Chest and Chance bonuses really add up.
*   Use Holy Smite when an opponent is low on cash to force her to sell houses or mortgage property.
*   Use Divine Intervention to force a lucky opponent to reroll if she escapes landing on your improved properties. Or use it on yourself to avoid landing on an opponent's improved property.
*   Place Glyphs of Warding on your improved properties to increase the chances of your opponents landing there. Or offer to place a glyph on an opponent's property in exchange for a fee.

### 2.4 – Rogue

The rogue is wily and crafty, stealing what she needs to survive.

### Rogue abilities

Rogues begin play with 30 points to distribute throughout their skills. Each time they gain a level, 5 more points become available for distribution. Because thievery always involves a degree of risk, no skill may have more than 15 ranks.

To use a skill, the rogue must pass a skill check by rolling less than or equal to her ranks in that skill on a d20\. The rogue only receives EP for using the skill if she is successful.

The rogue's skills are:

*   "**Open Locks**" is the skill for escaping jail. When in jail, the rogue can use this skill to leave without paying the usual $50\. She can attempt to escape on the same turn she is imprisoned, as well as at the beginning of any subsequent turn. She can also use this skill to release other characters from jail when she is on the Just Visiting square. A separate skill check is required for each character to be released. Only one attempt can be made per character each turn.

*   "**Pick Pockets**" is the skill for stealing money from other characters. Whenever the rogue is on the same square as another character, she can use this skill to attempt to pick the pockets of that character. If successful, she takes $20 per level from the opponent's cash on hand. If the opponent has insufficient cash on hand, the rogue simply takes what she can get. If she fails the skill roll, the rogue goes to jail. The rogue can also use this skill on an opponent while sneaking past—see the Sneak skill below. Only one attempt can be made per character each turn.

*   "**Rob Bank**" is the skill for stealing money from the bank. When the rogue passes GO, she can attempt to obtain additional money using this skill. If successful, she takes an extra $50 per level. When landing on GO, success yields an extra $100 per level. If she fails, however, she forfeits her entire GO bonus and goes to jail.

*   "**Sneak**" is the skill for moving stealthily. Instead of rolling movement normally, the rogue can opt to sneak with a successful skill check. She rolls only 1d6 for movement. During that move, she does not count as passing over or landing on any squares—that is, her figurine moves, but there are no consequences to the move—she owes no rent, collects no money from passing GO, etc.

    While sneaking past an opponent, she may choose to **Backstab** that opponent, damaging her and earning an additional EP. She may also pick pockets if desired, although she faces the usual penalties for failure—see the Pick Pockets skill above.

    After sneaking, a rogue is considered hidden until her next turn.

    Lastly, after moving, she may choose not to hide, so that she still counts as having landed on the current property. If the rogue "comes out of sneak" in this fashion, she must face all normal consequences of landing on the current property, and she is no longer hidden until her next turn.

*   "**Steal**" is the skill for robbing property of valuables. When on a property with at least one house, the rogue may use this skill to loot the place, stealing 5% of the property's rent per level, rounded down. The rogue receives this money from the property owner, who must take all the usual actions to generate enough money, or else she goes bankrupt. If the rogue fails her skill roll, she must pay rent on the property normally if she has not done so already, then go to jail.

#### Rogue tactics

*   Max out Rob Bank early in the game. Traverse the board as quickly as possible to pass GO often, for more chances to line your pockets and gain EP.
*   Do not develop Steal until later in the game, when improved properties become more common.
*   Do not overuse Sneak, especially early in the game when there are few harmful squares. It will slow your movement to a crawl and stunt your EP growth. Instead, use Sneak later in the game to land on opponents' improved properties without paying rent, then Steal from them.
*   Take advantage of several opponents in a cluster within six squares ahead of you. Sneak, then Backstab and Pick Pockets each one as you pass. Since you can Backstab and Pick Pockets in either order, consider the pros and cons of each. Pick Pockets followed by Backstab might run the opponent out of cash and force her to sell houses or mortgage property, but runs the risk of going to jail before earning the Backstab EP. The other order earns a safe EP and does guaranteed damage, but may result in less money from Pick Pockets if the opponent is low on cash.
*   When on Just Visiting, release characters in jail using Open Locks, then pick their pockets.
*   Don't forget to "come out of sneak" when landing on desirable properties such as Free Parking and GO.
*   A failed Pick Pockets or Steal attempt sends you to jail, safe from opponents' abilities and properties. A subsequent successful Open Locks earns EP.

## 3 – Additional class options

### 3.1 – Bard

The bard sings sweet songs, lulling her opponents into a false sense of security.

#### Bard abilities

At level 1, the bard begins play the "**Bardic Music**" ability. The bard may activate this ability whenever a character—including the bard herself—owes rent with the bard present on that rental property. The bard performs a melody which alters details of the transaction. She begins play with one melody, chosen from the following list:

*   "**Inspire Courage**" - The bank pays half the rent owed on behalf of the character.
*   "**Cutting Words**" - After rent is paid, the property owner takes damage.
*   "**Song of Freedom**" - After rent is paid, the character advances to Free Parking, collecting $200 if she passes GO.
*   "**Inspire Greatness**" - After rent is paid, the character rolls 2d6 and moves forward that many squares. Characters count as passing over and landing on squares as usual.
*   "**Song of Rest**" - After rent is paid, the character's turn immediately ends, with no opportunity to use abilities, or roll again in the case of doubles. The character regains all single-use abilities.
*   "**Frightening Tune**" - After rent is paid, the character rolls 1d6 and flees backward that many squares. Characters count as passing over and landing on squares as usual.
*   "**Dirge of Doom**" - The rent owed is doubled. In the case of blessed or cursed property, adjust for the blessing/curse first, then double the result.

Only one melody may be used per activation of Bardic Music. In the case of multiple characters owing rent on a property simultaneously (e.g., due to the Mass Suggestion spell), the bard performs only a single bardic melody, which applies to all affected characters.

At level 2, the bard learns the "**Fascinate**" ability. The bard makes a mesmerizing performance, pulling all characters within limited range onto her square. Characters count as passing over and landing on squares as usual. Hidden characters are affected, but still do not count as passing over or landing on squares. Each character can be affected only once per turn. Fascinate is a mental effect.

At level 3, the bard learns a second Bardic Music melody, chosen from the list above.

At level 4, the bard learns the "**Suggestion**" spell, which plants an idea within the mind of a character within limited range. Until the end of the current turn, when the bard moves, the affected character also moves that same number of squares. This movement counts as passing over and landing on squares as usual for the affected character. Suggestion is a mental effect.

At level 5, the bard learns the "**Glitterdust**" spell, which affects all characters in a single square within limited range. Hidden characters are revealed—although they do not count as landing on the square in which they appear. In addition, the next time an affected character would become hidden, the effect fizzles instead. Glitterdust is an enchantment effect.

At level 6, the bard learns a third Bardic Music melody, chosen from the list above.

At level 7, the bard gains "**Bardic Knowledge**": instead of rolling, she may choose to move seven squares forward. This does not count as rolling "lucky seven" for the purposes of gaining EP. This ability is single use only.

At level 8, the bard learns the "**Mass Suggestion**" spell. It functions the same as Suggestion, but affects _all_ characters within limited range, including hidden characters. However, hidden character movement still does not count as passing over or landing on squares.

At level 9, the bard learns a fourth Bardic Music melody, chosen from the list above.

At level 10, the bard gains "**Jack-of-All-Trades**" status, learning three abilities of level 5 or less from any combination of other class lists. The bard may select rogue skills, but each skill selected is fixed at 12 ranks.

#### Bard tactics

*   Use Fascinate to pull in opponents, then Suggestion to tow them onto your property. Combo with Bardic Knowledge to control your destination square, and Dirge of Doom to maximize rental returns.
*   When landing on a red or orange property you control with an opponent in tow, use Song of Freedom to send her to Free Parking afterward, then Fascinate to drag her back onto your property for a second rental payment.
*   There are many great choices for Jack-of-All-Trades—e.g.:
    *   Song of Freedom combos well with Combat Reflexes to damage many opponents as you fly around the board.
    *   Fascinate combos well with Attack and/or Pick Pockets to pull in and then punish nearby opponents.
    *   It is especially helpful to have more tools for refining your movement such as Sneak, Run or Expeditious Retreat. Such abilities make it easier to tow opponents onto your properties effectively.
*   Dealing with Ascended clerics can be difficult since you cannot tow them. Consider focusing on enemy clerics early on in the game. You can also select Jack-of-All-Trades abilities which offer ways to punish the cleric such as Holy Smite and Far Shot, as well as defensive abilities such as Intimidate.

### 3.2 – Druid

The druid is a primal avatar of natural forces.

#### Druid abilities

At level 1, the druid begins play with a "**Primal Enchantment**" spell, which enchants her current square to have a permanent special quality. Her initial primal spell is chosen from the following list:

*   "**Entangle**" - Passing through the enchanted square costs three extra squares of movement. For example, suppose a character on Park Place rolls a seven, but the Boardwalk square is Entangled. The character movement is: 1 to Luxury Tax, 2/3/4/5 to Boardwalk, 6 to GO, and finally 7 to Mediterranean Avenue. This extra movement cost only applies when the character counts as passing over the enchanted square. The druid is not subject to this extra movement.
*   "**Obscuring Mist**" - Characters on the enchanted square are hidden. Characters enchanted by Glitterdust are unaffected, and the Glitterdust enchantment persists.
*   "**Hallow**" - Characters on the enchanted square are immune to damage.
*   "**Insect Plague**" - Characters on the enchanted square cannot use abilities.
*   "**Wall of Thorns**" - Characters who land on or pass over the enchanted square take damage. The druid is not subject to this damage.
*   "**Antimagic Field**" - The enchanted square cannot be the target of enchantments, and any active enchantments (e.g., Bless) are suppressed. Characters on the enchanted square also cannot be the target of enchantments, and their active enchantments (e.g., Shield of Faith or Hex) are suppressed. Characters on the enchanted square cannot cast spells.

Only one square on the board may be enchanted by each particular primal spell; enchanting a second square using the same spell moves the enchantment from the old square to the new one.

At level 2, the druid learns the "**Barkskin**" spell. After casting this spell, she is protected. The next time she owes money for any reason—excluding voluntary purchases such as properties or improvements thereof—she pays $25 less per level. Barkskin cannot be stacked. Barkskin is an enchantment effect.

At level 3, the druid learns the "**Wild Shape**" ability. She chooses an animal form from the following list:

*   "**Bear**" - While in bear form, the druid has ferocious strength. She possesses the "**Maul**" ability: when on the same square as an opponent, either before or after moving, the druid may deal double damage ($40 per level instead of the usual $20) to that opponent.
*   "**Eagle**" - While in eagle form, the druid flies swiftly. She rolls 3d6 for movement and drops the lowest die value.
*   "**Mouse**" - While in mouse form, the druid squeaks past danger. She rolls 3d6 for movement and drops the highest die value. Her movement does not count as passing over or landing on any squares. That is, her figurine moves, but there are no consequences to the move—she owes no rent, collects no money from passing GO, etc.
*   "**Wolf**" - While in wolf form, the druid has keen senses and agility. She possesses the "**Scent**" ability: when within limited range of another character, either before or after moving, the druid may shift her position, moving to that opponent's square. This movement counts as passing over and landing on squares as usual.

The druid can shift forms once per turn, either before or after moving. Shifting forms earns EP. While in animal form, the druid cannot cast spells—she must shift back to her normal "**Humanoid**" form in order to do so.

At level 4, the druid learns a second Primal Enchantment spell chosen from the list above.

At level 5, the druid learns the "**Tree Stride**" spell. When the druid rolls doubles, the druid can cast this spell to discard the result, instead opting to transport herself to one of her owned properties. She does not count as passing over any intervening squares, but she does count as landing on the destination square.

At level 6, the druid masters a second Wild Shape animal form, chosen from the list above.

At level 7, the druid learns a third Primal Enchantment spell chosen from the list above.

At level 8, the druid learns the "**Call Lightning**" spell. This spell calls forth up to 7 bolts of lightning, each of which strikes a different square within limited range. For each bolt, the druid chooses whether it: A) damages an opponent on the target square; B) destroys a house on the target property; or C) mortgages the target property if it is unimproved, with no corresponding loan from the bank. If none of these three conditions is applicable to a given square, that bolt has no effect.

At level 9, the druid masters a third Wild Shape animal form, chosen from the list above.

At level 10, the druid learns the "**Creeping Doom**" spell. The druid's current square, and any other properties of that same set, suffer from a terrifying insect infestation which ravages houses, hotels and characters. Opponents present at any affected property take damage. Afterward, the property owner must make repairs, paying $40 per house and $115 per hotel on that set of properties to the bank.

#### Druid tactics

*   Use a Primal Enchantment spell after moving to protect yourself between turns. Obscuring Mist is an effective choice, as are Insect Plague and Hallow.
*   Keep Barkskin active to protect yourself.
*   Once you have Wild Shape, shift form every turn if possible, to gain EP more quickly.
*   Learn Eagle form as soon as possible to move around the board faster and pass GO more quickly.
*   Use Entangle on your best property to maximize the chance of opponents landing there.
*   Use Wall of Thorns when opponents are close behind you.
*   When a nearby opponent is on a property you wish to enchant with a Primal Enchantment, switch to Wolf form and use Scent. When possible, try to enchant dangerous enemy properties before they become fully developed.
*   Antimagic Field is useful for countering enemy enchantments: e.g., when on the same square as a Wizard with Mage Armor, cast Antimagic Field, then shift to Bear form and Maul her. Or use it to suppress a cleric's Curse on your improved property.

### 3.3 – Warlock

The warlock draws power from a sinister pact with powerful entities.

#### Warlock abilities

Every warlock chooses a pact: Infernal, Fey or Dark. This choice impacts her abilities as she progresses.

At level 1, the warlock learns the "**Hex**" ability. Once per turn, either before or after moving, the warlock can place a curse on an opponent within limited range. The next time that opponent collects money from any source, the money is instead deposited into the central pot. Once money has been redirected in this way, the character is no longer considered cursed. Hex is an enchantment effect.

At level 2, the warlock learns the "**Eldritch Blast**" ability. Once per turn, either before or after moving, the warlock can shoot a blast of force at a cursed opponent within limited range. The opponent takes damage.

At level 3, the warlock develops supernatural defenses. She learns a spell according to her chosen pact:

*   [Infernal] "**Hellish Rebuke**" - In response to taking damage, the warlock can cast this spell to damage the attacker in return.
*   [Fey] "**Misty Escape**" - In response to taking damage, the warlock can cast this spell to teleport herself up to 5 squares forward or backward, and become hidden until her next turn. The warlock does not count as passing over the intervening squares, nor landing on her destination.
*   [Dark] "**Dark Delirium**" - In response to taking damage, the warlock can cast this spell to send the attacker to an illusory nightmare realm. The attacker's turn immediately ends, with no opportunity to use abilities, or roll again in the case of doubles.

At level 4, the warlock's Eldritch Blast grows stronger. Choose one of the following enhancements:

*   "**Agonizing Blast**" - The blast does 50% more damage—i.e., $30 per level instead of the normal $20.
*   "**Eldritch Spear**" - The blast's range extends to line of sight.
*   "**Repelling Blast**" - In addition to damaging the opponent, the blast also pushes her up to 2 squares away. This movement counts as passing over and landing on squares as usual.
*   "**Vampiric Blast**" - The damage is paid to the warlock instead of to the bank.

At level 5, the warlock develops supernatural fortitude. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP. She gains a trait according to her chosen pact:

*   [Infernal] "**Fiendish Resilience**" - Any time she owes a fee (Luxury Tax, Income Tax, Community Chest, Chance or jail), she pays only half the cost, rounded up.
*   [Fey] "**Beguiling Defenses**" - Any time the warlock is targeted by an enchantment, the aggressor becomes cursed as described in the Hex ability above.
*   [Dark] "**Entropic Ward**" - Any time the warlock would be affected by an enchantment or take damage, roll 1d6\. On a 1, she is unaffected.

At level 6, the warlock selects a second Eldritch Blast enhancement from the above list.

At level 7, the warlock learns the "**Dark One's Own Luck**" ability. Before rolling 2d6 for movement, she may invoke this ability to roll 3d6 and choose which two dice to keep after seeing the results. This is a single use ability.

At level 8, the warlock selects a third Eldritch Blast enhancement from the above list.

At level 9, the warlock is granted a "**Book of Shadows**" containing forbidden secrets. She learns three spells of level 4 or less from any combination of other class lists.

At level 10, the warlock learns the "**Crown of Madness**" spell, which targets an opponent within limited range. The warlock forces the opponent to immediately use an ability of the warlock's choice, as the warlock dictates. The warlock cannot force an opponent to cast a spell with a casting cost. For example, a warlock could force a nearby wizard to cast Fireball to destroy property improvements on the wizard's current square, or force a nearby cleric to cast Holy Smite on an annoying bard. Crown of Madness is a mental effect with a $200 casting cost.

#### Warlock tactics

*   Keep all opponents cursed whenever possible, so that you can blast them for EP.
*   Use Repelling Blast to force opponents to pay rent on your properties.
*   For maximum brutality, select the Fiendish pact and choose Agonizing Blast early. This build damages opponents more often and more painfully.
*   For a more tactical warlock, select the Fey pact and choose Repelling Blast early. This build gives you control over your positioning, as well as that of your opponents.
*   To focus on defense, select the Dark pact and choose Vampiric Blast early. This build shuts down your opponents, gives you a chance to ignore harmful effects, and brings in more cash.

## 4 – Advanced and alternative rules

### Politics

Like normal Monopoly, Dungeonopoly can become very political. For example, a four player game can easily degenerate into a two on two game. When that happens, it not always clear what's allowed and what's not. Can you choose to waive the rent on one of your properties? What about reduce it? One way to cut down on the politics is to institute strict rules, so that rent must always be paid, and money and property cannot be given or traded to other players except at listed value. However, this strictness can cause problems as well, since part of the value of a trade is not represented in its listed price; for example, obtaining the third property in a set to form a monopoly is clearly more valuable than obtaining the same property without possessing the other two matching ones.

### Team rules

*   Multiple players work together to bankrupt the other teams
*   Team members share one pool of cash on hand, and one collection of properties
*   Combine class skills to reach new heights of brokenness!
*   Play a quicker or blitz team game using the rules below

### Quicker game

*   5 EP per level
*   Double all fees: damage, Community Chest/Chance, jail, etc.
*   Cut all gains in half: Pick Pockets, Community Chest/Chance, etc.

### Blitz game

*   Before the game starts, players take turns choosing one property at a time until all are taken
*   Characters begin play at level 10

### Gestalt classes

*   Each player chooses two classes, gaining the abilities of both, and levels in both simultaneously
