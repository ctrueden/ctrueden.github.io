Dungeonopoly utilizes all the normal Monopoly rules, with additional rules described below. Before you begin, be certain you are familiar with the regular Monopoly rules. Familiarity with the D&D 3rd edition rule set is also useful, but not required.

The following additional basic rules are in effect when playing Dungeonopoly:

1.  When landing on GO, collect $400 instead of the normal $200—even if due to the "Advance to GO" card.

2.  When paying a fee such as a Chance or Community Chest penalty, Income Tax, Luxury Tax, or the $50 jail fee, place the money in the "central pot" in the center of the board. Anyone landing on "Free Parking" collects this money.

3.  Players may purchase houses and hotels only during their own turns. They may sell houses and hotels, and mortgage property, only during their own turns, or when forced to raise additional cash. These limits avoid many problems, exploits and ambiguities surrounding off-turn transactions.

4.  Each player needs a d20 and a pewter figurine of her character to play.

5.  Each player chooses a character class from those described below. Multiclassing is not allowed.

6.  Characters begin play as level 1 of their chosen class, and character levels range from 1 through 10.

7.  For every 10 EP gained, a new level is achieved.

8.  Characters gain 1 EP for each of the following:
    *   Purchasing property from the bank
    *   Paying rent on an opponent's property
    *   Successfully using a class ability
    *   Rolling doubles
    *   Rolling 7 ("lucky seven")
    *   Collecting money from passing, or landing on, GO

9.  When one character damages another, the defender pays the bank $20 times the level of the attacker. If the defender has insufficient cash on hand, she must pursue all the usual channels to pay her debt. If she still cannot pay, she is bankrupt.

10. There are a few technical terms which help to describe abilities succinctly:
    *   "_Single use only_" - These abilities may only be used once each time around the board. Passing GO clears these abilities for another use.
    *   "_Limited range_" - These abilities can target a nearby character on the same square or up to some number of squares away in either direction. The level of the user determines the maximum distance as follows: 1-2 = 1 square, 3-4 = 2 squares, 5-6 = 3 squares, 7-8 = 4 squares, 9-10 = 5 squares.
    *   "_Line of sight_" - These abilities can target a character on the same edge of the board. If the user is on a corner square, she counts as on both adjoining edges.
    *   "_Enchantment effect_" - These abilities leave a lasting impression which can be targeted by certain other abilities such as Counterspell.
    *   "_Mental effect_" - These abilities target a character's mind. Certain characters (e.g., Ascended clerics) are immune to such effects.
    *   "_Hidden_" - A hidden character is immune to spells and abilities that target her. Thus, she cannot be attacked, nor can she be affected by Magic Missile, Charm Person, Telekinesis or Holy Smite, although Fireball would still damage her since it does not target her specifically.

11. Spellcasting has a few special rules:
    *   Unless otherwise noted, spells are single use only. Spells without this limitation are called _cantrips_.
    *   Unless otherwise noted, spells can be cast either before or after moving, but only one spell can be cast per turn, even if doubles are rolled. If casting before moving, the spell must be cast before rolling dice for movement. Casting between movement rolls (if doubles are rolled) is allowed, but casting on the way to jail—e.g., after rolling doubles for the third time—is not.
    *   Some spells have specific conditions which allow them to be cast during another character's turn; such castings do not count toward the one spell per turn limit.

12. "In jail" is a special square. _**A character in jail does not collect rent on her properties**_. Two people in jail do not count as being on the same square, or even on the same edge of the board—each character is in an isolated cell. Spellcasting in jail is not allowed, nor is casting a spell at someone who is in jail—the cells have antimagic fields. Thus, a fighter cannot use Far Shot on anyone from within the jail, nor can she use it to hit someone who is in jail. Someone in jail is also safe from the fighter's Combat Reflexes ability, as well as from spells such as Telekinesis and Holy Smite.
