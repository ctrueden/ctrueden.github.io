The rogue is wily and crafty, stealing what she needs to survive.

#### Rogue abilities

Rogues begin play with 30 points to distribute throughout their skills. Each time they gain a level, 5 more points become available for distribution. Because thievery always involves a degree of risk, no skill may have more than 15 ranks.

To use a skill, the rogue must pass a skill check by rolling less than or equal to her ranks in that skill on a d20\. The rogue only receives EP for using the skill if she is successful.

The rogue's skills are:

*   "**Open Locks**" is the skill for escaping jail. When in jail, the rogue can use this skill to leave without paying the usual $50\. She can attempt to escape on the same turn she is imprisoned, as well as at the beginning of any subsequent turn. She can also use this skill to release other characters from jail when she is on the Just Visiting square. A separate skill check is required for each character to be released. Only one attempt can be made per character each turn.

*   "**Pick Pockets**" is the skill for stealing money from other characters. Whenever the rogue is on the same square as another character, she can use this skill to attempt to pick the pockets of that character. If successful, she takes $20 per level from the opponent's cash on hand. If the opponent has insufficient cash on hand, the rogue simply takes what she can get. If she fails the skill roll, the rogue goes to jail. The rogue can also use this skill on an opponent while sneaking past—see the Sneak skill below. Only one attempt can be made per character each turn.

*   "**Rob Bank**" is the skill for stealing money from the bank. When the rogue passes GO, she can attempt to obtain additional money using this skill. If successful, she takes an extra $50 per level. When landing on GO, success yields an extra $100 per level. If she fails, however, she forfeits her entire GO bonus and goes to jail.

*   "**Sneak**" is the skill for moving stealthily. Instead of rolling movement normally, the rogue can opt to sneak with a successful skill check. She rolls only 1d6 for movement. During that move, she does not count as passing over or landing on any squares—that is, her figurine moves, but there are no consequences to the move—she owes no rent, collects no money from passing GO, etc.

    While sneaking past an opponent, she may choose to **Backstab** that opponent, damaging her and earning an additional EP. She may also pick pockets if desired, although she faces the usual penalties for failure—see the Pick Pockets skill above.

    After sneaking, a rogue is considered hidden until her next turn.

    Lastly, after moving, she may choose not to hide, so that she still counts as having landed on the current property. If the rogue "comes out of sneak" in this fashion, she must face all normal consequences of landing on the current property, and she is no longer hidden until her next turn.

*   "**Steal**" is the skill for robbing property of valuables. When on a property with at least one house, the rogue may use this skill to loot the place, stealing 5% of the property's rent per level, rounded down. The rogue receives this money from the property owner, who must take all the usual actions to generate enough money, or else she goes bankrupt. If the rogue fails her skill roll, she must pay rent on the property normally if she has not done so already, then go to jail.

#### Rogue tactics

*   Max out Rob Bank early in the game. Traverse the board as quickly as possible to pass GO often, for more chances to line your pockets and gain EP.
*   Do not develop Steal until later in the game, when improved properties become more common.
*   Do not overuse Sneak, especially early in the game when there are few harmful squares. It will slow your movement to a crawl and stunt your EP growth. Instead, use Sneak later in the game to land on opponents' improved properties without paying rent, then Steal from them.
*   Take advantage of several opponents in a cluster within six squares ahead of you. Sneak, then Backstab and Pick Pockets each one as you pass. Since you can Backstab and Pick Pockets in either order, consider the pros and cons of each. Pick Pockets followed by Backstab might run the opponent out of cash and force her to sell houses or mortgage property, but runs the risk of going to jail before earning the Backstab EP. The other order earns a safe EP and does guaranteed damage, but may result in less money from Pick Pockets if the opponent is low on cash.
*   When on Just Visiting, release characters in jail using Open Locks, then pick their pockets.
*   Don't forget to "come out of sneak" when landing on desirable properties such as Free Parking and GO.
*   A failed Pick Pockets or Steal attempt sends you to jail, safe from opponents' abilities and properties. A subsequent successful Open Locks earns EP.
