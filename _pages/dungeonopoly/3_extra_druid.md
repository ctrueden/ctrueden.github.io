The druid is a primal avatar of natural forces.

#### Druid abilities

At level 1, the druid begins play with a "**Primal Enchantment**" spell, which enchants her current square to have a permanent special quality. Her initial primal spell is chosen from the following list:

*   "**Entangle**" - Passing through the enchanted square costs two extra squares of movement. For example, suppose a character on Park Place rolls a six, but the Boardwalk square is Entangled. The character movement is: 1 to Luxury Tax, 2/3/4 to Boardwalk, 5 to GO, and finally 6 to Mediterranean Avenue. This extra movement cost only applies when the character counts as passing over the enchanted square. The druid is not subject to this extra movement.
*   "**Obscuring Mist**" - Characters on the enchanted square are hidden. Characters enchanted by Glitterdust are unaffected, and the Glitterdust enchantment persists.
*   "**Hallow**" - Characters on the enchanted square are immune to damage.
*   "**Insect Plague**" - Characters on the enchanted square cannot use abilities.
*   "**Wall of Thorns**" - Characters passing over the enchanted square must choose: stop on the square, or take damage. The druid is not subject to this damage.
*   "**Antimagic Field**" - The enchanted square cannot be the target of enchantments, and any active enchantments (e.g., Bless) are suppressed. Characters on the enchanted square also cannot be the target of enchantments, and their active enchantments (e.g., Shield of Faith or Hex) are suppressed. Characters on the enchanted square cannot cast spells.

Only one square on the board may be enchanted by each particular primal spell; enchanting a second square using the same spell moves the enchantment from the old square to the new one.

At level 2, the druid learns the "**Barkskin**" spell. After casting this spell, she is protected. The next time she owes money for any reason—excluding voluntary purchases such as properties or improvements thereof—she pays $25 less per level, to a minimum of $1. Barkskin cannot be stacked. Barkskin is an enchantment effect.

At level 3, the druid learns the "**Wild Shape**" ability. She chooses an animal form from the following list:

*   "**Bear**" - While in bear form, the druid has ferocious strength. She possesses the "**Maul**" ability: when on the same square as an opponent, either before or after moving, the druid may deal double damage ($40 per level instead of the usual $20) to that opponent.
*   "**Eagle**" - While in eagle form, the druid flies swiftly. She rolls 3d6 for movement and drops the lowest die value.
*   "**Wolf**" - While in wolf form, the druid has keen senses and agility. She possesses the "**Scent**" ability: when within limited range of another character, either before or after moving, the druid may shift her position, moving to that opponent's square. This movement counts as passing over and landing on squares as usual.

The druid can shift forms once per turn, either before or after moving. Shifting forms does not earn EP. While in animal form, the druid cannot cast spells—she must shift back to her normal "**Humanoid**" form in order to do so.

At level 4, the druid learns a second Primal Enchantment spell chosen from the list above.

At level 5, the druid learns the "**Tree Stride**" spell. When the druid rolls doubles, the druid can cast this spell to discard the result, instead opting to transport herself to one of her owned properties. She does not count as passing over any intervening squares, but she does count as landing on the destination square. She does not gain EP from rolling doubles (since she discarded the roll), nor does she roll again afterward.

At level 6, the druid masters a second Wild Shape animal form, chosen from the list above.

At level 7, the druid learns a third Primal Enchantment spell chosen from the list above.

At level 8, the druid learns the "**Call Lightning**" spell. This spell calls forth up to 7 bolts of lightning, each of which strikes a different square within limited range. For each bolt, the druid chooses whether it: A) damages an opponent on the target square; B) destroys a house on the target property; or C) mortgages the target property if it is unimproved, with no corresponding loan from the bank. If none of these three conditions is applicable to a given square, that bolt has no effect.

At level 9, the druid masters a third Wild Shape animal form, chosen from the list above.

At level 10, the druid learns the "**Creeping Doom**" spell. The druid's current square, and any other properties of that same set, suffer from a terrifying insect infestation which ravages houses, hotels and characters. Opponents present at any affected property take damage. Afterward, the property owner must make repairs, paying $40 per house and $115 per hotel on that set of properties to the bank.

#### Druid tactics

*   Use a Primal Enchantment spell after moving to protect yourself between turns. Obscuring Mist is an effective choice, as are Insect Plague and Hallow.
*   Keep Barkskin active to protect yourself.
*   Learn Eagle form as soon as possible to move around the board faster and pass GO more quickly.
*   Use Entangle on your best property to maximize the chance of opponents landing there.
*   When a nearby opponent is on a property you wish to enchant with a Primal Enchantment, switch to Wolf form and use Scent. When possible, try to enchant dangerous enemy properties before they become fully developed.
*   Antimagic Field is useful for countering enemy enchantments: e.g., when on the same square as a Wizard with Mage Armor, cast Antimagic Field, then shift to Bear form and Maul her. Or use it to suppress a cleric's Curse on your improved property.
