### Politics

Like normal Monopoly, Dungeonopoly can become very political. For example, a four player game can easily degenerate into a two on two game. When that happens, it not always clear what's allowed and what's not. Can you choose to waive the rent on one of your properties? What about reduce it? One way to cut down on the politics is to institute strict rules, so that rent must always be paid, and money and property cannot be given or traded to other players except at listed value. However, this strictness can cause problems as well, since part of the value of a trade is not represented in its listed price; for example, obtaining the third property in a set to form a monopoly is clearly more valuable than obtaining the same property without possessing the other two matching ones.

### Team rules

*   Multiple players work together to bankrupt the other teams
*   Team members share one pool of cash on hand, and one collection of properties
*   Combine class skills to reach new heights of brokenness!
*   Play a quicker or blitz team game using the rules below

### Quicker game

*   Start with the Monopoly fast game rules:
    *   Shuffle properties and deal three to each player to start
    *   Spend only one turn max in jail rather than three
    *   Houses cap out at three rather than four
*   5 EP per level

### Blitz game

*   Before the game starts, players take turns choosing one property at a time until all are taken
*   Characters begin play at level 10

### Gestalt classes

*   Each player chooses two classes, gaining the abilities of both, and levels in both simultaneously
