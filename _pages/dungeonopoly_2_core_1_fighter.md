Fighters excel at dealing damage, debilitating their opponents' properties and strengthening their own.

#### Fighter abilities

At level 1, the fighter begins with the "**Attack**" ability. When on the same square as an opponent, either before or after moving, the fighter may damage that opponent.

At level 2, the fighter gains the "**Run**" ability. Before her first movement roll of the turn, the fighter may choose to run, granting her an extra 1d6 of movement. For the purposes of determining doubles, roll the usual 2d6 first, then the extra 1d6—or use color-coded dice. If the fighter chooses to run, she cannot use any other class abilities during that turn.

At level 3, the fighter gains the "**Far Shot**" ability. Once per turn, either before or after moving, she can invoke this ability to damage an opponent at least one square away within line of sight. The shot can miss, however—chance of success is 10% per level. If the shot misses, no EP is earned for its use.

At level 4, the fighter gains the "**Intimidate**" ability. Whenever she owes rent, she may attempt to intimidate the landlord so that she does not have to pay. To do so, she must roll her level or less on a d20\. If she fails, she does not earn EP for using the ability and she must pay rent normally.

At level 5, the fighter can use "**Combat Reflexes**" to attack (and therefore damage) an opponent as she passes that opponent while moving on her turn. That is, she no longer needs to land on the same square as her opponent to attack.

At level 6, the fighter can "**Raze**" enemy buildings. Whenever she lands on an opponent's property with one or more houses, she automatically destroys one of the houses. Hotels are immune to razing.

At level 7, the fighter can "**Fortify**" her own property. Whenever she lands on her own property, she can add a house, to a maximum of four. Four houses cannot be fortified into a hotel, and the fighter cannot purchase a property and fortify it on the same turn—that is, it must be her when she lands on it. Mortgaged properties cannot be fortified. The fighter need not have a monopoly to fortify a given property.

At level 8, the fighter can "**Conquer**" opponents' property. Whenever she lands on an opponent's mortgaged property, she may choose to gain control of it—i.e., transfer the title to her. As usual when a mortgaged property changes hands, she must either pay to unmortgage the property on the spot (110% of the mortgage value) or pay a 10% transfer fee and leave the property mortgaged.

At level 9, the fighter gains "**Veteran**" status. When damaged, she pays half the usual amount. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 10, the fighter gains the "**Abundant Step**" ability. Instead of rolling for movement, she may choose to move forward one to four squares. This ability is single use only. The fighter does not count as passing over any squares that get crossed, although she does count as having landed on the destination square. The fighter cannot use "Combat Reflexes" while using Abundant Step, nor can she use "Far Shot" unless it is following a normal move that same turn (which can only happen when doubles are rolled).

#### Fighter tactics

*   Use Run often as soon as you learn it. You'll earn EP quickly, and pass GO often.
*   Don't forget about Intimidate! Having rent fees waived often is extremely valuable.
*   Use both Combat Reflexes and Far Shot to damage someone with Mage Armor or Shield of Faith active.
*   Once you learn Abundant Step, use it in combination with the tactical abilities Raze, Fortify and Conquer.
