Wizards have a variety of useful spells in their arsenal.

#### Wizard abilities

Wizards begin play with one spell, and obtain another spell each time they gain a level.

At level 1, the wizard begins with "**Magic Missile**." This spell damages an opponent within limited range.

At level 2, the wizard learns "**Expeditious Retreat**." Before a movement roll, she may cast this spell to double the results of the next movement roll this turn.

At level 3, the wizard learns "**Mage Armor**." After casting this spell she is protected, and does not take damage the next time she normally would. Mage Armor cannot be stacked—that is, casting it twice does not protect from the next two attacks. Mage Armor is an enchantment effect.

At level 4, the wizard learns "**Slow**." This spell slows a character within limited range. The next time that character rolls for movement, she rolls only 1d6 instead of 2d6\. A slowed fighter who runs rolls only 2d6 instead of 3d6, and since one of these dice is an "extra" die, the fighter cannot roll doubles or lucky seven. A slowed rogue who sneaks moves only half as far—1 square on a roll of 1 or 2, 2 squares on a roll of 3 or 4, or 3 squares on a roll of 5 or 6\. Slow is an enchantment effect.

At level 5, the wizard learns "**Invisibility**." Before a movement roll, she may cast this spell to become unseen. During that turn's movement, she does not count as passing over or landing on any squares—his figurine moves, but there are no consequences to the move: she owes no rent, collects no money from passing GO, etc. Invisibility is an enchantment effect.

Until her next turn, the wizard is considered hidden.

At level 6, the wizard learns "**Charm Person**." This spell charms an opponent within limited range. The next time the wizard owes rent money to that opponent, the opponent must waive the fee. Charm Person is a mental enchantment effect.

At level 7, the wizard learns "**Counterspell**." This spell dispels an enchantment within limited range. Thus, the wizard could use it to dispel Bless or Curse from the current property, Charm Person from herself, Mage Armor or Shield of Faith from an opponent on the same square, etc.

Alternately, she can cast Counterspell to cancel out a spell being cast by another character anywhere on the board. Since casting in this manner happens during a different character's turn, it does not count toward the one spell per turn limit.

Note that Counterspell targets spells and enchantments, not the character casting them—hence, a cleric with Shield of Faith active can still have her spells countered, and a cleric protected by Sanctuary can have the Sanctuary dispelled.

At level 8, the wizard learns "**Fireball**." When cast, all houses and hotels on the current square are destroyed, unless the property is blessed. In addition, all opponents on that square take damage. If rent is owed, payment must be made before the buildings are destroyed.

At level 9, the wizard learns "**Telekinesis**." Any character on the board may be targeted, including the wizard herself. The targeted character moves between one and five squares, either forward or backward. The character does count as passing over any squares that get crossed—so passing GO and collecting $200 due to Telekinesis is possible. However, the character does not count as having landed on the final square. Thus, using Telekinesis to push an opponent three spaces back onto a property with a hotel does not cause that opponent to owe rent for that property. In the case of landing on GO with telekinesis, collect $200 for "passing" GO but not the extra $200 for landing on it.

At level 10, the wizard learns "**Wish**." She can cast it to duplicate the effects of any other spell of any class. Alternatively, when the current square is already owned, the wizard may use Wish to place a hotel on the property, even if it is not part of a monopoly. Wish has a $500 casting cost.

#### Wizard tactics

*   Use Expeditious Retreat often as soon as you learn it. You'll pass GO more quickly.
*   To protect yourself against enemies, especially the brutal fighter, have Mage Armor active whenever possible. If an opponent is continually hassling you, control your movement with Expeditious Retreat or Slow to escape her, or use Invisibility to hide from her.
*   Use Slow on an opponent nearing your improved properties, to increase her chances of landing there. Or, use it on yourself when nearing a desirable square such as Free Parking, GO or Boardwalk.
*   Control your movement through enemy properties with Expeditious Retreat, Slow and Telekinesis.
*   Use Invisibility to avoid paying rent on particularly devastating improved properties.
*   Keep all your opponents charmed whenever possible.
*   Use Counterspell, Fireball and Wish to make deals with opponents. Threaten to destroy all their houses, offer to dispel an enemy Curse, or even place a hotel on their property, in exchange for money, property or services.
*   Use Telekinesis to maneuver an opponent to a location with the greatest chance of landing on your improved properties—seven squares away is statistically most likely.
*   Study the cleric spells as well, since Wish can duplicate any cleric spell.
