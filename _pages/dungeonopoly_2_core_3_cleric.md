The cleric is chosen by the gods, granted holy powers and blessings.

#### Cleric abilities

Clerics begin play with one spell, and obtain other spells and powers as they advance in level.

At level 1, the cleric begins play with the "**Bless**" spell. When cast, the current property becomes blessed, yielding an additional 5% rent per level of the cleric, rounded down. Hence, a property normally yielding $650 in rent would bring in $747 if blessed by a level 3 cleric. In addition, a blessed property is immune to effects that destroy buildings, such as the wizard's "Fireball" and the fighter's "Raze." If cast on a cursed land, Bless simply dispels the curse. Bless is an enchantment effect and has a $50 casting cost.

Alternately, the cleric can invert the spell and cast it as a "**Curse**." When cast, the current property becomes cursed, yielding 5% less rent per level of the cleric, rounded up. Hence, a property normally yielding $650 in rent would bring in $553 if cursed by a level 3 cleric. If cast on a blessed land, Curse simply dispels the blessing. Curse is an enchantment effect and has a $50 casting cost

At level 2, the cleric learns the "**Shield of Faith**" spell. After casting this spell, she is protected. The next time someone either damages her or casts a spell at her (e.g., Magic Missile, Charm Person or Telekinesis) she is unaffected. Shield of Faith cannot be stacked—that is, casting it twice does not protect from the next two attacks or spells. Shield of Faith is an enchantment effect.

At level 3, the cleric learns the "**Sanctuary**" spell. After casting the spell, the cleric is invulnerable until her next turn. She cannot be targeted by any class abilities, nor can she take damage. If cast before moving, the cleric forfeits her movement roll. Sanctuary is an enchantment effect.

At level 4, the cleric gains a new power, "**Divine Favor**." She no longer needs to pay most fees. She can ignore Luxury Tax and Income Tax payments, as well as choose whether to accept the consequences of any Community Chest and Chance cards she draws. However, she still pays the $50 jail fee to get out of jail. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 5, the cleric learns the "**Holy Smite**" spell. When cast, it damages an opponent, regardless of her position on the board—although it cannot be used to damage someone in jail.

At level 6, the cleric learns the "**Divine Intervention**" spell. Any time dice are rolled, she can cast this spell to discard the result and require a reroll. If she casts this spell to reroll a roll during her own turn, it counts toward the one spell per turn limit.

At level 7, the cleric gains a new power, "**Divine Power**." Whenever she passes a Chance or Community Chest square, she draws the card. Divine Favor applies as usual for choosing whether to accept each card. If the card is a movement card (e.g., "Advance to GO") and the cleric accepts it, movement occurs from the associated Chance or Community Chest square, and the remainder of the cleric's movement roll is discarded.

In addition, whenever she passes the Free Parking square, she collects the money from the central pot—she no longer needs to land on the square.

This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 8, the cleric learns the "**Glyph of Warding**" spell. Casting this spell leaves behind a glyph on the current property. The next character to pass over the property with the glyph stops on that square, forfeiting any remaining movement—treat it as though the character landed on that square. In addition, the affected character takes damage. In the case of a character being moved with Telekinesis over a glyph, the character still does not count as landing on the square. Glyph of Warding is an enchantment effect and has a $150 casting cost.

At level 9, the cleric gains "**Ascended**" status. She is immune to mental effects (e.g., Charm Person), as well as any effect that would send her to jail. In the case of three consecutive doubles rolls, the cleric moves the result of the third roll but does not roll a fourth time. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 10, the cleric learns the "**Wrath of God**" spell. When cast, all opponents are damaged—even hidden ones. Furthermore, all opponents' properties lose one house. A property with a hotel is downgraded to four houses. Unimproved properties are unaffected. Wrath of God has a $300 casting cost.

#### Cleric tactics

*   Use Bless/Curse to make deals with opponents. Offer them the chance to get their property blessed for a fee, or threaten to curse their property if they won't meet your demands.
*   To stay protected from your enemies, especially the brutal fighter, have Shield of Faith active whenever possible. If an opponent is continually hassling you, use Sanctuary before your movement to protect yourself, and to increase the likelihood of her passing you.
*   Don't forget about Divine Favor and Divine Power. Those Community Chest and Chance bonuses really add up.
*   Use Holy Smite when an opponent is low on cash to force her to sell houses or mortgage property.
*   Use Divine Intervention to force a lucky opponent to reroll if she escapes landing on your improved properties. Or use it on yourself to avoid landing on an opponent's improved property.
*   Place Glyphs of Warding on your improved properties to increase the chances of your opponents landing there. Or offer to place a glyph on an opponent's property in exchange for a fee.
