The bard sings sweet songs, lulling her opponents into a false sense of security.

#### Bard abilities

At level 1, the bard learns the "**Fascinate**" ability. The bard makes a mesmerizing performance, pulling all characters within limited range onto her square. Characters count as passing over and landing on squares as usual. Hidden characters are affected, but still do not count as passing over or landing on squares. Each character can be affected only once per turn. Fascinate is a mental effect.

At level 2, the bard begins play the "**Bardic Music**" ability. The bard may activate this ability whenever a character—including the bard herself—owes rent with the bard present on that rental property. The bard performs a melody which alters details of the transaction. She begins play with one melody, chosen from the following list:

*   "**Inspire Courage**" - The bank pays half the rent owed on behalf of the character.
*   "**Cutting Words**" - After rent is paid, the property owner takes damage.
*   "**Song of Freedom**" - After rent is paid, the character advances to Free Parking, collecting $200 if she passes GO.
*   "**Inspire Greatness**" - After rent is paid, the character rolls 2d6 and moves forward that many squares. Characters count as passing over and landing on squares as usual.
*   "**Song of Rest**" - After rent is paid, the character's turn immediately ends, with no opportunity to use abilities, or roll again in the case of doubles. The character regains all single-use abilities.
*   "**Frightening Tune**" - After rent is paid, the character rolls 1d6 and flees backward that many squares. Characters count as passing over and landing on squares as usual.
*   "**Dirge of Doom**" - The rent owed is doubled. In the case of blessed or cursed property, adjust for the blessing/curse first, then double the result.

Only one melody may be used per activation of Bardic Music. In the case of multiple characters owing rent on a property simultaneously (e.g., due to the Mass Suggestion spell), the bard performs only a single bardic melody, which applies to all affected characters.

At level 3, the bard learns the "**Suggestion**" spell, which plants an idea within the mind of a character within limited range. Until the end of the current turn, when the bard moves, the affected character also moves that same number of squares. This movement counts as passing over and landing on squares as usual for the affected character. Suggestion is a mental effect.

At level 4, the bard learns a second Bardic Music melody, chosen from the list above.

At level 5, the bard learns the "**Glitterdust**" spell, which affects all characters in a single square within limited range. Hidden characters are revealed—although they do not count as landing on the square in which they appear. In addition, the next time an affected character would become hidden, the effect fizzles instead. Glitterdust is an enchantment effect.

At level 6, the bard learns a third Bardic Music melody, chosen from the list above.

At level 7, the bard gains "**Bardic Knowledge**": instead of rolling, she may choose to move seven squares forward. This does not count as rolling "lucky seven" for the purposes of gaining EP. This ability is single use only.

At level 8, the bard learns a fourth Bardic Music melody, chosen from the list above.

At level 9, the bard learns the "**Mass Suggestion**" spell. It functions the same as Suggestion, but affects _all_ characters within limited range, including hidden characters. However, hidden character movement still does not count as passing over or landing on squares.

At level 10, the bard gains "**Jack-of-All-Trades**" status, learning three abilities of level 5 or less from any combination of other class lists. The bard may select rogue skills, but each skill selected is fixed at 12 ranks.

#### Bard tactics

*   Use Fascinate to pull in opponents, then Suggestion to tow them onto your property. Combo with Bardic Knowledge to control your destination square, and Dirge of Doom to maximize rental returns.
*   When landing on a red or orange property you control with an opponent in tow, use Song of Freedom to send her to Free Parking afterward, then Fascinate to drag her back onto your property for a second rental payment.
*   There are many great choices for Jack-of-All-Trades—e.g.:
    *   Song of Freedom combos well with Combat Reflexes to damage many opponents as you fly around the board.
    *   Fascinate combos well with Attack and/or Pick Pockets to pull in and then punish nearby opponents.
    *   It is especially helpful to have more tools for refining your movement such as Sneak or Expeditious Retreat. Such abilities make it easier to tow opponents onto your properties effectively.
*   Dealing with Ascended clerics can be difficult since you cannot tow them. Consider focusing on enemy clerics early on in the game. You can also select Jack-of-All-Trades abilities which offer ways to punish the cleric such as Holy Smite and Far Shot, as well as defensive abilities such as Intimidate.
