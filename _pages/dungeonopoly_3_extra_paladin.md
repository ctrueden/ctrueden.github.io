The paladin is a holy knight who focuses on chivalry and defense.

#### Paladin abilities

At level 1, the paladin learns the "**Counter**" ability. When the paladin takes damage from an opponent within reach, the paladin may choose to counter, damaging that opponent in response. An opponent is _within reach_ when she is on the same square as the paladin, or on an adjacent square.

At level 2, the paladin learns the "**Challenge**" ability. The paladin taunts an opponent within line of sight into participating in a duel. The paladin and the opponent each ante one of their respective unimproved properties; if the opponent has no such property to ante, the ability is wasted and the paladin does not earn EP. The two properties are then immediately auctioned as a pair, with bidding only possible between the paladin and that opponent. As usual for auctions, only cash on hand may be used for bidding. For property which is mortgaged, the normal transfer fee of 10% applies as usual; the winner may also opt to pay back the mortgage as part of the transaction if desired. Winning the auction counts as purchasing property for the purpose of gaining EP.

At level 3, the paladin befriends a "**Celestial Mount**." This noble steed offers the paladin swift travel around the board. Once per turn, the paladin may _summon + mount_ or _dismount + dismiss_ the horse; these actions earn EP. While mounted, each time the paladin rolls for movement, the die type used increases: the first move is at a _trot_ and rolls 2d8; the second move is at a _canter_ and rolls 2d10; and third and later moves are at a _gallop_ and roll 2d12. Dismounting resets the progression back to 2d6 as usual.

At level 4, the paladin masters a "**Fighting Stance**." The paladin may enter a stance only after moving, and entering one ends the paladin's turn. The stance's effects last until the start of the paladin's next turn. Only one stance may be active at a time. Stances cannot be used while mounted. Entering a stance earns EP.

She chooses one of the following stances:

* "**Thicket of Blades**" - The paladin enters an offensive stance. An opponent who passes through (i.e., moves into, within or out of) any square within the paladin's reach provokes an attack of opportunity which damages the opponent. An opponent passing though multiple such squares takes damage only once.

* "**Bulwark of Defense**" - The paladin enters a defensive stance. While in defensive stance, the paladin cannot be moved by any ability (e.g., Telekinesis or Fascinate). Furthermore, each square within the paladin's reach costs an extra square of movement for opponents to pass through. For example, suppose the paladin is on Boardwalk in defensive stance, and then an opponent on Park Place rolls a seven. The opponent's movement is: 1/2 to Luxury Tax, 3/4 to Boardwalk, 5/6 to GO, and finally 7 to Mediterranean Avenue. This extra movement cost only applies when the movement counts as passing over a defended square. 

At level 5, the paladin learns the "**Knight's Move**" ability. Either before or after moving, the paladin maneuvers a character—either herself or an opponent within line of sight—three squares either forward or backward. This movement does not count as passing over the intervening squares, but does count as landing on the destination square. This ability is single use only.

At level 6, the paladin gains a new power, "**Divine Grace**." When the paladin rolls doubles, she is surrounded by an aura of protection. Until the end of her current turn, she is invulnerable, ignoring all damage, fees and rental payments.

At level 7, the paladin gains a new power, "**Holy Nimbus.**" Any time an opponent, even a hidden one, starts her turn within the paladin's reach, that opponent takes damage.

At level 8, the paladin masters a second stance from those listed above. Only one stance may be active at a time.

At level 9, the paladin gains a new power, "**Heart of the Titan**." She sets aside $500 from the bank into an isolated reservoir. This money forms a "buffer" against damage which is spent before the paladin's own funds whenever she takes damage. The fund is replenished whenever the paladin passes GO. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP.

At level 10, the paladin gains a new power, "**Holy Sword**." The paladin's reach increases to two squares away.

#### Paladin tactics

* Be careful with Challenge. When used cautiously and prudently, it can net you substantial rewards, but when used recklessly, it will drain your reserves and reward your opponents.
* Once you have a horse, use it to gallop around the board and gain money quickly. Or to hasten EP gains, mount or dismount every turn.
* Use Bulwark of Defense to avoid being moved over or into hostile territory, especially later in the game when opponents have such abilities and there are more hazards.
* End your turn with Bulwark of Defense when on or near your own improved properties, to encourage opponents to pay rent there. Otherwise, consider using Thicket of Blades for more reliable damage as opponents pass.
* After rolling doubles and moving, you can enter a stance to end your turn instead of rolling again. Use this situationally to increase the frequency of opponents passing through the squares you threaten.
* Knight's Move is a floor wax _and_ a dessert topping. Use it to avoid hazardous squares, land on desirable property, kick opponents onto hazardous squares, adjust distance to maximize probabilities, quickly pass GO again after landing on or just past GO... the world is your Monopoly board.
