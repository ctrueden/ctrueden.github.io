The psion manipulates her enemies with barrages of mental energy.

#### Psion abilities

Psions manifest mental powers by spending power points (PP). A psion has a number of PP equal to her level. Passing GO refills the psion's available PP.

As with spells, powers may be manifested either before or after moving, and only one power can be manifested per turn, even if doubles are rolled. Unlike spells, however, each power can be used more than once each time around the board, provided the psion has sufficient PP to do so.

Some powers are manifested defensively, in response to some triggering event. These powers are immediate responses which do not count toward the one power per turn limit.

For any psionic power affecting targets within limited range, the psion may choose to augment the reach of the power: for each additional PP spent in this manner, that manifestation affects targets one square further away.

At level 1, the psion begins play with the "**Mind Thrust**" power. The psion delivers an assault on the thought pathways of an opponent within limited range. The opponent suffers mental damage according to the following table:

| PP spent | Amount |
|:--------:|:------:|
|        1 |    $10 |
|        2 |    $30 |
|        3 |    $60 |
|        4 |   $100 |
|        5 |   $150 |
|        6 |   $210 |
|        7 |   $280 |
|        8 |   $360 |
|        9 |   $450 |
|       10 |   $550 |

At level 2, the psion learns the "**Empty Mind**" power. The psion floats in an expanse of vacuous conception, emptying her mind of all transitory and distracting thoughts. In response to owing money, the amount owed is reduced according to the table given above. Empty Mind is a defensive power.

At level 3, the psion learns the "**Ego Whip**" power. The psion's rapid mental lashings assault the ego of a character within limited range. The character is dazed: the next time she rolls for movement, the movement is forfeit. She moves no squares, and counts as landing on her current square again. Ego Whip is a mental enchantment effect, which costs 2 PP to manifest.

At level 4, the psion learns the "**Modify Memory**" power. The psion reaches into the mind of an opponent within limited range, manipulating her memories. Control of the opponent's least expensive property, including any improvements, transfers to the psion.

Each time someone owes rent on the property, the original owner rolls a d20: if she rolls her level or less, she remembers the truth, breaking the enchantment and regaining control of the property, including for the triggering transaction.

Modify Memory cannot be stacked—that is, casting it twice on the same opponent has no additional effect. Modify Memory is a mental enchantment effect, which costs 2 PP to manifest.

At level 5, the psion learns the "**Thought Leech**" power. The psion's brow erupts with an arc of crackling dark energy that connects with a creature within limited range. For every 3 PP spent, an enchantment currently affecting the target creature transfers to the psion, affecting her instead.

At level 6, the psion learns the "**Id Insinuation**" power. Tendrils of thought disrupt a characters's unconscious mind, slicing through her mental defenses. The character is confused: the next time she rolls for movement, she moves backwards around the board instead of forwards. She counts as passing over and landing on squares as normal. Id Insinuation is a mental enchantment effect, which costs 3 PP to manifest.

At level 7, the psion learns the "**Genesis**" power. A local density fluctuation precipitates the creation of a unique demiplane between two adjacent squares of the board within limited range. The psion chooses a card from the discard pile of either Community Chest or Chance, placing it under the edge of the board between the two adjacent squares. The chosen card is not returned to the deck—even for shuffling—unless the demiplane is dispelled.

The card becomes a quasi-real, polarized square on the board: Community Chest demiplanes exist only for the psion, whereas Chance demiplanes exist only for opponents.
* For characters of compatible polar alignment, the card is treated as a normal square on the board. It must be passed over as usual, and it adds to the distance between squares for the purpose of limited range calculations. A character landing on the demiplane is affected by the text of the chosen card, as though she had drawn it. Hence, the cleric's Divine Favor ability applies.
* For characters of opposite polar alignment, the square does not exist. It is ignored when moving, cannot be targeted, and is not included in area affects. Similarly, characters on the square are considered outside of existence from the perspective of an inversely aligned character. Hence, an inversely aligned character cannot target them with abilities, not even far-reaching abilities such as the cleric's Holy Smite or Wrath of God.
* In the case of multiple psion characters, consider each psion to have a distinct alignment for her own created demiplanes only.
* In the case of effects where a character of one polarity affects a character of the opposite polarity, the polarity of the target applies. E.g., if a wizard uses Telekinesis to shove a psion, the psion's trajectory will include her Community Chest demiplanes.

Genesis may only create one demiplane between each pair of adjacent squares, and only between two real non-demiplane squares. If a demiplane already exists between the two chosen squares, the existing one collapses in favor of the new one. Genesis is an enchantment effect which costs 4 PP + $40 to manifest.

At level 8, the psion learns the "**Psionic Blast**" power. The air ripples with mental force, blasting all opponents within limited range. All opponents are pushed to the square just outside of the affected range. Similar to the wizard's "Telekinesis" spell, opponents do count as passing over any squares that get crossed; however, the characters do not count as having landed on the final square. Psionic Blast costs 4 PP to manifest.

At level 9, the psion learns the "**Intellect Fortress**" power. The psion encases all characters within limited range—including herself—in a shimmering fortress of telekinetic force and determination. Intellect Fortress is a defensive power which costs 5 PP to manifest: the psion may use it in response to any character within range being affected by any ability. All characters within the fortress are unaffected by the triggering ability.

At level 10, the psion learns the "**Psychic Crush**" power. The psion's will crushes the mental essence of an opponent anywhere on the board. The opponent is returned to GO. The opponent does not collect $200, or enjoy any other of the usual benefits of passing GO. Psychic Crush is a mental effect, which costs 5 PP to manifest.

#### Psion tactics

*   Your powers are well suited to monopolizing the first edge of the board:
    *   Use Modify Memory to subvert opponents' weak properties.
    *   Use Id Insinuation on yourself for extra chances at purchasing property.
    *   Use Genesis to create Chance demiplanes on the first edge.
    *   Use Ego Whip on opponents after they land on your most punishing properties.
    *   Use Id Insinuation and Psychic Crush on opponents to inflict multiple rounds of pain.
    *   Use Mind Blast with an augmented range to align opponents in front of your most punishing properties. Seven squares away is normally statistically most likely, although some class abilities such as the fighter's Run may affect your decision.
*   Use Intellect Fortress as a bargaining chip to protect opponents in bad situations. They may agree to pay substantial sums of money to avoid effects which would be worse.
*   You can also use Intellect Fortress to nullify positive effects on opponents; for example, you can stop a wizard from Counterspelling the Modify Memory enchantment you placed on her earlier.
*   Use Thought Leech opportunistically to steal helpful enchantments, such as the wizard's Mage Armor and Invisibility (maybe even Slow in the right situation), the cleric's Shield of Faith, and the druid's Barkskin.
