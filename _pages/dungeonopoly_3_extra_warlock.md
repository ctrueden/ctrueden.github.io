The warlock draws power from a sinister pact with powerful entities.

#### Warlock abilities

Every warlock chooses a pact: Infernal, Fey or Dark. This choice impacts her abilities as she progresses.

At level 1, the warlock learns the "**Hex**" ability. Once per turn, either before or after moving, the warlock can place a curse on an opponent within limited range. The next time that opponent collects money from any source, the money is instead deposited into the central pot. Once money has been redirected in this way, the character is no longer considered cursed. Hex is an enchantment effect.

At level 2, the warlock learns the "**Eldritch Blast**" ability. Once per turn, either before or after moving, the warlock can shoot a blast of force at a cursed opponent within limited range. The opponent takes damage.

At level 3, the warlock develops supernatural defenses. She learns a spell according to her chosen pact:

*   [Infernal] "**Hellish Rebuke**" - In response to taking damage, the warlock can cast this spell to damage the attacker in return.
*   [Fey] "**Misty Escape**" - In response to taking damage, the warlock can cast this spell to teleport herself up to 5 squares forward or backward, and become hidden until her next turn. The warlock does not count as passing over the intervening squares, nor landing on her destination.
*   [Dark] "**Dark Delirium**" - In response to taking damage, the warlock can cast this spell to send the attacker to an illusory nightmare realm. The attacker's turn immediately ends, with no opportunity to use abilities, or roll again in the case of doubles.

At level 4, the warlock's Eldritch Blast grows stronger. Choose one of the following enhancements:

*   "**Agonizing Blast**" - The blast does 50% more damageâ€”i.e., $30 per level instead of the normal $20.
*   "**Eldritch Spear**" - The blast's range extends to line of sight.
*   "**Repelling Blast**" - In addition to damaging the opponent, the blast also pushes her up to 2 squares away. This movement counts as passing over and landing on squares as usual.
*   "**Vampiric Blast**" - The damage is paid to the warlock instead of to the bank.

At level 5, the warlock develops supernatural fortitude. This is an automatic effect which does not award EP. She gains a trait according to her chosen pact:

*   [Infernal] "**Fiendish Resilience**" - Any time she owes a fee (Luxury Tax, Income Tax, Community Chest, Chance or jail), she pays only half the cost, rounded up.
*   [Fey] "**Beguiling Defenses**" - Any time the warlock is targeted by an enchantment, the aggressor becomes cursed as described in the Hex ability above.
*   [Dark] "**Entropic Ward**" - Any time the warlock would be affected by an enchantment or take damage, roll 1d6\. On a 1, she is unaffected.

At level 6, the warlock selects a second Eldritch Blast enhancement from the above list.

At level 7, the warlock learns the "**Dark One's Own Luck**" ability. Before rolling 2d6 for movement, she may invoke this ability to roll 3d6 and choose which two dice to keep after seeing the results. This is a single use ability.

At level 8, the warlock selects a third Eldritch Blast enhancement from the above list.

At level 9, the warlock is granted a "**Book of Shadows**" containing forbidden secrets. She learns three spells of level 4 or less from any combination of other class lists.

At level 10, the warlock learns the "**Crown of Madness**" spell, which targets an opponent within limited range. The warlock forces the opponent to immediately use an ability of the warlock's choice, as the warlock dictates. The warlock cannot force an opponent to cast a spell with a casting cost. For example, a warlock could force a nearby wizard to cast Fireball to destroy property improvements on the wizard's current square, or force a nearby cleric to cast Holy Smite on an annoying bard. Crown of Madness is a mental effect with a $200 casting cost.

#### Warlock tactics

*   Keep all opponents cursed whenever possible, so that you can blast them for EP.
*   Use Repelling Blast to force opponents to pay rent on your properties.
*   For maximum brutality, select the Fiendish pact and choose Agonizing Blast early. This build damages opponents more often and more painfully.
*   For a more tactical warlock, select the Fey pact and choose Repelling Blast early. This build gives you control over your positioning, as well as that of your opponents.
*   To focus on defense, select the Dark pact and choose Vampiric Blast early. This build shuts down your opponents, gives you a chance to ignore harmful effects, and brings in more cash.
