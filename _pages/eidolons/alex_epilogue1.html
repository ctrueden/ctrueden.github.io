        <p>&nbsp;<meta charset="utf-8" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">--My first priority after leaving the temple of the Gods was to acquire a new (untraceable, as Ed pointed out) body.&nbsp; Ed planned to take care of this for me by murdering a bandit. :)&nbsp; (He's such a nice metal man.)&nbsp;<br /><br />--Next up is the stop in Arx.&nbsp; Ideally, I'd like to reacquire my own body and that of the orc I had previously been inhabiting; I don't know how feasible this will be, but I feel strongly that I need to try to a significant expenditure of effort.&nbsp; Also, this is when I deliver the Letter to the plenipotentiary.&nbsp; (To refresh your memories, I planned to essentially explain exactly what all we'd been dancing around during the trial: the existence of the Underdark, the plurality of inverted nexuses, the inevitability of their demise, the true identity of the &quot;Wind Tamer&quot; as a representative of a city of the Underdark, trying to take me back to the city from whence I came, etc.&nbsp; 'Cause I'm a vindictive bitch that way. :P&nbsp; Also, because I really think that their inversion of that nexus is a terrible idea, and maybe this will give them pause?&nbsp; If you want more detail, let me know.)&nbsp; THE LETTER IS TO BE LEFT WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF HOW I LEFT IT.&nbsp; As in, I'll hire someone to deliver it or something.&nbsp; I want it to get there, but I don't want to get stuck back in a jail cell in Arx.&nbsp;<br /><br />--When we leave Arx, I plan to try to get back in contact with the Orc tribe living in the walls.&nbsp; I'll return the body if I have it, and then inform them that thanks to the beneficence of Nerull, should they choose to accept it, a nexus shall be provided to them.&nbsp; No longer will they have to endure the Withering.&nbsp; (Yadda, yadda, insert proselytizing here; attempts to convert whole tribe to worship of Nerull, etc., etc. :P&nbsp; Also, of course, if any of them feel that they are already too withered to wish to go back to the cycle of refreshing, other alternatives are always and at any time available, praise be to the glory of Nerull. :P)&nbsp; In any event, any who choose to follow me (and Ed and Bijer, of course) can come with me to the outpost which is so conveniently empty of people. :)&nbsp;<br /><br />--Finally, now that all my issues are dealt with, I'm going to hang out with the metal men indefinitely.&nbsp; They seem likely to provide slaughter and shiny entertainment.&nbsp; Plus, really, I've got nothing better to do.&nbsp; Ed seems to have some greater purpose in mind, and those are always a good way to attract dead bodies.&nbsp;<br />I'll honestly and truly help him with his goals to the best of my abilities.&nbsp; I'll use the cure and buff spells in my repertoire to aid his allies.&nbsp; This is useful to him, and will only help to improve Nerull's (and my) cred -- or at least make all the stick-up-their-ass types pause a bit in confusion next time they meet a Nerull worshiper.&nbsp; (Whether they're on my side or not, that can only be a good thing. :P)&nbsp; I will use my harming spells and my ability to channel negative energy to sow chaos and death in the ranks of the enemy, which is also useful when one is aiding in a holy quest, or so I'm told. O:)&nbsp; And, well, once the people on the other side are dead . . . no one will notice or care if the occasional body goes missing, will they?&nbsp;<br /><br />--If my deity wishes me to do anything in particular, I will of course do it.&nbsp; If I am contacted by anyone else, my plans may change.&nbsp; However, I have no strong ties to any mortals, and can't really imagine anyone seeking me out at this point.&nbsp; The Hospitalers seem like as good a venue as any for furthering death and withering, while actually improving my personal reputation and the reputation of my deity (confusion, confusion, glorious confusion to mortal squishies :) ).&nbsp; I have no problems whatsoever with helping to save lives on one side, while ending lives on the other.&nbsp; They're all the same to me; if killing x and saving y makes me a &quot;good&quot; undead abomination while killing y would have made me an &quot;evil&quot; undead abomination, I'll be a &quot;good&quot; one and save myself a lot of unnecessary trouble. :P</span></p>      </div>
