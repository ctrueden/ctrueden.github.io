I cleaned up some typos and have tried again to send the components originally requested.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As I discussed briefly with Curtis, this email is fairly heavy on the non-canon (i.e. non-Pathfinder) stuff, but the vast majority of that is, well, my race. :P  Pathfinder doesn&rsquo;t really handle playing undead yet to the best of my knowledge, and my base race also needed modification, so I&rsquo;m a giant freaking headache right now, but I promise not to Jeff out on you later on. 0:)  As of this moment I have no plans for anything that&rsquo;s not in this email that&rsquo;s not current canon if that makes you feel better.  (But, well, the Undeath domain as a thematic element just makes so much <i>sense</i>! :) )  Anyway, when you have time, take a look at my proposals, and counter, alter, or veto until I have enough information to build the rest of my character. :)</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Also, Curtis:  It was the Cerebral Symbionts in Fiend Folio that I was trying to remember at lunch.  They start on pg. 216.  I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for, as more than one is not very friendly to the host creature, but the Fiendish Familiar might also have some useful abilities if Lucas is just looking for some ideas for what&rsquo;s possible for an ally of some sort.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1a.) Tentative race proposals:  Well, I&rsquo;m a half orc/half drow bhut, but those races need defining.  Here are my suggestions for a half-orc/half drow in Pathfinder, and a bhut template that is compared pretty much point-by point to the ghost template below.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The half-orc/half-drow assumes, of course, that the character was raised with the drow; Weapon Familiarity and Languages would be different otherwise.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font size="4"><b>Half-Orc/Half-Drow Racial Traits </b></font></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	+2 Strength, +2 Wisdom, &ndash;2 Constitution: </b>Half-orc/half-drow are physically strong and constantly on the lookout for danger, but their drow stock causes them to be frail of form.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Medium: </b>Half-orc/half-drow are Medium creatures, and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Normal Speed: </b>Half-orc/half-drow have a base speed of 30 feet.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Darkvision 60 feet: </b>Half-orc/half-drow can see in the dark up to 60 feet.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Weapon Familiarity: </b>Half-orc/half-drow are proficient with hand-crossbows, rapiers, and shortswords, and treat any weapon with the word &ldquo;elven&rdquo; or &ldquo;drow&rdquo; in its name as a martial weapon.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Keen Senses: </b>Half-orc/half-drow receive a +2 bonus on sight- and sound-based Perception checks.  They can make a Perception check to spot a secret or concealed door if they pass within 10 feet, regardless of whether or not they are actively looking.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Dark Elven Resistances: </b>Half-orc/half-drow get a +4 racial saving throw bonus against magic sleep effects and get a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Mixed Blood: </b>Half-orc/half-drow count as both orcs and drow for any effect related to race.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Languages: </b>Half-orc/half-drow begin play speaking Common, Elven, and Undercommon.  Half-orc/half-drow with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Orc, Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Giant, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Infernal, and Kuo-Toan (does this even exist?).</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Favored Class: </b>The favored class of half-orc/half-drow is barbarian or cleric.  This choice must be made at 1st level and cannot be changed.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font size="4"><b>Creating a Bhut </b></font></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ldquo;Bhut&rdquo; is an acquired template that can be added to any giant, humanoid, or monstrous humanoid.  The creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A bhut uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Size and Type: </b>The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead.  Do not recalculate the creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points.  It gains the incorporeal subtype.  Size is unchanged.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Hit Dice: </b>All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Speed: </b>Bhuts have a fly speed of 50 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Armor Class: </b>As an incorporeal creature, a bhut has no natural armor bonus but has a deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus or +1, whichever is higher.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Attack / Full Attack: </b>A bhut retains all the attacks of the base creature.  However, it may lose access to many attack options when interacting with corporeal creatures or objects unless using its corpsetheft special ability.  (Incorporeal creatures cannot take any physical action, such as a trip or a grapple, which would move or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions.)</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In addition, if the base creature has a purely physical attack such as a claw attack, it works normally against other incorporeal creatures.  Against all corporeal creatures and objects, a bhut&rsquo;s physical attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and force effects (such as mage armor) work normally against it.  A bhut also has a 50% miss chance when attacking a corporeal creature with a purely physical attack form, just as corporeal creatures do when attacking the bhut.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Finally, as an incorporeal creature, a bhut has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and its ranged attacks.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Special Attacks: </b>A bhut retains all the special attacks of the base creature, although it may lose access to some special attack options when interacting with corporeal creatures or objects unless using its corpsetheft special ability.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Special Qualities </b></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>	</i><b>Corpsetheft (Su):</b>  As a full-round action, a bhut can possess a dead humanoid body of any size.  The body animates immediately and is under the bhut&rsquo;s full control; treat it as a zombie of the appropriate size with several exceptions: First of all, the animated body retains the bhut&rsquo;s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as the bhut&rsquo;s alignment, base attack bonus, hit points, base saving throws, and level and class (if any).  Additionally, the animated body is not limited to single actions.  The bhut can use the zombie&rsquo;s bite attack, but the bite is not itself a natural attack for the bhut (-4 penalty on attack rolls).  It deals only 1d3 points of damage, and it provokes an attack of opportunity.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As long as the bhut inhabits the body, it is not affected by its earth vulnerability, nor does it gain the benefits of any attacks or special attacks which require use of the bhut&rsquo;s physical form.  Many bhuts make excellent use of the Bluff and Disguise skills in the state to make the animated body appear to be alive.  If the animated body is reduced to 0 vitality points, the bhut must exit the body and return to its incorporeal form; any damage done to the animated body is not transferred to the bhut&rsquo;s incorporeal form.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>	</i><b>Earth Vulnerability (Su):</b>  A bhut cannot abide contact with earth or stone when in its incorporeal state, and it cannot pass through such matter without taking 3d6 points of vitality damage per round.  Stone and earth weapons deal an additional 1d6 points of damage when they strike an incorporeal bhut, and they do not have a miss chance.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>	</i><b>Undead Type: </b><i> </i>As an undead creature, a bhut is immune to all mind-affecting effects, poison, <i>sleep </i>effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromantic effects (unless they specifically affect undead), and effects that require a Fortitude save unless they also work on objects (or are harmless).  It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, physical ability (i.e. Dexterity) damage, ability drain, energy drain, or fatigue or exhaustion effects.  It is not at risk of death from massive damage and all vitality must be depleted before any wound damage is taken; however, if it is reduced to 0 wounds or less, it is immediately destroyed.  A bhut cannot be raised or reincarnated, and resurrection or true resurrection works only if it is willing, turning a bhut back into the living creature it was before becoming undead.  A bhut uses its Charisma modifier for Concentration checks.  A bhut has darkvision (60-foot range, unless the base creature has a longer range).  A bhut does not breathe, eat, or sleep.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><i>	</i><b>Incorporeal Subtype:  </b>A bhut has no physical body.  It can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, holy water, or stone or earth (see earth vulnerability, under special qualities).  It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms except those which are stone- or earth-based and holy water.  Even when hit by effects which can affect a bhut, it has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force effects such as <i>magic missile</i>, or attacks made with ghost touch, stone, or earth weapons).</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A bhut can pass through solid objects at will.  It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total concealment (50% miss chance) from a bhut that is inside an object.  In order to see farther from the object it is in and attack normally, the bhut must emerge.  A bhut inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks.  A bhut cannot pass through a force effect.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A bhut passes through and operates in water as easily as it does in air.  A bhut cannot fall or take falling damage.  It has no weight and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight.  A bhut has an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when it cannot see.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Abilities: </b>Same as the base creature, except that the bhut has no Constitution or Strength score.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Skills: </b>An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard with sound-based Perception checks if it doesn&rsquo;t wish to be.  Other non-visual Perception checks to detect an incorporeal bhut, such as those using scent or blindsight, may also be ineffective or performed at a penalty.  However, a bhut&rsquo;s skills are the same as the base creature.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Environment: </b>Any, often as base creature.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Organization: </b>Solitary, covey (2-5), or colony (6-24).</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Challenge Rating: </b>Same as the base creature +2.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Treasure: </b>Standard.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Alignment: </b>Usually neutral evil.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>	Level Adjustment: </b>Same as the base creature +4.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The major differences between the bhut template I&rsquo;m proposing and ghost are:</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; must be giant or (monstrous) humanoid instead of practically anything for base creature</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; incorporeal all the time instead of ethereal most of time, incorporeal only when manifest</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; corpsetheft alone instead of manifestation and 1-3 other powers</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; earth vulnerability instead of . . . nothing, really</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; no ability bonuses instead of +4 Cha</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; lose Str and Con instead of just Con</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; 50 fly/perfect instead of 30 fly/perfect</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; no natural armor bonus against ethereal creatures (though also not ethereal most of time)</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; no skill bonuses instead of Perception, Search, and Stealth all at +8</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; no Turn Resistance instead of +4</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&ndash; no items appearing with bhut when it forms instead of 2d4 valued items from life plus all equipment</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">(though the bhut can inhabit a corpse and go wear new stuff)</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">BOTTOM LINE:  I went into this figuring I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to get lower than a +5 level adjustment, then I did the point-by-point comparison to the ghost, and went, &ldquo;huh.&rdquo;  So I&rsquo;m going to try to wheedle the +4, but if you&rsquo;re not buying me being an incorporeal undead (and really, it&rsquo;s pretty much just that &ndash; which confers flying, though the speed is the one and only place where bhuts compare favorably to ghosts &ndash; one ability, and the vulnerability) for just +4, I&rsquo;d like to add back in the natural bite attack and the Dreadful Appearance for +5.  The poison is fun, but just way too broken, and I really don&rsquo;t want to be getting close enough to bite things anyway. :P</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For reference, the original bhut can be found on pages 20-21 of the Fiend Folio, and the ghost template is on pages 116-118 of the Monster Manual 3.5.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">MINOR QUESTION:  Most of the brief descriptions of undead creatures (like, specifically, the bhut) simply say they&rsquo;re immune to ability damage, but the longer description of the undead type says the undead subtype confers immunity to <i>physical</i> ability damage.  I listed the latter in my write-up, both because I&rsquo;ve been tending to err on the less generous side for myself and because I tend to figure the long write-up of general undead qualities is more likely to be accurate, but I did wonder about that.  Is it common for many undead to be immune to mental ability damage, or are they just lazy in writing their descriptions?</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">1b.) Tentative class:  I&rsquo;m thinking probably a couple of levels of rogue &ndash; maybe as many as four, but definitely no more than that &ndash; and the rest cleric of Nerull.  I&rsquo;m definitely taking the Trickery domain, but I&rsquo;m thinking that for the other one I&rsquo;m going to try to talk you guys into letting me modify the Undeath domain from Libris Mortis into something which is in line with Pathfinder (and uses all spells which are actually in Pathfinder, of course).  If you don&rsquo;t want to let me do that, that&rsquo;s cool, but I figured it would make it easier to actually have abilities related to undeath if they were tied into the domain.  It&rsquo;s very tightly themed, and I modeled the abilities for first and eighth level very closely off of others already in the Pathfinder book.  See what you think:</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font size="4"><b>Undeath Domain</b></font></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>Deities: </b>Nerull, Wee Jas.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>CL 	Ability</b></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>1st 	</b><i>Fortify Undead </i>(Sp): You can touch an undead creature as a standard action, giving it turning resistance equal to one-quarter your caster level (round down, minimum +1).  This bonus lasts 10 rounds.  Once a creature has benefited from <i>fortify undead</i>, it can gain no further benefit from this ability for 1 day.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>8th 	</b><i>Aura of Undeath </i>(Su): You can emit a 30-ft. aura of undeath for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level.  You and your undead allies in the area gain a +2 profane bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saves, and skill checks, while each of your living foes takes a &ndash;1 penalty on such rolls.  (Living allies and undead foes are unaffected.)  These rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Domain Spells:</strong>&nbsp;1st&mdash;<em>detect undead</em>, 2nd&mdash;<em>command undead</em>, 3rd&mdash;<em>animate dead</em>, 4th&mdash;<em>enervation</em>, 5th&mdash;<em>magic jar</em>, 6th&mdash;<em>create undead</em></p><p>__________________________________________________________________________________</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a name="OLE_LINK1"></a>2.) My public description isn&rsquo;t ready yet.  My first try was just . . . bad.  I read it over again and promptly deleted it. :P  I&rsquo;ll send something to you guys tomorrow or something.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">3.) As I also believe I mentioned to Curtis, somehow I decided that drow have Polish (or other similar Eastern European) names, and orcs have Hopi names.  You just can&rsquo;t beat Polish for long strings of alveolar (and palato-alveolar, if I feel like showing off my linguistic nerdiness) consonants!  I also (mostly) know how they&rsquo;re supposed to be pronounced, so when I wrote them out for the drow in my backstory I changed all the spellings so they not only look even more foreign but so English speakers should generally (I hope) end up with approximately the pronunciation I was going for.  Hopi, on the other hand, has some really nice contrasting sounds (they seem to tend to use no more than one or two consonants in a row, for one thing, and they have a lot of stops and nasals in contrast to the Polish penchant for fricatives) and I liked giving the orcish tribal society names which came from a real tribal society.  There&rsquo;s no real reason that would have to be the case, but it fit the image I had for the orcs in my head, somehow.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Okay, I&rsquo;m going to shut up about language and names now.  I&rsquo;m a geek, I&rsquo;m sorry.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First, I should probably quickly explain that my character got named once by her mother, again when the drow decided to raise her as an experiment, and a third time when she became undead (though that was a self-done naming).  So I was a little unsure what to call her here.  I&rsquo;m going to go with &ldquo;Admatha,&rdquo; since that&rsquo;s the name the PCs will know her by.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Also, I&rsquo;ve named the city where she grew up Tane&rsquo;klenya.  (It&rsquo;s a melding of a &ldquo;drow&rdquo; word meaning &ldquo;immortal&rdquo; and a &ldquo;tiefling&rdquo; word meaning &ldquo;lion&rdquo; or &ldquo;large feline.&rdquo;  Language geek. :) )  I&rsquo;ve been assuming she ended up back there after she changed (or at least with that as the closest major city, which is actually preferable), though effectively as a different person &ndash; that&rsquo;s actually part of the reason for the different name &ndash; but I&rsquo;m perfectly happy to be somewhere else if that works better for you two.  Just let me know and I&rsquo;ll tweak the last bits of the backstory.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now, on to the NPCs:</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">a.) Anoka Kotori of the Istaqa tribe) &ndash; her mother, an orc</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Admatha (who was named Nukpana by her mother) spent her first two years with her mother, after which she was taken away to be raised by House Zo&rsquo;sha.  With one exception, she never again had any knowing contact with Anoka, but Anoka watched over her child as best she could from a distance.  It is also implied in the backstory that Anoka may have had some ties to Nerull herself.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Admatha remembers seeing her mother die fairly early in the multi-year horror that eventually led to her own death, but she didn&rsquo;t exactly go back and look for a body.  And even if she did, there could still be another copy of her mother around somewhere, I suppose, right? :P</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">b.) her unknown father, a drow</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Yeah, yeah, I know this one isn&rsquo;t named, but I&rsquo;ve got more than five anyway, so hush. :P  The circumstances of Admatha&rsquo;s birth were obviously a huge influence on her life, so he &ndash; or rather, his absence &ndash; becomes important.  He may well have been from House Zo&rsquo;sha, but that could also simply have been a delusion of Councilor Dob&rsquo;y&rsquo;slav&rsquo;s.  (See the backstory for more details on that.)</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">c.) Councilor Ludk&rsquo;dorek Zo&rsquo;sha</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">She was (and still is) the head of House Zo&rsquo;sha, the house which raised Admatha from age two to age thirteen.  It was most likely her influence with the ruling council of Tale&rsquo;klenya which saved Admatha&rsquo;s life as a baby, and certainly her influence which got the child, who was re-named Dy&rsquo;zytka at this time, educated (mostly) as a drow instead of completely as a slave.  She regarded Admatha as an experiment, and hoped to prove that a half-drow would be able to refresh at a non-inverted nexus.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">d.) Councilor Ch&rsquo;shek Dob&rsquo;y&rsquo;slav</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">She was (and still is) the head of House Dob&rsquo;y&rsquo;slav, another of the Thirteen Houses whose heads sit on the Drow Council.  However, she was convinced that Admatha was an abomination who should have been drowned at birth, and went out of her way to see that that mistake was rectified.  It is probable she was behind the &ldquo;accident&rdquo; which caused the massive cave-in which led to Admatha&rsquo;s eventual slow and painful death by Withering, though Admatha attributed the quake to her great-grandson Budzh&rsquo;sh, a more immediate personal tormentor of hers.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Ch&rsquo;shek&rsquo;s hatred of Admatha is rather irrational and borders on the psychotic, based in her perception that a reality quake is the only reason the child lived past birth.  If she ever finds out that the necromancer is in fact the child she believes dead, there is no telling what she might do to destroy her.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">e.) Budzh&rsquo;sh Dob&rsquo;y&rsquo;slav</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As the great-grandson of Ch&rsquo;shek Dob&rsquo;y&rsquo;slav, Budzh&rsquo;sh tormented Admatha throughout her childhood.  He was several years older and served as an apprentice instructor in the educational institution she attended.  He used this position to make her life miserable, giving her extra tasks, punishing her for nonexistent slights, and turning the few other children who might have become her friends against her.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Because of his vast knowledge on a wide variety of topics, and the large number of contacts he cultivated, as well as the obviousness of his personal grudge against her, when Admatha returned to Tale&rsquo;klenya after becoming a bhut she took revenge on him specifically.  She murdered him and inhabited his body to commit several crimes before leaving it near the edge of the city.  She then hid outside the city for some time before make her debut as Admatha Khalid, the necromancer.  Unfortunately, she was unaware that he was simply acting to please his great-grandmother the entire time he tormented her as a child, and if she ever finds out about Councilor Dob&rsquo;y&rsquo;slav&rsquo;s feelings it may prompt her to do something less than characteristically cautious or well-thought-out.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">f.) Matron Sh&rsquo;chepan</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">She is (and has been for over a century) the Head Councilor for the drow of Tale&rsquo;klenya.  House Sh&rsquo;chepan is the most powerful house in the city, though not quite the oldest or the largest.  Admatha has only met Matron Sh&rsquo;chepan (whose personal name few remember, and fewer would dare to say) once, but she was fairly certain in the first moment that this was one drow who is quite well aware of the secret behind a necromancer&rsquo;s powers.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Matron Sh&rsquo;chepan rules not out of fear, but out of sheer force of personality that makes going against her &ldquo;suggestions&rdquo; nearly unimaginable.  Even Councilors don&rsquo;t dare to disobey her edicts, and for Admatha, raised in the city Matron Sh&rsquo;chepan presides over, it would be nigh impossible.  It helps that Matron Sh&rsquo;chepan very, very rarely &ldquo;suggests&rdquo; anything truly appalling; for a drow she is remarkably even-handed and fair.  Tale&rsquo;klenya has prospered under her guidance.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">g.) V&rsquo;leron Zo&rsquo;sha</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">He was in charge of taking care of the younger children in House Zo&rsquo;sha during Admatha&rsquo;s childhood, the ones living dormitory-style anyway.  He also taught her how to pay attention to what was around her without drawing attention to herself, and the rudiments of being more unobtrusive, and how to persuade people that you belong right where you are (the better to observe longer).</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">h.) Matron (Bozy&rsquo;dar) Vyen&rsquo;cheslav</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A fourth councilor, this one didn&rsquo;t particularly care about the child Admatha, but has had more contact with the necromancer.  She is in charge of funerary rites for unclaimed bodies, and occasionally slips Admatha a few to experiment upon in Adramyttium, Admatha&rsquo;s hidden lair, in exchange for services rendered.</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">__________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">4.) Uh, yeah.  As I mentioned to Curtis, my backstory is getting . . . <i>long</i>.  Multiple handwritten pages have happened while I&rsquo;ve been working at the pool and such things.  And it&rsquo;s, uh, not done yet, not to mentioned not typed up.  I&rsquo;ll try to get that to you guys as soon as possible, but since I know that&rsquo;s a lower priority, and you haven&rsquo;t read some of the others that have been sent, I&rsquo;m not going to worry about it too much right now. :)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
