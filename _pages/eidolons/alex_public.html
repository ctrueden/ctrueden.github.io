<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Admatha Khalid is a mysterious, dark-cloaked figure who resides in (near?) the city of Tane'klenya.&nbsp; She arrived in the city several months ago, shortly after the great cave-in occurred near the spontaneously inverted nexus.&nbsp; She seems to know more about the power structure of the city than a newcomer should, but remains quiet about the source of her knowledge.</span>&nbsp; If approached, she speaks in a surprisingly melodious low alto voice which seems at odds with her rather frightening appearance.</p> <p>In recent months, Admatha has made something of a name for herself accompanying two warforged, Ed and Biger, on their holy quest to heal the sick and injured, defend the defenseless, and protect the innocent.&nbsp; Many people are skeptical as to the true motivations of a cleric of Nerull in participating in the founding of the Order of the Common Shield, but Admatha has worked tirelessly towards these goals and maintains that it is both Nerull's will and her true desire to be where she has been and to do what she has been doing.&nbsp; She also suggests that perhaps people do not fully understand the truth of Nerull's ways. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>(NOTE:&nbsp; APPEARANCE&nbsp;IS&nbsp;SUBJECT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;CHANGE.&nbsp; :P) </em></p><p><em>Admatha is almost always in her trademark hooded, black cloak.&nbsp; Otherwise, her appearance varies. <br /></em></p><p><em>Currently, if you can see under the hood at all, Admatha appears to be a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">fairly well-built half-dwarven, half-elven male</span>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">heavy-set gray elven male</span>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">reasonably well-built eladrin female</span>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">slightly-built elven female</span>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">husky dragonborn female</span>&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">sickly-looking dwarven female</span> rather average-sized female dwarf. <br /></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
