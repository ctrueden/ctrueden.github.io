        <p>Real age/Apparent age: (in human equivalent right now) 33/17</p>
<p>Appearance: Tall, and a little gangly. Hiding a sense of balance within. Hair cut to very utilitarian aspect. The only conscious sign of a femine aspect, is a beautiful necklace [she keeps it quite that this belonged to her mother/creator]. She keeps two pet dogs, both trained in guard duty, along with her horse, although it is clear that she is not a ranger/druid/&amp;c as soon as she is in nature. She seems uncomfortable when not in an Urban center, never at ease. She obviously doesn't trust magic, and finds it's practitioners somewhere between tiresome, and foolish; but she does not let this blind her to the good individuals might posses. Her armour is covered in spikes, as is her Heavy shield.</p>
<p>Hair: short, dyed blue [this is a public sign of her level of training in her combat school, ala belts (colour, not length)]. She will start describing the benefits of her school to any and all other combat styles, and will keep GOING on, if anyone asks.<br />
Voice: she has a surprisingly squeaky voice for her build, and is very self conscious of it.<br />
eyes: one green, one gray. Again, self-conscious of it</p>
<p>non-combat dress: Very plain, almost spartan aesthetic, from her long training/living regimen. Never takes her mother's necklace off. It is all she has left of her Mother, who died while she was very young.</p>
<p>Class: Fighter 7<br />
BAB: 7/2<br />
Weapon Training: Close<br />
Bravery +2 vs. fear<br />

<p><strong>Story<br />
</strong></p>
<p>As a child, she was a very happy, talkative creature. She would talk your ear off about the things she'd seen that day, and there was always more to see in the nexus-city-guard of Tat'enda. Her people had been guarding this port for all comers since time before memory. They had built up a large garrison, and all were welcome. Only the guard of the city were allowed to wear weapons non-peace-bound in the city limits, and any crime more serious then petty theft resulted in either a decade of work in the farms, or expulsion. The people of Tat'enda were welcoming to strangers, for they knew the Gods has blessed them in the strength &amp; fertility of their nexus-city. The visitor's hostel was always full of new comers, and the temple-area was full of visitors at all times. The guard of Tat'enda took their defense of the city very seriously, and demanded the same from their members. The few bards that are members, for example, have never been known to tell stories of glory, only stories of endurance. Tat'enda is a dry city, as alchohol or other vices might tempt some to break the all-important peace. The prison for non-violent fellons was kept for the region in Tat'enda, as well, as it would be safer to keep those who's crimes did not deserve withering near a nexus. To these petty criminals were daily sent messengers from Saint Cuthburt to change their ways, and such was the power of their words (and the peace evident in the city), that many do change their ways, and are welcome as members of Tat'enda.</p>
<p>An example of why the city must be guarded was early impressed on Arwel. She had been playing with her dolls in her father's weapon room (it was always the quietest), when she heard the ringing of the alarm bells: Invaders! Arwel had no way of knowing it then, but it was a major turning point in her life. Her mother had been going out to the Church of Cuthburt's main temple, to petition for Arwel to be taken as an apprentice there (as her interest in peace &amp; her talkative voice might make her a welcome addition), when the barbarian tribe struck. It was the Barbarians of Gergana's intention to take this rich city on a nexus, and make it their own, throwing all others out, and making them pay mightily for the ability not to wither. This would have been just another attack, easy to fend off, but that day all seemed against the people of Tat'enda. Their magics fizziled, their walls were broken easily, and their streets were soon filled with blood and screaming. Arwel was just about to go out to see what the matter was, when her older brother ran in, and locked them both in. She was about to protest, when he flung her down with him onto a tarp, and hid them both, his hand clamped so tightly over Arwel's own, that it hurt: he had in fact broken her nose accidentally in the need to keep her silent, for the house was filled with the rampaging Gerganian horde. Luckily, as was the fashion in Tat'enda, their grandfather who has built the house, had built the weapon's room such that it was a hidden room. The screams and curses from those outside the door shook Arwel, as did her own brother's violence against her, though she soon understood the reason. Her brother was only 11, but at four years her elder, he was like a general, or a god to her, and the look of fear in his face shook her more then anything else that day, until word of their mother's rape &amp; death in the city streets met them. Her father was shaken, and was never the same man. Only her brother,<font class="heavymedium"> Evaristo Joaquim </font>was there for her, as she grew up, and he did his best. But Arwel was broken inside, and decided to dedicate her life to stopping as much as possible what had happened to her her family from happening to anyone else's. She joined the City-guard-auxillary training group at the youngest possible age (9), a feat that had never happened before. Her father's (Gawain Trevor) heart was broken even more, as he knew that it was his wife's (Enid Braith) dying task to bring Arwel into the priesthood, or at least to be a paladin, but he never told Arwel this, and she never learned it. Her distrust of magic widened as she grew older, and learned more about the attack, how the great Druid working for the leader of Gergana had used magic to fend them off, as well as her experience in shifts/quakes during combats resulting in her partner's magics disappearing/changing in ways that she was not ready for in combat.</p>
<p>She trusts herself, and her pets more then anyone else right now, other then her brother, Evaristo Joaquim (joker). He has risen to assistant mayor of Tat'enda, and has sent his days trying to help the city stay strong, and continue it's mission. Her time in the guard's Auxillary is now at an end, and she must take on a new, fearful (to her) task: Those who wish to join the guard-proper must travel. they must learn of other lands, learn their tongues, learn their customs, so as to best serve the Nexus of Enda, on which Tat their ancestral leader formed Tat'enda. She has never been away from home, nor any further into the &quot;wilds&quot; as she refers to the rest of the world, then the farms that raise the food for Tat'enda.</p>
<hr />
<p>In not to distant future, i hope to have Arwel take leadership, and take on a twin of herself: Either the self that would have been sent to Cuthburt training if her mother hadn't stayed to speak with the flower girl longer (thus delaying her, and not allowing her time to get to safety), or if her father HAD decided to tell her. I'm not sure which right now, as both could have really interesting story-telling aspects to it.</p>
<p>some minor parts of this would change in flavour if i decided that i want her to be a warforged still, but I'd like to make the warfored still have clearly defined sexes, at least from that city.</p>
<p><strong>Personality<br />
</strong></p>
<p>she doesn't like/trust magic, or magicians. She doesn't hate druids, as their magic is necessary for the farms of Tat'enda to be as bountiful as they are to feed the city, and it's visitors. she trusts herself, and those who earn her trust. With her right now, those are only her pet dogs, and her horse/pony.</p>
<p>planning on staying full fighter with the main version of her, and taking the feats that let her wield &amp; fight with a shield at the same time as the weapon in her other hand. (hence the close fighting)</p>
<p>i welcome thoughts/ideas.</p>

<p><strong>NPCs<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brother</strong>, <strong>Mother</strong>, <strong>Father</strong> (see above)<br />
<br />
<strong>Tuan Hun-Gurrr:</strong> Her master who trained her in the Guard. He was a role model to her, and she looked up to him very much. At over 300, he was one of the oldest on the Guard, but do to his travels, and other adventures, appeared to be in his early 30s. As a war-forged, his focus to his Duty was exacting, and he expected no less from his fleshy followers. The mix of drill Sargent, uncle, and friend was a hard one for any of the trainers to maintain, but Tuan Hun-Gurrr mastered all of these. The only thing he loved more then his city, was the children he helped bring up to protect it. He had picked up the habit of smoking somewhere in his travels, which was all the more curious, as he did not inhale it; nonetheless, he was never without a lit pipe.</p>
<p>When Arwel felt lost, and alone, Tuan was someone who understood her anger, &amp; her fears. He too, had lost many friends over the centuries.&nbsp; He sponsored her fast rise in the Guardship, and has high hopes for her future. He knows that her unreasonable distrust of magic will lessen as she is exposed to more, and different, practitioners in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Tudor Mabyn Gwladus:</strong> Arwel's mixed-up-relationship-having boy/girl. Tudor is a very unique creature. a true hermaphrodite, s/he was picked on a lot as a child. Arwel most ignored it until after her mother's death; s/he was very kind to her during this troubling time, and they became very close. Some suspected that they were a couple, but even they could not tell you for sure. Always on the verge of something, Arwel's training, Tudor's uncomfortableness with it's gender/s, &amp; Tudor's gestalt training in Scout/warlock prevented things from going any further, but their mutal respect, love, and caring kept them together. They both had tears in their eyes when Arwel left the city to go on her journey, and they each have a locket of each other's photo &amp; hair on thier persons at all times. These were gifts from Arwel's brother. Unbenonst to EITHER Tudor, or Arwel, the lockets will send out a signal upon the death of either of them, to the other (with GM permission).&nbsp; Tudor's non/gender is one the unconscious reasons Arwel keeps to ambiguous styles of dress &amp; fashion.</p>
<hr />
<p><u><strong>Quickspur's Ally<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p>As in Weapons of&nbsp;Legacy p. 129-131. Costs 30mp out of the initial pool. If you choose not to gestalt, and wish to avoid the negatives as you level up, pay 2mp per level.</p>      </div>
