<p>Arwel had been a Heavily armoured fighter, and pretty much always had her shield nearby, at the very least. That changed significantly, recently, when St. C decided to step in, and hurry up the maturing process that this version of Arwel was undergoing, and took advantage of a &quot;cheat code&quot; to meld two varients of Arwel together. So far things are... weird.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She had been simply fairly reserved, but that is from a different source now, as she tries to figure out who she is... what the nature of self is, the nature of others are in this reality... realities...</p>  <p>When not in her armour, Arwel would normally be wearing a plain white tunic, with a blue trim, and has a blue stain applied to the top of her skull.</p>  <p><a href="/eidolons/joel/public">Za'har</a>&nbsp;&amp; she have been friends for a while now, traveling the world together, been in a few scrapes, and have grown to trust each other. Haroon was a charge of hers, whom she hopes is growing up now that he has requested to be without a watcher. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She discoverd that a quake took away all that she loved, and that others don't like it when she stands up for what is right, irregardless of the consequences. Her new, more mature personality, has made her realize that maybe not everyone is trying to be a law-abiding citizen of the world, and that more of them need to be taught a mother-fucking-lesson. Luckily for them, St. C assigned her.</p>      </div>
