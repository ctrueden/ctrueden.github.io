                    <p><strong>Second character concept<br />
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>Before the technomages built their first great city, before the Ideologues struck their bargain with their gods, there was the thieves' guild: The Invisible Hand. &nbsp;First formally organized thousands of years ago, the Guild has been involved in every major historical event since it's inception. &nbsp;It helped gather knowledge and supplies for the first technomage city. &nbsp;It helped organize the Ideologues and helped them strike their great bargain to prevent withering.</p>
                    <p>The guild is very secretive about it's members. &nbsp;Once a potential recruit is identified, they are given a task. &nbsp;Usually a member plays the role of an easy mark, but with a note in their purse. &nbsp;If the recruit succeeds at the task, they acquire a single black earring. &nbsp;The earring is invisible to all except for the intended owner, and someone wearing an equivalent or higher ranked earring. &nbsp;It is also a conduit to send short messages to members. &nbsp;It is possible for member to intentionally lower the rank of their earring temporarily so that they may be identified as a member by lower ranked members.</p>
                    <p>I was brought into the Guild several hundred years ago. &nbsp;My particular talents made me an ideal recruit. &nbsp;I can manipulate the Flow in such a way as to split reality such that both I and the original owner both posses a particular object. &nbsp;There are some limits on the size and weight of what I can duplicate. &nbsp;The process also takes a lot out of me, so I can't run my own item duplication shop. &nbsp;Also, no magical properties are retained in the copy. &nbsp;But even with these restrictions, this is a potent ability. &nbsp;No one knows when a theft has taken place if the original remains.</p>
                    <p>I don't know how many members the guild has, just that I've had a few promotions. &nbsp;I am currently in charge of acquiring information for the Guild. &nbsp;My skill is especially useful in duplicating scrolls and books. &nbsp;Also, with interest in the prophesy running high, information is quite valuable. &nbsp;I will gladly sell research, no matter the source, to either side... if the price is high enough.</p>
                    <p>I have a member or two placed in prominent research labs on both sides. &nbsp;Sure, they aren't really thieves, but they are incredibly useful. &nbsp;In exchange for their help, we feed them morsels of research from other locations to help them gain prominence. &nbsp;This is a fairly new program, so I only have one subordinate that has gained enough of a reputation to run his own lab. &nbsp;Most members are lower level researchers, but climbing the ladder fast.</p>
                    <p>We also have our own lab hidden in the bowels of a technomage city. &nbsp;This is valuable information we're peddling, so it pays to understand it ourselves. &nbsp;If the information will lead to an increased demand in certain substances, or if it's found that using nodes or not using nodes will be the cause of the apocalypse, we want to be the first to know. &nbsp;I am fairly confident that the Guild has the greatest collection of information on the prophesy, and will be the first to decipher it.</p>
                    <p>Who am I? &nbsp;I am the local street vendor. &nbsp;I am the delivery boy, the city guard, the withered hag begging for scraps on the side of the road. &nbsp;Once, long ago, I was trailing a particularly elusive mark, a noble that seemed to disappear around every corner. &nbsp;I eventually figured out he was changing his appearance every time he ducked out of sight for a moment. &nbsp;I had to learn to identify him by his walk. &nbsp;It also didn't hurt that he only went to a few places. &nbsp;He was wasting such a gift on visiting his mistresses. &nbsp;I could let something like that go to waste. &nbsp;Eventually I tracked him back to his house and watched him store the mask in his study. &nbsp;An hour later, it was mine, with a worthless copy waiting for him for his next adventure. &nbsp;I haven't taken it off since.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;Journal Entries</p><p><strong>Session 0:</strong><br />	Did I mention I hate goblins?  I mean really hate goblins. <br /><br />	I had been spending some time with the Blackspear tribe.  They certainly have an “interesting” lifestyle, and by interesting I mean disgusting.  They have a social order similar to many of the nomadic tribes, but strength and vileness is valued instead of wisdom and courage.  Last time I do that. <br /><br />	I thought I had things under control.  Sure, the tribe leader, (and well most of the rest of the tribe) was taken with me, but as long I played the game with him, he kept everyone else at bay.  Then his patience ran out and he decided to take what I wouldn't give him.  Mobbing me, tying me up, and keeping my guarded is not a way to win my favor (of course, not being a goblin helps).   Sure, I could have gotten out, but I was filled with a twisted curiosity about how things were going to play out.<br /><br />	I didn't get my chance.  A little goblin named Naxks decided he needed to help spring me, and the gesture was too kind to pass up.  Naxks was the runt of the tribe, at least until recently.  He's been playing with powers that are better left alone, but it won him a little respect... well, respect isn't the right word, more like a gave a little dose of fear into his tribesmen.  He was now even less accepted then before, but at least they left him alone.<br /><br />	Anyways, he was failing to refresh, and not getting the respect he wanted, and needed to leave.  I'm not sure what motivated him to help me out, but he didn't seem so keen on bringing me along.  I stuck with him anyways.  I wanted to find out, and besides, I knew quite a bit more about the world beyond his tribe.<br /><br />	He was being lead off on a specific path, and I tagged along.  He said he was off to find a way to refresh.  &lt;Need reminder of exactly what happened here, I think there was a ceremony to destroy a reversed nexus that he tried to disrupt, but then everything collapsed and we ended up in the underworld.&gt;<br /><br />	&lt;refresher on meeting other characters and getting selected for the guild&gt;<br /><br />	&lt;refresher on the prophesy about the place that I'm looking for&gt;<br /><br />	<br /><br /><strong>Session 1:</strong><br /><br />	I am in Eloyes, a former free city that is in the process of joining the Empire.  Or was.  I'm not there very long when a massive horde army appears from the Southwest.  There really isn't anything from that direction, so it's the least defended side of the city.  I went to take a look, but didn't hang around long.  Any assistance I could provide wouldn't have any bearing on the outcome.  <br /><br />	I'm looking for someone who is to murder the Emperor so off to the nobles' quarters I go.  Along the way I see that there are a team of fairly powerful necromancers marching towards the nobles' quarters as well.  The captain of the city guard was flying all over the place on her nitemare, and tried to fight the necromancers, but didn't really have much effect.  Everyone that fell to them ended up joining their ranks.<br /><br />	I continued to where the Emperor was staying to hear rumors of his demise.  I saw the crystal sword that was part of the vision sticking through his dead body.  Sigh.  I can't say I like the empire or the emperor, but now I need to find whoever did this in this mess.<br />	(Dragonborn were still while the sword was in the emperor.)<br /><br />	I leave the palace, but head towards the nexus.  No sign of him, and everyone who can is fleeing the city.  I'd never find him in this so I decided to leave as well.  (Did I see anything with Mark's character?).  On my way out, this voice was asking me a lot of annoying questions.  Turns out it belongs to an old (and strange) warforged bard.  He wanted to know who I was looking for, but I had no way to describe my mark, so I had to be vague and move on.<br /><br />	I found strange guy with a little grasshopper man talking away from everyone else.  The little grasshopper seems to be the guy I'm looking for, as I see the image of the sword in his immediate past.  Curiously enough, I don't see anything about the man.<br /><br />	They make their way to a small fort outside of town where many of the remaining guards along with their captain have retreated to.  They go in and so do I.  The captin organized her guards and then gathered up a group that included me, the man (and the grasshopper) and the bardic warforged.  We discussed what we knew.  Apparently the death of the Emporer is a rummor that the captin seems to want to ignore.<br /><br />	The grasshopper has remained hidden with the other man throughout the evening.  I sneak into the room at night and manage to catch his attention.  I take him into my room and while he sits on my shoulder, I show him the scroll that I have for him.  To me it just looks blank, but he begins to weep.  We chat for a minute and I recommend he stays hidden for the time being.  He also agrees to help me <br /><br />	In the morning, we check out the town, and it's deserted.  The invasion did a number on the town, but they, and the necromancers have all left.  We decided to follow the trail and shortly end up in the wilderness.<br /><br />	Here, the grasshopper decided to play as though he just came across us in the forest, but offered to help guide us.  We need his help, as he is obviously Fey, and these words aren't friendly to outsiders.    I don't think the captain bought the story.  He has his secrets, and if I want his aid, I'm going to need help him keep them.<br /><br />	There was also a notable pillar of smoke from somewhere a little deeper in the woods.  We found our way there and discovered the wreckage of a flying machine and broken warforged.  His sound of his speech is out of sync with his mouth.  He goes by Ed, and is hear as an explorer.  He may be able to help me as well.<br /><br />&nbsp;Quake!  Huge Quake!!!  I haven't felt a quake that like in a long time.  There might be far reaching ramifications, but the only obvious change is that Isaline and her nitemare are gone.  In there place is Sahrat and his bear Barnabas.  Sahrat is of elven decent, though the exactly linage is blurred.<br /><br />	We followed the robot to the nearest nexus and camped for the night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 1.5:</strong><strong><br /></strong></p><p>(I learn info on each of the characters in the party by looking into their histories. &nbsp;Each seems to have some fragments missing and each has something which strikes me as a "fountain of life energy" in their past. &nbsp;This seems like a very fateful group, and this are bound to get interesting!</p><p><strong>Biger</strong> –</p><ul><li>His past lens is normal, except for a large crack through it</li><li>Like most warforged, Biger's past lens is quite narrow, though less narrow than most.</li><li>Simone sees his history as a performer, traveling to other cities to deliver messages and perform. She sees a cleric of Olidammara sneakily turn the crank, at the sharp edge of the lens fragment.</li><li>Simone sees him being built, taking shape, by Yolarlen Budonga and her team.</li><li>Sees a small, gold-cloaked figure attach a crank to Biger's torso in the night, after the workers had gone home.</li></ul><p><strong>Wrin</strong> –</p><ul><li>Past lens is extremely narrow, and focused.</li><li>Very short lifespan in its current form.</li><li>Reads as an object, rather than a person.</li><li>Sees flashes of a gnome with golden hands, wearing a welding mask, feverishly welding.</li></ul><p><strong>Ed</strong> –</p><ul><li>Past is much more varied than normal.</li><li>This warforged has played a thousand roles in past years. Spy, warrior, thief, magician, warlord, madman, ascetic, leader, priest... but always highly skilled at what it does—never a beggar, except by choice.</li><li>One thing quite clear through the lens is repeated battles with a much tougher-looking warforged clearly a size category larger than him. This warforged is often present, either by Ed's side or in opposition to him, as the memories flow by.</li><li>One such vision that stands out is the two warforged journeying through the Feywood together, along with an eladrin woman. And then, a quake... and she is gone, a gnomish flying machine in her place.</li><li>Many scenes of Beta (Ed, before he was called Ed) training with a small, agile-looking elven woman. Some brief flashes of Beta fighting this woman in the city streets, as well as him striking a woodsman with a devastating blow...</li><li>Lastly, scenes of Beta being built and rebuilt many times by two gleeful little gnomes.</li></ul><p><strong>Joe </strong>–</p><ul><li>Unlike everyone else, past is crystal clear.</li><li>Joe is in a desert village bringing food to a family with a withered child. Instinctively, he reaches out to the girl to help her, and somehow channels life energy into her, reversing her withering—but he finds himself withering an equal amount in exchange. Horrified, he involuntarily reverses the process, stealing her life force to heal himself. He is in ecstasy. Before he can control himself, only a pile of dust remains.</li><li>Joe is fighting a familiar-looking dwarven necromancer, who seems to possess some sort of control over bones.</li><li>Simone sees a village of other humans.</li><li>Village is obscured, as though the world itself is a shadow. Can't tell if it's real, or an illusion.</li><li>Sees flashes of Joe on a quiet night, but cannot see who he is with. Feels a massive quake, and the villagers scatter to the winds.</li><li>That quake felt unique—except for the recent one that swapped Isaline with Sahrit.</li></ul><p><strong>Kith</strong> –</p><ul><li>Substantial portions of his past are obscured, as though by protective magics.</li><li>Sees Kith engaging in back alley deals with a dirty man with alcohol on his breath.</li><li>Something is funny about the dirty man; feels familiar somehow.</li><li>Sees Kith wounded and unconscious, a young girl leaning over his tiny form and wiping his sweating brow.</li><li>Sees Kith in a cage, in a beautiful dark palace (Zelatar?), surrounded by monstrous forms poking at him through the bars, sneers of admiration and envy on their faces. Upon a fearsome throne sits a handsome yet terrible satyr... and flashes of terrible sexual rites that no one should ever have to endure...</li><li>Sees pieces of Kith's escape, but cannot see all the details. Just flashes of Kith's cage smashing to the ground.</li></ul><p><strong>Sahrit</strong> –</p><ul><li>Past is sharply split in half (like glasses for two eyes, with different prescriptions), though still many similarities.</li><li>Sees flashes of the Fochlucan incident, but something is missing. Just flashes of human in a dark brown cloak's face and his hand branding Sahrit.</li><li>Sees a brief flash of Sahrit in ecstasy, but strangely cannot see the woman he is with.</li><li>In one lens eye, sees an eladrin woman giving birth. The same human in a dark brown cloak watches as the halfling midwife urges her along. When it is over, the man caresses the exhausted mother's cheek, and Simone senses something dark and malevolent pass through his hand and into her body.</li><li>In the other lens eye, simultaneously, Simone sees an elven woman giving birth, with the same human in a dark brown cloak watching as the same halfling midwife takes her through it. Afterward, the man caresses the mother's cheek, but this time with genuine tenderness and no apparent ill effect.</li></ul><p><strong>Barnebus -</strong></p><ul><li>Curiously enough, the bear has a very long an illustrious past. (which I did not write down)</li></ul><p><strong>Session 2:</strong></p><p>I&nbsp;can still feel the aftermath of the last quake. &nbsp;The air is just charged with energy. &nbsp;That was one powerful quake!</p><p>We refresh at a nexus and start setting up camp for the night. &nbsp;I&nbsp;take first watch with Kith and Ed. &nbsp;I want to talk to Kith, but I&nbsp;need some time to consider what I've seen about my traveling companions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My watch ends and I&nbsp;finally get to sleep when four overcharged orcs appear from the nexus. &nbsp;Their skin is covered in tentacles and their eyes are glowing with nexus energy. &nbsp;I&nbsp;look into their past to see that they are from the wastes. &nbsp;I know the technoprophets use the nexuses for transportation so that must be what has happened here. &nbsp;Maybe that blather about inoculation wasn't just a stonewall. &nbsp; The orcs seem to have been corrupted by the journey. </p><p>The fight doesn't start off well. &nbsp;They take down Ed and the bear with little trouble. &nbsp;Things are looking desperate when Biger summons some glitter dust and I send a couple off to dreamland. &nbsp;We get Ed back up, and with my help, we manage to kill them.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were joined by another friend of theirs. &nbsp;This one was larger the others and begins to rage. &nbsp;We manage to confuse him and take him down. </p><p>While we are cleaning up, the orcs that were merely dead manged to get up. &nbsp;We stopped the big one again, but two of the others touched a ley line and managed to teleport back through the nexus.</p><p>A few of the others clean off the items they left behind. &nbsp;I&nbsp;don't really have any interest in any of it. &nbsp;It does seem curious that everything except the rings they were wearing seemed corrupted.</p><p>I'm glad we can hold our own in a fight. &nbsp;Where we are going is only going to get more dangerous.</p><p>We learned that Joe is a necromancer who can absorb and recall the essence that remains in the dead. &nbsp;Though I don't know if he's more or less creepy than Sahret. &nbsp;Probably more. &nbsp;So far Joe seems to make practical use of his abilities, and isn't consumed by them. &nbsp;I'll just keep a little distance to be safe.</p><p>Sahret performs a cleansing ritual on the nexus. &nbsp;This should protect us from any more unwanted visitors for the remainder of the night at least. &nbsp;I've seen the ritual performed before, but I cannot perform it.</p><p>We discussed the attack on the city. &nbsp;I&nbsp;mention that I saw the emperor dead with the sword though him. &nbsp;Sahret claims the sword was destroyed, though I&nbsp;don't know how he knows that, or how it happened. &nbsp;But it's our best guess at what the necromancers are after.</p><p>I&nbsp;have many questions of my companions and will need to ask a lot of questions in the morning. &nbsp;This attack has also raised a lot of unanswered questions.</p><p>Who sent the orcs?</p><p>Where they deliberatly sent after us, or for another reason? &nbsp;Were they just stragglers from the invading force?</p><p>Is this how the invasion force was assembled?</p><p>What, if any coordination was there between the necromancers and the invasion force?</p><p>Why was the emperor killed? &nbsp;Does that have anything to do with my vision about the empire causing a catastrophe?</p><p>What lies ahead?</p><p>----</p><p>Notes on Simone's state:</p><p>Simone's primary goal is still to satisfy her curiosity. &nbsp;She knows that the death of the emperor will have ramifications, but she doesn't know what they will be. &nbsp;She doesn't know why Kith did what he did and she wants to find out. </p><p>She's loyal to the guild in so far that they provider with interesting information and give her interesting things to do. &nbsp;She knows the power of information and will respect the secrets of the guild.</p><p>She's starting to feel a little bit of danger, but so far, danger has been something she can run away from or talk her way out of. </p><p>Her concerns have been, and continue to be, primarily for her self. &nbsp;The current events around her have a large macro effect, but doesn't do much to affect anything she really cares about yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 3</strong></p><p>Story time! &nbsp;Everyone that I'm traveling with is special in some way. &nbsp;They are all quite powerful and have lived such interesting lives. &nbsp;Almost everyone is missing a piece or two, and Sahrit even seems to have two pasts. &nbsp;I&nbsp;wonder if he has two presents as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was a little nervous about exposing their histories, lest some secret get loose that they would prefer to keep. &nbsp;I'm sure I got close to that line, but I don't think I crossed it. &nbsp;A few people were unaware of the specifics of some items of their past, such as Biger's crank getting attached, or Eidylol's long history.</p><p>Joseph seemed relieved to have his secret exposed. &nbsp;Or maybe it was that we didn't persecute him for his gift, and that we heard him out. &nbsp;He introduced us to Ann, the remains of the little girl he withered to death. &nbsp;She seems like a sweet and playful little girl, though Joseph claimed I was the first person she had warmed up to. &nbsp;Warms the heart. &nbsp;I hope he can do right by her. &nbsp;And I&nbsp;hope I&nbsp;can chat with her some more at some point soon.</p><p>Thankfully Joseph's confession took ran until another major quake happened and we didn't get to Kith. &nbsp;Kith has an ugly past, and some ugly secrets that I'm sure he'd prefer to remain secret. &nbsp;I prefer they remain secret as well.</p><p>I&nbsp;told him that I&nbsp;knew that he killed the emperor. &nbsp;He thought that was a bold accusation. &nbsp;I&nbsp;think he misunderstood me, I wasn't looking for confirmation. &nbsp;I&nbsp;explained that I&nbsp;saw it in his past, and that the scroll that I&nbsp;showed him was for the one who assassinated the emperor. &nbsp; I&nbsp;explained that I had no problems with his actions, and I&nbsp;wanted to help him keep his secret. &nbsp;He replied that he was glad that he didn't have to kill me, and acknowledged that either could kill the other if we so chose.</p><p>So, as I said, as Joseph finished, another large quake happened. &nbsp;Biger and Sahrit vanished and were replaced with Haroun and Arwel. &nbsp;Arwel is a Dragonborn that I've met previously, as she runs a small hostel. &nbsp;She's quite the accomplished fighter, though she likes to go on about her training a bit much.</p><p>Arwel also had the Emperor-slayer sword. &nbsp;He was part of a group that was hired to transport the sword, but they were under attack when the quake happened. &nbsp;Not sure how it got to them (or if it's even the exact same sword). &nbsp;But the sword</p><p>Haroun is new to me. &nbsp;He's a sickly Genasi Geomancer with a mix of Earth and Water. &nbsp;I'm not sure what he story is. &nbsp;He's lived a sheltered life, and seems to have sacrificed his heath to be a prophet. &nbsp;Arwel is acting as his guide and has been working to educate him about the world. &nbsp;I&nbsp;would love to get a chance to learn more, but he'll have to warm up to me first.</p><p>As we traveled, we managed to find a clue in the attack. &nbsp;We found the spot where a single orc expanded over and over again to form the army. &nbsp;I&nbsp;could tell that the effect came from the nearby techno-prophet city. </p><p>We were headed near that direction anyways, so we continued. &nbsp;Haroun proved to be a liability here though. &nbsp;He didn't want to go near the city, but it's not safe to leave people in the wilderness, and there really is no other place to go. &nbsp;Joseph tried to disguise him, but the rest of us provided our own little touches. &nbsp;He looked like a straight water genasi by the time we were done.</p><p>Our trip to the city provided a fun diversion. &nbsp;I wish I could have stayed longer. &nbsp;We stopped by a tavern by the entrance. &nbsp;Thankfully it was early, and not many people were around. &nbsp;I&nbsp;bought a few drinks for Haroun and Arwel while the rest of us left to take care of business.</p><p>Ed went to the library, while I&nbsp;took Kith and Joseph to the nexus. &nbsp;I&nbsp;studied the nexus for a few minutes to see that the affected orc did pass through the nexus, it didn't originate here. &nbsp;I was approached by a local geomancer mentioned that someone teleported into the city through the nexus on an errand around that time, and it was possible that the orc used that to piggyback passage. &nbsp;Not much is known about the person or the errand though.</p><p>An effect like this could only come from a very powerful geomancer, or group of geomancers. &nbsp;Seems like the source was further into the woods, but we couldn't tell more than that. &nbsp;Also, we had no idea who could have been involved in something like this. &nbsp;We discussed the idea that the current quakes are the result of the magics used in this assault, and given the power required, might be on the mark. &nbsp;But this kind of power is unprecedented, at least in my experience.</p><p>?? (not sure exactly how this played out (or if it matters))</p><p>We returned to the geomancer at the nexus with Arwel's sword. &nbsp;She explains that this was supposed to be it's ultimate destination, and they wanted to study it. &nbsp;(I wonder if they have caught wind of Iraja's prophesy?). </p><p>Haroun saw that someone was after the sword in the city. &nbsp;The geomancer graced us with a few enchantments (pass without trace) and we were out the door. &nbsp;We're to take the sword to Terminus. &nbsp;Yay... &nbsp;Since we need to stay hidden, it will take almost a year to get there. </p><p>Not long after, Haroun received a message that our destination has been compromised, and we are to just stay hidden and keep the sword safe. &nbsp;We change our plans and start heading towards an independent city bu the swamp. &nbsp;I haven't explored the swamp, so I am looking forward to this.</p><p>---- Questions</p><p>&nbsp;Who are we running from?</p><p>How did they know the sword was there?</p><p>How did they find out where we were going, and so quickly?</p><p>Why do the techo-prophets want the sword now? &nbsp;How long have they been looking for it?</p><p>What do they (the techno-prophets)&nbsp; want to do with it?</p><p>Are the techno-prophets dupes for a powerful geomancer, or are they connected to the army?</p><p>Who was on the errand, what was the errand, and is there any connection there?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 4</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I wish I&nbsp;could say that I&nbsp;had more answers, but all&nbsp;I&nbsp;really have is more questions. &nbsp;And Haroun is at the center of most of them. &nbsp;Trained geomancers are a force to be reckoned with. &nbsp;His ability to see not only into the vastness of the present, but the endless possibilities of the future is impressive. &nbsp;He was able to draw very accurate maps that covered more than a days travel in each direction each morning. &nbsp;This is a trick I need to learn.</p><p>He offered to divine what he could about questions we had. &nbsp;Others with us, including Kith and Joe took him up on his offer, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. &nbsp;I want to know how he did it, but such knowledge sucks the adventure out of life. &nbsp;He also told us we were all important. &nbsp;This coincides with what I've seen in each person's past. &nbsp;I&nbsp;wonder if he can see the past as well?</p><p>Haroun also experienced several prophesies while on our journey. &nbsp;One involved Isaline with a crow on her shoulder. &nbsp;Another involved a black dragonborn's head. &nbsp;Yet another involved a warforged with a hat smoking a cigar surrounded by buildings. </p><p>I&nbsp;think we ran into the warforged in the swamp. &nbsp;Haft was his name, and he was sent from Intenpestivus to return Haroun. &nbsp;Haroun didn't want to go, and we weren't about to give him up. &nbsp;Unfortunately, he was blocking our path through the swamp. &nbsp;Any alternate routes would have taken us hours, if not more to get around. </p><p>He had left a slew of crappy traps in our way. &nbsp;I&nbsp;had started disarming them, but he had cleverly hidden a really clever trap in their midst. &nbsp;I&nbsp;got snagged and dragged into the waters. &nbsp;Thankfully they get a knife to me and get me free. &nbsp;I'll need to be a little more careful in the future and not underestimate my foes.</p><p>The rest of the party managed to take him out, and I&nbsp;took care of the rest of the traps allowing us to continue our journey. &nbsp;Half was a weighed down with a little too much jewelry that we were happy to relieve him of. &nbsp;I&nbsp;swiped 4 rings of protection and 3 amulets of natural armor. &nbsp;And no, I will not be wearing them all at the same time, thank you.</p><p>&nbsp;While the best is yet to come, I&nbsp;am getting ahead of myself. &nbsp;Before we ventured into the swamp, we spent the evening in Freeport, a Gnollish settlement near the swamp. &nbsp;I hadn't been there before, but I don't know that I really care to go back. &nbsp;The Innkeeper was nice enough. &nbsp;Morden Brokenhorn he calls himself after slaying the previous minotaur owner. &nbsp;The food and the drinks were good, but something just didn't sit right with me.</p><p>On a tip, I&nbsp;went to find an herbalist to get some information about the swamp. &nbsp;They routinely gather herbs from the swamp. &nbsp;A few of them are rare and quite expensive. &nbsp;In exchange for talking to me, I&nbsp;promised to gather any rare &nbsp;herbs that I&nbsp;found. &nbsp;Even if I have to go back, it was worth it. &nbsp;They passed on a few survival tips, directions, and warned us of the hydras.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We rented six rooms, but consolidated down to a couple. &nbsp;Haft was in town looking for Haroun, and, by the looks of them, several members of the crowd looked willing to tip him off. &nbsp;Haroun(?) used a little magic to fix the roof outside our windows. &nbsp;This was as much to thank the innkeeper as it was to give us a possible escape route. &nbsp;Thankfully it wasn't needed. &nbsp;In the morning I&nbsp;had to spend most of my remaining money on a horse.</p><p>Back to the end of the swamp. &nbsp;Near the middle of the swamp we came across a dead hydra, another party of six, and an ebony fortress. &nbsp;I really want to see what's in the fortress, but there is a little resistance to that idea. &nbsp;I'm going to go try to resolve it once I&nbsp;get finished writing.</p><p>The other party includes Biger, Isaline and Sahrit as well as three people I haven't met. &nbsp;Za'har is a Deva swordsage. &nbsp;Rebin Noroelwa is a swashbuckler of questionable decent. &nbsp;The last member, Gwenvyth Trieleffyn Tal'Arabep is the one that intrigues me. &nbsp;She seems to have some Drow blood in her, and I&nbsp;wonder where she got it. &nbsp;She also has an air of nobility around her. &nbsp;A flicker of recognition graced her face when I was discussing the mutiplying orc. &nbsp;She matches the description of the "person on an errand", though when questions, she presented a fairly convincing denial. &nbsp;I'll have to be careful when talking to that one.</p><p>While waiting, Kith and I had discussed turning Biger crank. &nbsp;I'm not sure if we'd end up in the same place, or in range at all, so we decided to wait. &nbsp;I'll unlock it though, just so we have a wild card up our sleeve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 5</strong></p><p>"You wander where you wil", and "you have as many ends as there are paths". &nbsp;What rubbish. &nbsp;Well, both of those are true, in that obvious, night comes after day kinda way. &nbsp;But when seeing the great Priestess of the Black, hidden aware in her fortress, deep in the swamp, surrounded by treasures from the ages decides to give us a taste of her power, this is what she comes up with?</p><p>When I&nbsp;received my private audience, I&nbsp;asked to know a little more about the guild I joined up with. &nbsp;I figured this was a good test. &nbsp;After a momentary trace, she mentioned that they were dangerous, and that they sought control. &nbsp;Again, nothing I&nbsp;didn't know already. &nbsp;The surprising thing was how she was left shaken and instructed that I&nbsp;never ask about them of her again.</p><p>Sure, most of the others had questions, and most of them seemed to get better answers, but from what I&nbsp;heard, most of the questions were about the past or the present. &nbsp;In that respect, her ability to know things is impressive (if, indeed, she did actually know these things), but she may just have an impressive list of informants. &nbsp;After all, our travels could have easily drawn some attention. </p><p>Like I said, most of the others seemed to overvalue her advise. &nbsp; Arwel gave her the sword. &nbsp;I'm not sure if this was a good idea or not, but I'm not sure that I care. &nbsp;I'm just glad to be rid of it. &nbsp;I'm glad it led us here, and it was quite the journey, but it's time for the next adventure. &nbsp;At least we didn't give into her interest in Haroun.</p><p>Speaking of adventures, half of the people there got roped into a fools mission of killing the king of the front giants. &nbsp;Our lovely seer helped teleport them there, but then they were to seek advice of another seer, without revealing the involvement of the current one. &nbsp;What kind of game is she up to? &nbsp;I'm just glad to have no part in it.</p><p>She was also after Sahrit's knowledge of the ritual to extract the heart of a nexus. &nbsp;I'm not sure where he learned that trick, or how she does not, but if she doesn't, I&nbsp;don't really want her to find out. &nbsp;Sahrit seemed like he was going to tell her, so Ktih and I&nbsp;did the only thing we could to stop him. &nbsp;I had already unlocked the crank, and left the turning to Kith. &nbsp;Unfortunately, he didn't turn it. &nbsp;He was promised by Pelor's avatar that she would forget again by morning. &nbsp;I sincerely hope that's the case, though I am saddened that I still don't know first hand what that crank does.</p><p>Pelor was there, though I'm not entirely sure why. &nbsp;He seemed content to mostly observe. &nbsp;That may be the most intrieging mystery of the evening, but I&nbsp;didn't talk with him, so I&nbsp;don't have much of an answer.</p><p>There were a dozen of us in all, including a few I&nbsp;had not met. &nbsp;Of these, Gwenvyth is by far the most interesting. &nbsp;She's a half drow noble from Arx. &nbsp;She's pretty, and she can talk the talk, but she's also the one who was involved with trasporting the orc. &nbsp;I'm not sure what her involvement was exactly, or her motivations, but she was involved.</p><p>She's on a quest to learn of her heritage, and wants to find the city of the Drow &lt;filll in name here&gt;. &nbsp;The seeker couldn't tell her where to find it (what limitations..), but I left there right before this journey started. &nbsp;I&nbsp;hope I&nbsp;can use this to get her to follow along on my quest to find the grove.</p><p>The seer did have something to say on that grove. &nbsp;First, she wants to know where it is, and was bargining with others to tell her if we found it. &nbsp;(I just hate the idea of giving her any information she doesn't already have. &nbsp;Maybe all this wheeling and dealing is how she "sees" things?). &nbsp;Second, that she used to live there. &nbsp;And thirdly, we can get there following the river northwest of &lt;town name here&gt;.</p><p>We could also meet up with an ally there, which interests me, but that is also Haroun's home. &nbsp;After fleeing and hiding, I doubt anything would convince him to return.</p><p>Now, my path is clear, to gather up those that weren't foolish enough to chase the frost giant king, and hope they are fooling enough to seek the grove deep in the wilds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 6</strong></p><p>I love to meet people. &nbsp;I love to wonder around, talk to people on the street or in taverns. &nbsp;I get a kick of sneaking around, pilfering a little excess here and there, or rubbing elbows with self-important nobles. &nbsp;However, I&nbsp;hate dealing with people who have real power.</p><p>I&nbsp;always feel like they're the ones holding all the cards. &nbsp;It's hard to tell where they are coming from, or what they're really after. &nbsp;Their public persona never quite match their words.</p><p>Take Mordelwen, the Priestess of the Black, for example. &nbsp;She seems to have conned my traveling companions into doing various deeds for her, like killing the Front Giant King, or reporting back the location of the grove I seek. &nbsp;She has given out visions and items to aid our journey, but I have no intention of telling her anything, and I refuse to be in her debt.</p><p>Beyond that, before we left, I&nbsp;saw a few more strange visions. &nbsp;I&nbsp;saw her clawing at the handprint on Sahrit. &nbsp;I saw her digging her claws into Haroun, and &lt;insert one more here&gt;. &nbsp;While all of my visions to date have been about past events, I'm not so sure about these. &nbsp;They felt a little more like a premonition or maybe an intention. &nbsp;I should ask Haroun to see if he can help make sense of them.</p><p>Then we have Vartarra, the head geomancer. &nbsp;He happens to be in town at the same time as the nexus is experiencing a strange and erratic pulsing that continuously flooded the city with energy. &nbsp;We could feel this even before we entered the city. &nbsp;It even caused Sahrit to explode with inverted energy. &nbsp;But I'll get to that later.</p><p>We met Vartarra after battling creatures that emerged from the nexus. &nbsp;(I'll get to that later too). &nbsp;He has some form of protection against my visions, so I&nbsp;can't get a read on his past. &nbsp;He also used some arcane powers to try to protect the nexus.</p><p>But the most troubling of all is that to "fix" the nexus, he ended up inverting it. &nbsp;As far as I&nbsp;know, the underworld is suffering because inverted nexuses aren't stable and eventually collapse. &nbsp;I'm not aware of any way to flip them back.</p><p>Also, he seemed unaware of our previous battle with creatures that emerged from the nexus. &nbsp;Something we reported months ago, and I&nbsp;would have assumed he would have known.</p><p>He also wants us to find the grove in the wilderness. &nbsp;He's working with magistrate, my superior in guild. &nbsp;I'm not sure what the relationship is, what Vartarra's goal is, or how he knowns of the grove.</p><p>Speaking of the magistrate. &nbsp;He's in Terminus with us, and he has an airship that the technoprphets are repairing. &nbsp;It's the same ship that Ed had crashed on the other side of the wastes. &nbsp;Not sure how he found it, or how they got it here, but here it is.</p><p>He claims that he wants to find the grove to prevent a war between the empire and the technoprophets, but, if that were true, why would he have hired the emperor's assassin? &nbsp;Kith doesn't trust him, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;can't say that I&nbsp;do, though I'll have to play along. &nbsp;One thing is certain, and that is adventure will follow where he leads.</p><p>This brings me to Kith. &nbsp;He stuck with me for most of the day, however, I'm not sure how he's going to react to my use of the inverted nexus. &nbsp;Also, an old "friend" of his just showed up in the inverted nexus proclaiming "We have come to serve you in the coming days".</p><p>This "friend" is a powerful satyr that had Kith caged up at some point in the past. &nbsp;There was a crack in his lens associated with Kith's escape, so I&nbsp;don't know exactly what happened, but I&nbsp;would never bring this up to Kith. &nbsp;He brought a small guard of demons with him.</p><p>I don't know who he's talking to. &nbsp;It could be Vartarra, Sahrit, the woman from the Fochluchan incident where I&nbsp;saw her die. &nbsp;It could be Gwen or the Magistrate (who knows what kind of friends he has). &nbsp;I&nbsp;doubt that it's Kith, or me, or the guards, and I'm not aware of any other likely person around. &nbsp;I'll just have to grab Kith and get out of there as soon as I&nbsp;can.</p><p>I was trying to make inroads with Sahrit and Gwen by waiting for them in the inverted nexus. &nbsp;They seem to be on the same page, and I'm having trouble getting involved. &nbsp;They both require inverted energy, and were caused pain by the pulsing nexus. &nbsp;I&nbsp;should try to stay closer to them, but there's so many other things I&nbsp;need to do and to see.</p><p>Before entering town, I&nbsp;helped disguise Gwen and Haroun. &nbsp;Kith and I tried to keep Vartarra's attention on ourselves and off the rest of the party. &nbsp;We always went to him, and we stayed with at the geomancer's guild instead of at the tavern. &nbsp;Arwel tagged along sometimes (and tried to convince the head engineer to travel with us on the airship), but she ultimately stayed with the rest of the party.</p><p>Thankfully Arwel was with us on our initial nexus visit when we were attacked. &nbsp;Several of the creatures had the ability to infect others with their taint, and one even managed to hit me. &nbsp;Thankfully, with a little concentration, I&nbsp;was able to purge myself. &nbsp;At least one of the guards wasn't so lucky. &nbsp;I&nbsp;really hate large battles with lots of ugly creatures. &nbsp;I much prefer getting the jump on a single opponent.</p><p>So, here we are, gathered in or near the inverted nexus. &nbsp;Sahrit and Gwen are inside with me, along with the satyr and his guard. &nbsp;Kith and the others are outside, though I'm not sure exactly sure where. &nbsp;I'm curious as to the meaning of the satyr's words, and how he came to be here, but my top priority is to find Kith and get him away from here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 7</strong></p><p>Kith, Kith, Kith, Kith, Kith... &nbsp;What does it all mean?</p><p>I've spent most of my short life within the bounds of the Empire. &nbsp;I knew little of withering, little of nexuses, and nothing of geomancy. &nbsp;I have since expanded my horizons considerably. &nbsp;I have discovered nexuses, geomancy, many other cultures, and many other wonders. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have been places most people haven't even heard of. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have experienced "normal" and inverted nexuses. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have seen the plight of the cursed people who must rely on inverted nexuses because of their instability.. but this...</p><p>While I&nbsp;am quite young, it was my impression that the world has always been this way. &nbsp;The existence of humans has been a puzzle, but one that I&nbsp;just had in the back of my mind. &nbsp;There is definitely a lot of the world I have yet not seen, so it was easy to believe that they are from someplace I&nbsp;just hadn't been. &nbsp;Possibly some place beyond the wilds.</p><p>But something alway stuck out as odd, and that is the lack of nexuses. &nbsp;The empire functions in spite of the nexuses, but they are still there. &nbsp;But now Kith tells me that he is from a time without nexuses as well. &nbsp;I also learned he is quite old, though I'm not exactly sure how old.</p><p>Does that mean that humans are from an earlier time? &nbsp;I've seen small amounts of timeshifting with quakes before, but this is an entirely different scale. &nbsp;Also, if there were a time before nexuses, how did they come to be? &nbsp;So many questions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We also talked about current events. &nbsp;Kith had not heard about the prophesy about the upcoming calamity. &nbsp;I'm starting to wonder if it's going to be a self-fulfilling prophesy. &nbsp;The empire is trying to step up it's efforts to eliminate nexuses. &nbsp;The techo-prophets are taxing their nexuses past the point of stability (even going so far as to invert one of them). &nbsp;The appearance of the satyr can't be good. &nbsp;I&nbsp;don't know what he wants, but I&nbsp;doubt I'd like it.</p><p>Now we have rejoined our companions on the airship and are traveling into wilds unknown. &nbsp;I&nbsp;teleported Kith and I onto the ship from our hiding place near the edge of the feywood. &nbsp;I&nbsp;had successfully contacted Harun through a dream by finding a nexus. &nbsp;I&nbsp;told him we were okay, and that we'd meet up with them after they were on their way. &nbsp;I&nbsp;didn't get to learn much from him because Sahrit invaded the dream, and mentioned we were being watched.</p><p>Harun's dream scape was interesting (need to get reminder from Kelsey)...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;managed to slide out of the nexus once the satyr showed up and find Kith... &nbsp;well, allow Kith to find me would be more accurate. &nbsp;I wasn't intending to go quite as far as we did, only to the tavern or something, but Kith wanted to get as far away as possible. &nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn't quite pull off going to the other end of the world, so I&nbsp;teleported us north to about a day away from the wilds to hide out. &nbsp;I still need to find out what happened after we left.</p><p>On a side note, tree striding is fun. &nbsp;With a day's worth of downtime, I&nbsp;had time to contemplate just how fast I&nbsp;can get around. &nbsp;The world is a large place, but between tree strides and teleports, I&nbsp;can cover weeks of travel in a day or two.... &nbsp;I just need to keep this in mind.</p><p>Now to find out what happened to the rest of the party..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 8</strong></p><p>Kith, Kith, Kith.... &nbsp;where are you now? &nbsp;If the person swapping is consistent, then you are in the empire. &nbsp;I worry for you, though I doubt there is much need. &nbsp;You have survived this long well enough. &nbsp;I have seen what you can do, though I have also seen you vulnerable, so I worry.</p><p>...</p><p>There are dangers all around us. &nbsp;Quakes keep shifting people around. &nbsp;We were attacked by dragons in the air, rust monsters (or so Biger called them) on the ground, surrounded by Echidnox (or so Wrin identified them) and lead to their village. &nbsp;On our leisurely, friendly walk there, we were chased by something.. &nbsp;well, something colossally huge and terrifying!</p><p>Even with all of that, I&nbsp;still feel safer here than I would back in the "known" world. &nbsp;Graz'zt, despite being a satyr (or maybe because of), is quite the statesman. &nbsp;Apparently, he talked the technoprophets into war with the Empire (with the help of his minions). &nbsp;According to Ed, no one stopped to ask what Graz'zt got out of the deal. &nbsp;They probably assumed he was their servant, when the roles are really reversed. &nbsp;Then when Biger rejoined us, he confirmed that demons were attacking the empire. &nbsp;Yeah, glad I'm not there....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen it, seen the tower that I'm looking for. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the airship gave out before we could get too close. &nbsp;In the end, we managed to get it up and running again, and sent the engineer back the way we came.</p><p>&nbsp;The world itself seems to want to keep us away. &nbsp;I doubt it's us specifically, but everyone. &nbsp;Even the Echidnox don't want us to proceed.&nbsp; They are taking us to their village so that their chief can dissuade us. &nbsp;I don't see that happening, but I am curious about what he has to say. &nbsp;This just makes me more curious about what's in that tower and what it's history is. &nbsp;With all this resistance, I wonder if any of these grievous sins that I'm going to commit will happen here.</p><p>How can something out here have such an impact on the rest of the world? &nbsp;I can't help but think about what Haroun was saying about the gods, that they are merely reflections of the true power of prophesy. &nbsp;Now, I'm not a big fan of the gods. &nbsp;Some of them enabled the stifling empire to exist as it does. &nbsp;Pelor told me that I was going to do horrible things, but did nothing to stop it. &nbsp;But I don't know that prophesy is the best name for this power. &nbsp;Maybe this power lives out here. &nbsp;If it really is the power of prophesy, I don't know that I really want much to do with it. </p><p>Sure, I was lead here by a prophesy, but I have to wonder if I would be here without it. &nbsp;I doubt I would know Kith, or have heard his tales if I didn't try to befriend him to aid in this quest. &nbsp;But there are others looking for this spot as well (including that black priestess). &nbsp;Looking back, I think I would have ended up out here either way. &nbsp;It's not like I haven't ended up in other places unknown. </p><p>The black priestess said that&nbsp;"you have as many ends as there are paths", but it feels inevitable that I&nbsp;would end up here. &nbsp;How could my future be so open ended, and be subject to Pelor's prophesy? &nbsp;Maybe all paths lead here? &nbsp;Can that even be true? </p><p>Maybe someone is manipulating things. &nbsp;These strange quakes that keep flipping people between two groups are looking less and less random all the time. &nbsp;I&nbsp;haven't been taken by one yet, though I&nbsp;suspect that it's only a matter of time. &nbsp;I haven't spent a lot of time in civilization since this has started, but I haven't heard of this kind of thing happening anywhere else. &nbsp;I&nbsp;know Sahrit is involved somehow, and I'm guessing his father is too, but that can't be all there is too it. &nbsp;Sahrit has too many gaps in his knowledge to be able to orchestrate this, or to have a purpose. </p><p>Speaking of, I don't really know the purpose of whatever could be orchestrating this. &nbsp;I hope it's all random, and there is no power or plan behind it, but I suspect that's not the case. &nbsp;I would guess that this has to do with the prophesy of the calamity. &nbsp;I hope that tower holds some answers to these questions. &nbsp;And I hope I like the answers. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'll have to let Iraja know that we've nearly made it there. &nbsp;I can only hope that she's learned a few things in the mean time that can help shed some light on this. &nbsp;I'll also have to see what she knows about this calamity.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help but think that it will be a self-fulfilling prophesy.</p><p>Damn that priestess and her worthless mutterings. &nbsp;Damn Pelor and his "prophesy" about my future. &nbsp;Damn Haroun and his musings on the gods. &nbsp;Here I&nbsp;am, deep in the wilds, running for my life, trying to get to where no one has been for at least quite a while, and I'm thinking about these abstract ideas, when I&nbsp;need to be living in, and enjoying the moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 9</strong></p><p>Whew, we made it inside the village. &nbsp;For being nestled in such a dangerous place, the village was quite pleasant. &nbsp;We were paraded to meet their Elder, Bolero. &nbsp;He was busy mediating at the time, but allowed us to interrupt. &nbsp;They were all quite welcoming, and happy to share with us their stories. &nbsp;They even held a feast in our honor that evening.</p><p>But even more surprising, at least to me, is that they let us leave. &nbsp;Thousands of years ago, their ancestors were charged with protecting the tower by the gods. &nbsp;They tried to talk us out of going, telling us that the new guardian would surely kill us, and that we were unlikely to be able to enter, even if we did make it there.</p><p>This new guardian is an older, larger, and much more powerful version of the creature that chased us into the village. &nbsp;They had sent many parties to try and fight it, or even sneak past it to get to the tower, but it always found them, and few, if any, lived to return.</p><p>The Echidnox don't live alone in this village. &nbsp;They are joined by a few Oni. &nbsp;The Oni are powerfully built, red skinned creatures with horns. &nbsp;They don't look like something I'd like to cross. &nbsp;This is only confirmed after watching them help defend the walls in the present and in the past.</p><p>The Echidnox also keep pets. &nbsp;Bolero has a pet caterpillar. &nbsp;In other areas we see that people have kept smaller rust monsters as pets. &nbsp;A few Echidnox even ask us if our "junk" is meant for food for their pets.</p><p>Everything they use is wood. &nbsp;They have manipulated the ley lines that crisscross the village so that they can manipulate the forest around them. &nbsp;The walls around the city can shift to impale assailants, or open to let us through. </p><p>They have formed different shapes with the ley lines. &nbsp;Apparently different shapes have different effects. &nbsp;Triangles are supposed to be good, and I&nbsp;did see them everywhere. &nbsp;Squares are supposed to be bad, but I&nbsp;don't understand why. &nbsp;Whatever the reason, they are able to continually refresh without a nexus present. &nbsp;Nexuses are a liability out here, as they attract all sorts of monsters.</p><p>Originally, the Echidnox, the Oni, and the Platipods were nomads, all working to protect Arcadia. &nbsp;Then the Tarrasque appeared. &nbsp;Their leader at the time (the Vanquisher, an Oni), decided they needed to defeat the Tarrasque to defend Arcadia. &nbsp;"The Battle of Sorrows". </p><p>Many died in the fight, and the Tarrasque remained. &nbsp;The platapods lost faith in the charge and returned to their nomadic ways, while the Echidnox continued to defend Arcadia. &nbsp;The Oni were split, and The Vanquisher left in shame, having vanquished his own people.</p><p>I tried to contact Iraja, but something was blocking me. &nbsp;I&nbsp;just wanted to let her know that I&nbsp;was close, and would be approaching the tower in the morning.</p><p>I&nbsp;was sorry to go, but there was a tower to explore. &nbsp;The first matter at hand was how to get there. &nbsp;We discussed trying to fly, but the airship didn't seem like it could get close enough. &nbsp;We also considered flying steeds, though they are much slower, and could leave us exposed to attack.</p><p>I&nbsp;scouted the area by jumping from tree to tree. &nbsp;I&nbsp;can go further in these trees than I could in the fey wood. &nbsp;I&nbsp;should be able to go fast enough to avoid the Tarrasque as long as I&nbsp;don't just come upon him. </p><p>We decided that I&nbsp;would treestride to the tower, carrying everyone else cramped into a portable hole. &nbsp;It looked a little cramped in their, and everyone had to hold their breath. &nbsp;I decided to try to make the trip a little faster by simply teleporting there.</p><p>It's a good thing I did, as I was transfixed by the tower. &nbsp;I&nbsp;see ley lines coming out of the water and climbing up the tower. </p><p>Then I&nbsp;see a vision of the tower that feels ancient. &nbsp;I&nbsp;see a dark haired human woman in purple armor at the base of the spire. &nbsp;She's covered in bruises, but looks very determined. &nbsp;She flies up past the clouds, above the ring. &nbsp;All the ley lines are bound to the ring.</p><p>She hovers there for a moment and smiles. &nbsp;She then begins to draw in energy. &nbsp;Her head leans back and feathery wings sprout from her back. </p><p>The vision moves on, but now there are 2 of her, but floating there, channeling energy when a quake occurs. &nbsp;Then there is one. &nbsp;She then looks around, gestures, and a portal appear in the ring and she dives through it. &nbsp;Then the tower begins to shake, then collapse. &nbsp;The ley lines became as chains and choked it apart. &nbsp;The ring also descends, and the portal disappears as it reaches the ground.</p><p>It seems like there is more, but it is blocked, though the block feels familiar....</p><p>I&nbsp;see a little more. &nbsp;18 people in a large circle. &nbsp;They are far apart, but look joined. &nbsp;Together they invoke power magic that causes the ley lines to tie back into the ring and reform it. &nbsp;&lt;what is it? &nbsp;The ring, the tower?&gt;</p><p>The vision ends, and I&nbsp;can no longer see. &nbsp;I&nbsp;can hear the Tarrasque though, so I don't have a lot of time. &nbsp;I open the portable hole, and trade places with someone else. &nbsp;It ended up being Sahrit. &nbsp;This confused me, as he wasn't with us when we left the village. &nbsp;Apparently another quake happened during my vision.</p><p>Sahrit gets us to the door, and he, along with Cameron open the door and we go in just in time to avoid a blast of energy from the Tarrasque. </p><p>&nbsp;I manage to gather enough energy to heal my blindness. &nbsp;We are in a huge room with 20 alcoves and a few corpses. &nbsp;The corpses are from half a dozen or so devils. &nbsp;They are fairly chopped up, so it's hard to tell. &nbsp;They look fresh, but I have no idea of how time works in here, so I&nbsp;don't know when this really happened. &nbsp;If they are truly fresh, then I&nbsp;have to wonder who did this? &nbsp;The answer to that, I can't even imagine.</p><p>18 of the Alcoves have shrines to gods, though not every god is represented. &nbsp;Arwel is annoyed that Cuthburt isn't represented and builds her own shrine in a corner. &nbsp;This place feels important, though I don't put much stock in the gods, so I can't say that I am horribly interested. </p><p>The 18 probably relate to the 18 in the circle in my vision. &nbsp;Did that act make them gods, or were they gods before that?</p><p>One of the empty alcoves had a door that we couldn't seem to open. &nbsp;Maybe it only opened from the other side. &nbsp;The other had a staircase that led down into the real treasure of the tower. &nbsp;There was a giant room with a projection of all the nexus in the world. &nbsp;It also shows the state of each nexus, normal, inverted, or collapsed. &nbsp;It also confirmed that the world is a ball.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&nbsp;couldn't find separate nexuses for the underdark. &nbsp;But it's unlikely that this map would be missing them. &nbsp;Also, it's strange but the nexuses in the empire are inverted, where I&nbsp;would have assumed that they would have been collapsed. </p><p>I knew that there was some tie between the empire and the underdark, but I&nbsp;never thought it was tied through the nexuses. &nbsp;I&nbsp;can't even begin to imagine what this means. &nbsp;I'm sure Cameron has something to do with it though. &nbsp;At least now, I don't know about the past.</p><p>Does this mean that the empire is inverting nexuses for the sake of &nbsp;the underworld? &nbsp;If so, who knows about it. &nbsp;That's definitely not the party line. &nbsp;Maybe no one is to use them because they are inverted. &nbsp;But what does this have to do with their deal with the gods?</p><p>Do they really have a deal with the gods, or is this a deal with the devil? &nbsp;It's hard to deny that there is some sort of deal. &nbsp;People don't wither, and goemancy is smothered in their boarders. &nbsp;What other than the gods could cause that? </p><p>If the gods are behind it, is it really the good gods? &nbsp;Sure, there is some benefit to those in the empire, but there is also benefit to those below. &nbsp;But then again, if they could prevent withering in the empire, couldn't they do it for those in the underdark as well? &nbsp;Or is that part of their curse?</p><p>I should have paid more attention to their history when I&nbsp;was down there. &nbsp;I'll have to make another trip soon to find out more. &nbsp;I&nbsp;need to find out how they got cursed. &nbsp;I also need to find out how they are tied to the empire. &nbsp;The empire may have some answers for me as well, but honestly, I'd rather go to the underdark than back to the empire.</p><p>I&nbsp;don't know what to make of this world. &nbsp;I&nbsp;thought by exploring it I&nbsp;would understand it, and understand myself better. &nbsp;But with everyplace I go, I&nbsp;seem to understand it less and less.</p><p>And what about my vision? &nbsp;Who was the human lady in the purple armor. &nbsp;How did she grow wings? &nbsp;Why did she look beaten up? &nbsp;Where did that portal lead to? &nbsp;If that was really eons ago, and there were ley lines, how old does that make Kith? &nbsp;Or did they happen in different histories? &nbsp;What about the humans that came from places without nexuses? &nbsp;Or those that did?</p><p>For that matter, where did they come from? &nbsp;What caused them to be? &nbsp;Were there quakes before they existed, or are quakes and nexuses linked?</p><p>I&nbsp;tried to contact Iraja again. &nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn't contact her directly, though hopefully next time she sleeps she will learn that I was close. &nbsp;Maybe I'll try again tonight.</p><p>We heard a noise and all rush upstairs. &nbsp;The doors crash open. &nbsp;Vance is there and says "Son.. I've been looking for you EVERYWHERE."</p><p>What is he doing here? &nbsp;I've never met the man, and I've only seen him in Sahrit's past. &nbsp;Though I'm guessing he was our visitor when I was in Haroun's dream. &nbsp;I don't know what he's doing here, but I'm doubting that I'll like it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 10</strong></p><p><br />So much for that idea.  I can be manipulated by the whims of fate.  So much for anything that old hag told me having any meaning beyond the obvious.  <br /><br />All of a sudden I find my self with “the other group” in the Empire.  They are holed up with some guy named Dragontamer, spending a week preparing to assault the Marquis Von Wagram.  Kith was with them, though we didn’t take much time to talk.<br /><br />Since we were in the empire, I figured it was a good time to not be me.  I donned my dragonborn alter-ego for the duration of my visit.  I hope my crimes now pale in comparison to the current events, but the empire isn’t know for it’s sense of perspective.<br /><br />Lyra Dragontamer goes missing early in the week.  Haroun attempts to use prophesy to gain insight in the marquis and his fortress.  In the end, we opted for the always classic play of sneaking in the side door and rushing him.  Interestingly enough, we weren’t the only ones with this grand plan.  Three members of another group joined us in the Marquis’s throne room.  This group consisted of Za’har, who I had seen in the old hag’s fortress.  Naxk, whom I haven’t seen since I left the underworld was also with them.  Vashir rounded out the group.  He was a warrior that helped keep the monsters away from the underworld cities.  <br /><br />To make a short story shorter, we beat him up a bit, he turned into mist and fled underground.  We followed, fought a literal wall of undead, and found his coffin hiding in an inverted nexus.  We let Isaline have the honors.  <br /><br />Za’har and Naxk planned to replace the Marquis with Vashir.  I can’t say that I really care.  All I’ve learned is that the empire is a much more confused and chaotic place that I had imagined.<br /><br />I do wonder how Za’har, Naxk, and Vashir got involved.  I could only guess that the magistrate, or his organization, is behind their involvement.  What could they have in store for me, now that I brought the magistrate to the tower?<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Between Chapters 1 and 2</span></strong><br /><br /><strong>Entry 1:</strong><br /><br />Enough of this “Empire”.  I can’t take it any more.  Before it was just stifling.  Now it stifling, chaotic, and threatened.  Not a good combination for free spirits like me.<br /><br />Maybe whatever it is that’s quaking us around like fools wanted me away from Vance, maybe it wanted me away from the tower, maybe it was bored and just wanted to screw with me.  I don’t know, but I feel the need to go back.  I need find out what happened.  I need to find out what that place is for.<br /><br />I took a moment to wish Kith well, say that I’m needed elsewhere, and I took off.  Unfortunately, the trees away from the wilds don’t travel quite as well.  I’ve survived out on my own in the wastes, so scrounging up enough to sustain myself wasn’t too hard.  It took a few days to get there, though I couldn’t keep count.  <br /><br />It’s hard to not appreciate how big the world actually is when trying to cross it in a hurry.  Round worlds do have their advantages though.  Terminus is really out of my way, and from what Ed said before, probably run by the Satyr by now.  As long as I’m heading away from the wastes, I must be heading towards the tower.<br /><br />I am able to teleport into the tower, and thankfully, not everyone has left.  Ed’s presence doesn’t surprise me.  I didn’t expect to see Biger, and I really didn’t expect Admatha to be there.  She was wearing new skin this time.<br /><br />I told them about what happened to me in the empire.  We took down an ally of the destroyer of nexuses.  In return they filled me in on what happened here.  They didn’t want to tell me everything, but it was recent and significant enough, that I could read it in their pasts.  <br /><br />Now I’m even more curious about Biger’s second crank.  It seemed like they knew about one of them, though I’m not sure which.  They didn’t know who built Ed either, so I’m guessing the same “person” is responsible for each.  I do wonder who that is.<br /><br />Wrin is also far more interesting now.  Before he exhibited knowledge about the creature near the tower, and now he knows about the gods, and may have been commenting on their statements.  I wonder if he has the same constructor as well?<br /><br />Before I get too far into what I learned, I should say that the three of them have decided to travel around giving aid and healing to many of the injured that are sure to flow from the coming war.  I wish them luck, but that sounds incredibly boring to me.  I have many other more pressing questions to answer.<br /><br />Vance’s appearance wasn’t even the evening’s headliner, but it was a good opening act.  Along with Vance, three other people entered the room, though they entered from the other door that we couldn’t open.  I’m glad to see Iraja made it here, and with her are Kumo and Admatha.  Things seemed very confused, but they seem to be here to help Vance capture half of Sahrit.    <br /><br />I saw that Sahrit has 2 pasts, it makes sense that he has two halves in the present.  It’s not clear to me if or how involved he has been with inverting nexuses in the Empire.  He was with us in Terminus when the nexus inverted, but I don’t remember him being directly involved.  I wanted to use my ability to refresh at an inverted nexus to gain some favor with him, but the Satyr put an end to those plans.<br /><br />After some negotating with the party, and especially with Arwel (bless her innocent soul), Vance places his hand on Sahrit’s shoulder and sucks a soul into the gem he keeps in his eye socket.  Iraja doesn’t trust Vance with the gem, and seems to want to make sure that the soul doesn’t suffer needlessly.  She ends up traveling with Vance.  She must have some interesting stories to tell.  I’ll need to find her at some point to get her take on all of this.  I’m guessing she’ll have a unique perspective on things.<br /><br />Joseph and Vance try to work out some kind of agreement, but Ann appears and intercedes.  She doesn’t like Vance at all, and won’t allow Joseph to have anything to do with him.  Vance seems to think she’s tied to the Raven Queen, though this is news to Joseph, and he doesn’t seem to know how to take it.  Vance warns Joseph that he will need to kill him next time they meet.<br /><br />I really don’t know what to think of Vance, or Sahrit at this point.  They both seem to be strong characters with their own agenda.  I don’t agree with what Sahrit was trying to do, but he had more power than knowledge.  Vance, though..  I want to believe that Vance knows a lot more about what’s going on than he lets on, or that we know.  <br /><br />The defining moment in Sahrit’s past seemed to be the moment that Vance either did or did not channel energy into Sahrit’s mother.  Sahrit, both havles, are his creation.  His research and knowledge gave them power to purify, invert, or destroy nexuses.  He also kept Sarhit in the dark about many of the details about how the world works.  I pray for his captured soul, and it is really just a product of Vance’s design.  He must have become too willful on his own, or rejected Vance too strongly to continue to be manipulated.  But to what end?  What is Vance’s goal?  I still don’t know.<br /><br />As for the main act...  The gods themselves came down to visit the party.  Not all of them, but a fair number.  If Wrin’s light is any indication, they weren’t completely honest about their intentions or relations, but their message is simple.  They wish to ween the world off of nexus energy and provide protection from withering themselves.  <br /><br />They do have a point in that a lot of the conflict between nations has to do with the nexuses.  The techno-prophets want to control as many nexuses as possible, the empire to destroy them, the underworld to invert them, and nomads get left fighting for scraps.<br /><br />This plan sounds a little too much like the empire to me.  I’ve lived there, and while it has appeared peaceful from the inside, another word for it would be sterile.  I just took part in the assassination of a Marquis.  Measures like that shouldn’t be necessary if the empire were truly peaceful.  Remove this reason for war, and they will find another.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I still must head there advice.  It was just to keep an open mind.  I’m sure they want more, but I don’t know what.  I also don’t know what the goals of those gods not present are.  I generally don’t really care about the gods.  I prefer to walk my own path.  The only major involvement I have seen them have is the empire.  Oh, and of course the bargain that cursed those in the underworld.  If it weren’t for the gods, would the conflict over the nexuses even exist?  I’d rather get rid of the gods than the nexuses.<br /><br />After everyone left the tower, I needed to see what other trouble I could get into.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t much.  I know I saw the tower’s destruction in a vision, but did that actually happen in this time line?  Or did that happen in another history?  I wish I could see more of that vision, or more of the world in which that vision took place.  I may have seen hints of hit in Joseph’s past, but nothing to tell me anything useful.  Kith is also from a time before the nexuses.  Did people wither then, or did the gods’ power prevent it then as it does now in the empire?  Did the gods place some of their power into the nexuses, and thereby lose the power to control withering?  And now they want it back?  I must try to ask Kith about the time when the nexuses appeared.<br /><br />I want desperately to climb to the top of the tower, but I can’t seem to find a way up.  I could teleport up there, but then how would I get down?  I don’t dare with the guardian about.  I’ll have to return at another time.<br /><br /><strong>Entry 2</strong><br /><br />Onward and downward from the tower.  Ed said something about being able to use the map to travel.  Before I go, I need to find a way to blend in.  I’m not scared of getting recognized so much as not being recognized.  If things are half as crazy as I imagine, I surface dweller isn’t likely to be on the guest list.  I don’t want to attract attention, but I do want to have a little fun.  This persona will be a male drow named Sigmund.  <br /><br />Sigmund will be smaller than average, though a skilled marksman.  He’s a remnant from a long fallen house, so has no standing.  Most people wouldn’t give him a second notice.  If anyone asks, he’s a messenger, but doesn’t really hold down a job.  I was a messenger down there, so I’m fairly  certain I can make that stick.<br /><br />After a few more days, I think I have the map figured out, and mange to use it to send myself near the nexus to &lt;insert underworld city name here&gt;.  I make myself invisible for the transfer, and once it’s done, I quickly try to find a place I can safely appear.  <br /><br />Things are definitely different than I remember.  They had a hard lot, but had learned to work with it.  Now there is much more tension and fear.  The empire hasn’t been holding up it’s end of the bargain, and nexuses have been collapsing before their time.  Rumors abound.  No body knows if this is intentional or not, and if so, if it’s the new emperor, or if it’s someone else.  It could be the vanquisher, it could be the gods coming to extract their final payment, it could be the work of necromancers that have been reported recently.  Who knows.  All they know is that they’re scared and somewhat powerless.<br /><br />The leadership is trying to keep things calm, and to use their contacts to find answers, but for a people who are used to fighting for survival, waiting while others determine their fate doesn’t sit well.<br /><br />Many groups have started forming to take matters into their own hands.  Small groups of warriors break off from the monster patrols and venture topside.  Some try to attack anything they see, others try to sneak in and learn what they can.<br /><br />I stayed out of this at first.  I don’t care to return to the empire, especially looking like a drow.  I knew a little of what’s going on up there, but my voice shouldn’t be heard over the noise, and I didn’t want to draw attention to myself.<br /><br />The little ring on my finger did enough of that for me.  I managed to keep my head down for about a month, but that’s all that even I could manage.  Someone was on to me, and they were very good in that I could never identify who.  After a week of this, I returned home to find someone waiting for me.  <br /><br />Her name is Torialla.  She’s actually a priestess of Lloth, but from a low ranking house.  Her story is that  her family had no one else it could trust for intel, so she was chosen to join the patrols a few months ago.  The ring on her finger told a slightly different story.  It also explained her appearance.  The last time they asked me to do something, it lead to a grand adventure, so who am I to refuse, even if it’s against my better judgement.<br /><br />I joined the guards and mysteriously enough was assigned to the same unit as Torialla.  The first few times out, we stuck with the main unit.  I guess I still needed to prove myself.  I’m a pretty good shot with a longbow, and proved that I can contribute. <br /><br />The veterans really complain about all the new recruits.  They need them, so they can’t say no, but half of them aren’t really there to fight monsters, and the other half is too green and skittish to be of much use.  While I’m hardly a battle hardened vet, I did impress them with my ability to actually follow orders, keep my head, and hit something every now and again.<br /><br />Only after a month of daily fighting was I welcomed into Torialla’s raiding party.  Two other members of the unit were part of her group.  A dark dwarf called Gruff.  I never found out if that was his real name, but it fit.  He was an old veteran, and had enough pull to let our little excursions go unnoticed.  He didn’t always go, but he always took good care of us.  <br /><br />Targ was a Tiefling runemage.  He could hold his own in a fight, but he was also a sneaky little devil.  He enjoyed playing small pranks that could sometimes get him in trouble.  I couldn’t see a ring on his finger, but there was something between him and Torialla.  Strange for me, I know, but I didn’t ask too many questions.<br /><br />Thankfully Torialla was more interested in information than fighting.  With my help, and Targ’s magic, we were able to pass as a family of dwarves.  I typically did the talking, as that’s what I do.  I didn’t have to disguise my disgust of the Empire, but I did have to hide my knowledge.<br /><br />We learned that most of the empire is still in the dark about the arrangement with the nexuses and the underworld.  They are aware of the raids, but are more scared of the demons and technoprophets.  <br /><br />We seemed to have learned all that we could, so I proposed that I go on an extended mission, and spend several months traveling through the empire to get a bigger picture.  After some consideration (and probably consultation) Torialla agreed.  <br /><br />On our next mission, after they left, I left my image behind, but treestrided away to Blackdale.  I wanted to see if the inverted nexus was still there.  Partway I changed into my dragonborn persona.  <br /><br /><strong>Entry 3</strong><br /><br />What am I really doing back in the empire?  This is where my path lead me, so for now, I’ll accept that I should be here.  At least I can stay near the heart of the empire, and try to avoid the major battlefronts.  Maybe I can check on my parents while I’m here, though that gets me closer than I would like.<br /><br />Since I used this identity once before in the empire, I need to change it up a little bit this time.  I never attached a name to it, and I was mostly just seen by other members of the group.  Any guards that saw me should lie dead.  <br /><br />While I escaped notice below, a withered dragonborn draws attention.  I explain that I was on an expedition into the wilds many many years ago.  Then something strange happened, and everyone else was gone.  I rushed back, and while the cities were there, the blessings of the gods were not.  People there were using nexuses.  I was very confused, and I was pressured into using them, but I refused.  I dare not break my pact, no matter the cost.<br /><br />The gods were the one source of comfort left in the empire.  My “devotion” would be honored, though most are too troubled to talk long.<br /><br />I found work as a caravan guard.  I’m not a heavy fighter, but I can fight.  Most attacks came from the underworld raiding parties.  I hate to slay them, and spared them when I could, but I didn’t always get that choice.  Thankfully I never had to kill anyone I knew.<br /><br /><strong>Entry 4</strong><br /><br />The hordes are standing up to this madness.  I never would have thought them the sane ones, but these are not sane times.  They have rallied behind the Vanquisher. <br /><br />Kith is also working with the Vanquisher.  I’ve had about as much of the empire as I can stand for now, and I want to see Kith.  They are preparing for an attack on Terminus, and have gathered at a nexus south of there.  It’s close enough that I should be able to get there in a day or two.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Session 11</strong></p><p>&nbsp;I arrived at the horde camp too late to help, but thankfully I was not needed. &nbsp;They repelled an attack by the Brotherhood of Order. &nbsp;I know not their origins, but they seem to be comprised of many races. &nbsp;Their goal seems to be to stop the flow; and in a limited radius, they seem to be able to achieve it. &nbsp;Outside of that, a barrier of flow seems to exist. &nbsp;It's like they can corrupt a nexus to repel flow a certain distance. &nbsp;At that point, the flow seems to greatly affect anything that touches it or is near by. &nbsp;Also, fallen warriors have been know to wither and walk again within moments. </p><p>We don't need battle on yet another front, but at least this enemy is interesting. &nbsp;I want to know where they came from, who gathered them. &nbsp;Who discovered and taught them the geomancy to pervert a nexus in such a way? &nbsp;Vance is the only "person" who comes to mind, but why would he do this? &nbsp;I guess he doesn't make sense to me, so that's a question I cannot answer.</p><p>After the attack is repelled, the hordes learn of another attack on an Empire city. &nbsp;There will probably be more, but this is news we must act on. &nbsp;The Vanquisher wants the cult eliminated, and while they are dangerous, I still want to learn more than I want to eliminate.</p><p>Kith and I head off, but we disagree on what to do. &nbsp;He wants to find and slay the few who fled. &nbsp;Eventually we agree that the best way to fight this threat is to stop them from taking the next city.</p><p>After a few days of travel, we manage to reach Heimdall? in a few days. &nbsp;I don my dragonborn guise so as to not attract too much attention. &nbsp;Also, they will be much more willing to trust one of their own.</p><p>We gain entrance and head to the mayor's office. &nbsp;Before we get to speak, Arwel, Biger, and Ed enter. &nbsp;They carry the same grave news. &nbsp;I can't let them in on my identity quite yet, but once admitted to speak, I invite them in as well.</p><p>This city, like many others, is facing a difficult time, and fending off many attacks. &nbsp;No one wants to believe that a new threat exists, or that they need to adjust to fight it. &nbsp;They are worn thin, and worn out. &nbsp;At least we are taken about as seriously as to be expected. &nbsp;They double the guards on the Nexus, which is something. &nbsp;I also request that he communicate the threat with Tane'klenya.</p><p>Both in the office, and on our own, we contemplate ways to attack and defend the nexus. &nbsp;We know the Delphians can teleport through the ley lines into the nexus, as have corrupted hoard creatures. &nbsp; An attack could be made on all the guards at the same time. &nbsp;The guards are Norn, and extremely well trained, well equiped, and honored for their loyalty, but they have failed once before, somehow.</p><p>Once we leave the office, I reveal my identity to Arwel. &nbsp;She seems a little bit different than before. &nbsp;More battlehardened and wiser to the ways of the world. &nbsp;I like the change. &nbsp;She should be a great ally in the times ahead. &nbsp;Once we are hidden in a room at the inn, I let the others in on my true identity.</p><p>After much deliberation, study, resting, and a few trips back to the mayor's office, we start our preparations for the attack. &nbsp;The other attacks happened at night, and we antipated the same here. &nbsp;We take our places, and we wait.</p><p>&nbsp;Around midnight I detect something strange with the Nexus and approach the guards. &nbsp;They don't seem too happy to see me, and while they won't let me go in (understandably I guess. &nbsp;Why would a withered dragonborn want in an inverted nexus, especially if they are on high alert). &nbsp;When I ask him to check, he puts his hand on the door handle, and the next thing I know I'm waking up bleeding, and in a lot of pain.</p><p>The fight is on, and apparently, these "norn" are in on it. &nbsp;I turn myself invisible, leaving an image of my wounded body on the ground. &nbsp;I attack one of the norn, and while I got the jump on him, he did the same to me. &nbsp;I don't know if it was luck, or if he could see me, but as soon as I hit him, his blade tossed me back to the ground, bleeding more than ever.</p><p>Without me, they were able to get in and kill, capture, or scatter the geomancers inside. &nbsp;Typically, in a battle, I want to hide, strike from the shadows. &nbsp;I can't take a direct attack. &nbsp;Being invisible wasn't enough. &nbsp;I need to find a better way.</p><p>I'm glad we repelled the attack. &nbsp;We also learned about their tactics and capabilities. &nbsp;They are a fearsome opponent, but they can be stopped. &nbsp;I still wish I knew more about them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session 12</strong></p><p>What is going on here? &nbsp;I thought it was strange that the order was comprised of common people of all races. &nbsp;At least for their nexus strike team, they are comprised of the same people. &nbsp;The exact same people, with many different versions of themselves in the same reality. &nbsp;I didn't know that was possible. &nbsp;Sure, I've heard of people running into themselves before, though it's rare, but these individuals... &nbsp;When I peer into the past of most people, I can see their history, and a few possibilities. &nbsp;For my traveling companions, I usually see a point of focus, and a crack in the lens. &nbsp;For these people, it's more like a hall of mirrors, with each showing something different.</p><p>Whoever they are, they are dangerous. &nbsp;Whoever, or whatever is behind this is infinitely more so. &nbsp;I'm not the most learned geomancer, but I've never heard of anything that resembles this. &nbsp;We've seen that the gods are meddling in the world. &nbsp;I have to believe that one, or at least one, of them would have to be behind something of this magnitude. &nbsp;Which one I don't know. &nbsp;I've been ignoring them, and they've returned the favor for quite some time, but now it seems like I can't ignore them any longer. &nbsp;I should start with Arwel, but I need to learn about these gods.</p><p>....</p><p>Damned ring! &nbsp;I see that Kith has joined. &nbsp;I hope this means that we get to have a few more adventures together. &nbsp;The last quest was beyond anything I had yet experienced, and I'm looking forward to the next one. &nbsp;But, why was one of the order wearing a ring? &nbsp;And worst of all, how did the others find it first. &nbsp;I'll have to keep on top of that in the future. &nbsp;They now know that Kith and I have these rings. &nbsp;We stonewalled them, each in our own way. &nbsp;Kith outright refused, and I tried to explain that I really couldn't answer their questions. &nbsp;It does scary me a little about how many questions about the guild I really can't answer, but I'll have to be okay with that for now. &nbsp;Za'har was especially suspicious of us, and has enough authority to be quite formidable. &nbsp;He is also someone I am mostly unfamiliar with, so he has ever right to be suspicious. &nbsp;Thankfully Arwel and Ed were willing and able to vouch for our efforts to stop the ordering in Heimdal. &nbsp;They would have failed if it weren't for my senses, and I was nearly killed trying to get into the nexus, twice! &nbsp;Kith also greatly contributed to the effort, though I didn't really get to see any of it. </p><p>Thankfully they had seen something like this before, and though our rings may be tied to the Fochlucan lyricists. &nbsp;I have to admit that I haven't heard of them, but apparently Arwel and Sarit (no surprise there) are members. &nbsp;And apparently they can communicate though them. &nbsp;Wish our rings did that. &nbsp;Well, maybe I don't. &nbsp;Though I am glad that they have come to some level of acceptance, though I have undoubtedly lost a lot of trust. &nbsp;I was able to give Za'har some info on the workings of the underdark, and he will return the favor by making sure that I'm not wanted in the Empire. &nbsp;I'm sure they have bigger problems, but I just don't want to deal with getting caught.</p><p>I'm not used to getting caught in a deception. &nbsp;I've been able to talk my way into and out of anything for so long, that I have grown careless. &nbsp;I can't rely on merely on my charms, but I also have to keep my wits about me at all times. &nbsp;Especially now that I can't trust those around me. &nbsp;I don't know if I'll be able to get that back, but I would like to.</p><p>I have a lot of work ahead of me. &nbsp;I need to find out what the guild knows about the order. &nbsp;I need to learn about the gods and try to figure out who is responsible for this plague. &nbsp;I need to keep my wits about me, and I need to do some major mending. &nbsp;Maybe I should look Cameron up, see if he has any insight on this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session S14</strong> (Hell storyline)</p><p>&nbsp;<br />Welcome to hell.  I only wish I knew who was doing the welcoming.  It started like the quake that brought me into the empire last year, but ended up with me getting dumped on the ground from a chain.  A very informative chain I might add, but I’ll get to that in a minute.<br /><br />I wasn’t alone in hell, though I was the only new arrival.  Za’har, Admatha, Sahrit, and Arwel preceded me.  Za’har was working on hatching a red dragon’s egg.  I’m not sure what the rest were up to, but it must not have been that important.  Apparently Naxk and Vashir were ripped away in the same manner as I arrived.<br /><br />Hell is an interesting place.  We were in the 5th hell.  I never knew such a place existed, and while I’m very happy to know about this place, I have to say that I don’t feel a driving need to see more of it.  I’m very curious about what happened here, though I would be happy to find out second hand.<br /><br />I don’t know about the other layers, though from what I gathered from the others, the other layer that they visited was similar though not identical to this one.  The creepiest thing about hell is that it is very similar in general layout to the world I know, except that everything is dead.  <br /><br />There is no flow, no nexuses. We traveled to where the Tower of Sigil is located on our world, and while it’s still a very important location, the tower was not there.  In it’s place is a black factory of souls.  We’re guessing that it takes the souls of the damned and creates the devils that are crawling all over the place.  Their screams permeated the air.  We were tempted to assault it, but there were too many devils, and we had more pressing matters.<br /><br />Just being there is very strange.  There is no flow.  I thought the empire was stifling, but here the effects were even more oppressive.  I remembered doing things that I hadn’t done, seeing things that I haven’t seen.  Different possible versions of me all collapsed into one.  This is one thing I wish to experience more of.  I do wonder greatly about the decisions in my own past.  I guess that’s one thing to look forward to if I ever end up here again.<br /><br />What’s more important is what the existence of the hells mean.  It has the feeling of a failed and conquered world.  This looks to be the fate of our world if the nexuses are all destroyed.  We just can’t let that happen!<br /><br />The other item of curiosity is that there are believed to be nine hells, though I am only aware of one living world.  I wonder if a new world is created each time one falls, or if there were ten worlds once, and nine of them have fallen.  I’m guessing that Joseph’s past, and possibly Kith’s and possibly Isaline’s pasts as well may lead to some clues.<br /><br />I know this battle that rages on in our own world is a big deal, though I get the feeling that this one is more important.  Maybe it is the last world standing, or maybe this war can tip the scales in a battle among the gods, or among the hells.  I would just like to kick them all out and let our world be.<br /><br />After all of this, and I haven’t even mentioned what happened to me since I’ve been there. From the chains, I received three visions:<br /><br />Man Dressed in grey robe carrying a staff  --  Looks like vance with no missing eye, face looks whole<br />  talking to a 10 ft creatures, vaguely woman shape wrapped in chains with a featureless mask covering her face.<br />  Man smugly says: There is a task that you must perform for me if you wish me to keep your secret. Melora has become... an obstacle. We shall pay her a little visit...<br /><br />A woman I recognize as the woman from the vision of the spire - bruises, dark hair, armor - wearing dented armor, + holy symbol that wasn't recognized (spiral)<br />  she's crying and bound in chains.  As best she is, she's embracing a bald human man in chains.  Lined features.  She says "I love Tharisdun"  And he returns the hug<br />  <br />Same woman in battle.  Her allies getting cut down by a dwarf in regal armor + hammer and rapier.  She works her way to him.  He grins in anticipation.  <br /><br /><br />What’s strangest about these visions is that I received them at all.  At no other time in hell could I get a reading off of anything.  I was walking around blind.  But they are very important, especially the name Tharisdun.  <br /><br />Levistus had this to say about Tharisdun: <br />While the temple stands, it should have been impossible for you to even learn it!<br />I am oathbound to say nothing of the matter other than to say it is utmost importance that you do not pursue the matter further.  Nothing less than the fate of the world is at stake.  You will be opposed from all sides!<br /><br />We left the hell near where the portal they took to get here was located, which is by a frozen lake.  Arwel had a way to return us to our home world.  We all piled into the portable hole for the trip.  This was her first attempt at this, and we wanted to make sure we all ended up in the same place in case anything went wrong.<br /><br />We made it back to our world, and we did appear next to the frozen lake, though there were also tracks in the snow.  Vance had performed some kind of ceremony on the lay line.  It involved the sacrifice of several followers and withdrawing the handprint from “evil” Sahrit.  This caused him some pain, but it’s unknown if he survived or not.<br /><br />We followed and found an ornate ziggurat shaped building.  It must be tied to Vance somehow, but I’m not sure how.  Again we felt that this was too much of a deviation, and we could divine no additional information about Sahrit’s brother’s location.  <br /><br />We returned to the lake.  Sahrit spent some time learning what he could about the portal.  Arwel tried digging through the lake towards the portal, but make little progress.  Once Sahrit was ready, Za’har used a few shots from his fire wand to melt a path to the portal.<br /><br />Admatha made us all invisible, among other spells before we reentered hell number 5.  Once through we made quick work of the ice demons guarding the portal, but feared that they had alerted others.  We moved quickly and despite a wrong turn or two, found the frozen body of Moradin.<br /><br />Levistus was also there, standing next to a sizable ice elemental.  I was in back and around the corner, so I couldn’t see exactly what was going on.  Levistus advised that freeing Moradin would be disasterous.  He claimed that the blessings of the empire were being fed from Moradin’s power, and if he were freed, those in the empire would quickly wither.  <br /><br />This may sound harsh, but I’m okay with that outcome.  May parents would be affected as well, though they seem mostly dead inside, just like most of those in the empire.  I don’t want to see them all become withered undead, but that would be better than prolonging the “life” of the empire further.<br /><br />Za’har might agree with this, or he may have faith that Moradin cares enough for his people in the empire to continue powering the blessing.  Za’har raised his firewand and tried to free Moradin.  Unfortunately, Levistus countered with an equivalent ice wand.  <br /><br />I don’t want to think that Levistus is crafty just because of this, but he knows the game, and seems to have a fairly pragmatic view of things.  This makes him dangerous.  But in the short term at least, it also makes him someone we can work with.  We struck a deal with him.  We would bring Vance, and he would release Rebin.  The hope then is that Rebin could reason with Moradin, and at least calm his anger towards Levistus so that he can aid against the more pressing threats.  Vance’s power would then be used as a replacement to Moradin and would then power the empire’s “blessing”.  Blah<br /><br />I hope the truth of the situation will help the empire decide to ween themselves off their dependence on stolen power.  They should regain appriciation for the nexuses, quit destroying them, but leave a few inverted for the sake of those in the underdark.<br /><br />We learned a few other choice nuggets of information.  Rebin is actually Moradin’s son.  Somehow he managed to get enough power and conciousness to use an avatar for a period of time.<br /><br />Asmodeus is a common enemy.  He takes over worlds once they have lost all of their nexi.  He’s a tricky one, but not as old as Levistus.  <br /><br />Levistus played Moradin in the little play they put on for the group in Sigil.  Other gods were played by other demons or devils.  Though those that entered later may have been true.<br /><br />Bacaab stole Vecna’s power, and it has taken him millennia to restore it.  The insinuation here is that Vecna became Vance, and will become Vecna again.<br /><br />Then there is the question of Tharisdun, and the woman from the visions.  And the mention of Melora.  Need to remember to ask Kith about her.<br /><br />I thought I had a nice arrangement with the gods.  I ignore them, and they ignore me.  They don’t seem to be upholding their end of the bargain.  There are so many gods, and histories, and stories, and plots, and alliances, and feuds that I can’t keep them straight, especially when I have very little background to work from.  I really need to learn about the gods, what they do, what their followers are like, etc.  I need to know the stories behind those that are depicted in Sigil, and those who are not.  I can’t remain in the dark any more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session F14</strong><br /><br />I find myself back to about where I left off, more or less.  Almost like my trip through hell was a dream.  If only...  No, I shouldn’t think like that.  Even though it was a hell, and it was far from pleasant, it was beyond informative.  <br /><br />I didn’t know much about the world when I started, but that I why I traveled.  I never imagined that our existence was this complex.  I’ve learned much more than I ever thought there was to know, yet I am awed by the sheer magnitude of what I don’t know.  And who knows what will be revealed if I ever pull this layer back.<br /><br />I told my traveling companions much of what I saw.    It will take a while for what I did say to sink in, if that’s even possible.  I told them about the hells and the black factory that stood in place of Sigil.  I told them about Moradin’s captivity and Levistus..  about how he rules that level of hell, how he has the great wand of ice, how he hates Azmodius, and how we bargained to capture Vance to trade for Rebin and a chance of freeing Moradin without destroying the empire.  I told them about Vance, and how he took his power back from Sahrit<br /><br />However, I couldn’t tell them everything.  Some of the visions I saw concerned Kith’s past.  He wished for me to keep the stories involving &lt;insert name here&gt;.  This story related to whatever was on the blank scroll that I showed him on the night the Emperor fell.  <br /><br />Kith and I stayed behind on the first teleport of our journey.  Biger accused us of needing to contact our secret group involving the rings.  I know my credibility was already low, and this didn’t help, but I needed to talk to Kith first.  Hopefully my news of Admatha and all the information I provided will help make up for it.<br /><br />Speaking of the guild, Cameron was with us for this journey.  Not only with us, but he had Kith give his ring to Biger so that he could impart an image of “Janus” to him.  I don’t know where Cameron came across this image but I can probably guess.  Later, Cameron donned Janus’s appearance, and I recognized him.  <br /><br />His name is Kalenon, former leader of the Herion Tribe.  Their territory is around Intempestivus.  I’m not sure what happened to him to cause him to become Jonus, but none of the other members of his new brotherhood seem to have come from his old tribe.<br /><br />At any rate, scrying was useless.  We could scry Janus, or any of the ordered cities.  He’s probably inside one of them, but which one?  We have no way to see into, or communicate with any of the cities to find out.  The rest of the group is going to see The Priestess of the Black.  I’m not going to waste my time with her.  I’m going to go back to sigil and see if I can do anything to affect the nexuses from there.  Something should be possible, given how important and well guarded that location is.  I just don’t know what.<br /><br />It seems like I’ve managed to cover the beginning and the end while leaving out most of the middle.  We found the armorer who created the forged Norn armor.  The order came from Dragontamer’s wife about a year and a half ago.  However, she ordered four sets, not three.<br /><br />Grazzt is holding someone dear to Kith prisoner in a cage.  This is very obvious bait for Kith, but she is quite important to him.  I wish we could go and rescue her, but there are other pressing matters.  I hope I can help him when the time comes.  He doesn’t seem to think that there is time, but he also doesn’t want the help of those he can’t trust.  For me, the threat of another ordering is too much to ignore.  If the quake barrier were all that was to it, I wouldn’t mind so much, but I don’t want to see this plague is causes claim any more.<br /><br /><strong>Session S-15</strong></p><p>Fickle fickle fate.  Maybe it wants to keep me away from Sigil because I can’t do anything there.  Then again, maybe it’s because I could.  Especially after today.’<br /><br />Fate plopped me down in Oraculum (well under, way under) along with a sizable group of people.  A lot was going on, and I was glad to be able to help, at least a little.  I feel bad about not being able to help out more. <br /><br />There were a few people there I didn’t really know.  A few geomancers along with a elvish druid Dariel, among others.<br /><br />Oraculum is unique in that it has two nexi, and they are fairly close together.  Our goal was to revert one nexus and then combine them.  The other group was to draw the attention of the creatures above ground.  The ritual we were performing couldn’t handle too much of an interuption.  <br /><br />Our first task was to find a suitable focus to create the new nexus.  Kith suggested we use our rings, but besides a scary reaction, it didn’t amount to much.  I wonder why Ktih wants to get rid of his ring though.  Mine hasn’t been good for much other than drawing unwanted suspicion.<br /><br />Anyways, Joseph provided a skeleton of a frost giant to use as our foucs.  Before we could start though, we had to revert one nexus.  I had never done this before, though I tried.  I had help of course, Iraja and two other geomancers were helping.  Once we coaxed out the heart and I tried to hold it steady while positive energy was channeled into it.  Unfortunately, it was a little to erratic for me.  I had to  hand it off to Iraja and watch her endure the pain the inverted heart was causing her.<br /><br />Once the nexus was flipped, we started phase two.  Energies from each nexus were channeled into me and into Za’har.  We pumped that energy through Joseph and into the skeleton.  Dariel provided healing as needed.  We were attacked once or twice, but I couldn’t even turn to look.  Za’har left to help with a fight but rejoined near the end.<br /><br />Once complete, there wasn’t an explosion or anything, but we did create a balanced nexus!  I loved all nexus energy, but this was purer and more powerful than anything I had experience before.  It had significant effects on some of those around us, including bringing Admatha back to life!<br /><br />Maybe this is our salvation.  This is how we can solve the plague, allow all to refresh, even correct an ordered nexus.  This could save the lands in the underdark and make their curse irrelevant.  Maybe it could even help the empire.<br /><br />I hope that it’s stable, but it just feels right, so I can only hope.<br /><br /><strong>Session F-16</strong></p><p>We are learning so very very much about the history of this world, yet many, many questions remain.<br /><br />The current theory is that the world is acting as Therisdun’s cage, with the nexuses acting as the bars.&nbsp; This leaves open questions about the nature of the flow.&nbsp; Why it exists and what it’s purpose is.<br /><br />Also, why are there different types of nexuses?&nbsp; I had always assumed that a positive nexus is the normal state.&nbsp; Now I’m not so sure.&nbsp; If that were true, how were inverted nexuses created or discovered initially?&nbsp; I know why there are currently needed, but what was known about that before the curse?&nbsp; Or did the knowledge of how to invert a nexus come with the curse?&nbsp; Was the curse granted to create inverted nexuses?<br /><br />And what of the new types of nexuses?&nbsp; There is the balanced nexus we created in Orraculum.&nbsp; This feels like it should be the natural state of a nexus, or maybe just the final state.&nbsp; Did all nexuses start this way, or is this a new creation?&nbsp; I wish I could view a nexus’s past as easily as a person.<br /><br />Then there are the ordered nexuses.&nbsp; This affect may reach across the flow to unify all the possibilities into only one.&nbsp; If one of these nexuses were to be destroyed, would it destroy the nexus in all versions of the world?&nbsp; It may.&nbsp; Also, we were told that they only target inverted nexuses.&nbsp; This hasn’t been true in my world, as they have targeted a nexus that was positive at the time.&nbsp; But what if they could order a nexus in a different version of reality and still affect one in mine?&nbsp; Do they even need to be in my reality to do it?&nbsp; Or does a nexus suddenly become ordered?&nbsp; Or does the process unify the flow before the ordering is final, so we at least have a chance to intervene?&nbsp; That’s a really scary thought.&nbsp; At least our new balanced nexus is a new nexus and is unlikely to be inverted in any version of history.<br /><br />And what about the hells?&nbsp; Where do they fit in?&nbsp; They are obviously failed versions of our world.&nbsp; Versions where all the nexuses are removed.&nbsp; But how do they come to be?&nbsp; Does the world fail, and a new world get built?&nbsp; Or are there a set number, and we live on the last one?&nbsp; Is it the last one, or are there more?&nbsp; I have only been to one layer of hell, though I hear there are more.&nbsp; Is he flow constantly managing and warping different worlds?&nbsp; If that were the case, if this one were to fall, it would be another hell, but as long as the possibility of other worlds existing, there would still be a world similar to this one.&nbsp; But can the ordering reach across that an eliminate the possibility that this world still exists?&nbsp; That’s a really scary though.<br /><br />Then there are the gods.&nbsp; They know what’s going on, but aren’t telling.&nbsp; I don’t follow any particular god, so I don’t know much about them.&nbsp; I talked to Arwel about them, and she’s not happy with them either, though is still devout to St. Cuthbert.&nbsp; He feels like the Raven Queen was behind the strange quakes from before, but that she has been stripped of her power.&nbsp; But the quakes continue, and seem to be getting even more strange, and involving even more people.&nbsp; If the Raven Queen is no longer behind them (if she ever was) then who or what is?<br /><br />I have a lot of answers.&nbsp; I can only hope that some of them are correct, and some are not as I fear, but I still have a lot more questions.&nbsp; When I saw the temple of Sigil collapse, was that in this version of history, or was that a world that became a hell?&nbsp; Who is the lady that was flying above sigil and seemingly the cause?&nbsp; How do we get to, let alone repair an ordered nexus?&nbsp; How can we create more balanced nexuses, and what effect will that have?&nbsp; Was I brought or Oracculum because I needed to be there, or was I being diverted from Sigil for some reason?&nbsp; Or both?&nbsp; <br /><br />Speaking of Sigil, what can I do from there?&nbsp; I hope I can repair, or at least analyze an ordered nexus.&nbsp; Sigil must be more than just a tower, just a shrine, and just a map.&nbsp; It must have greater ties into the world.&nbsp; I only wish I knew what they were.</p><p><strong>Session S-16</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">No new answers to report, but I've got
a few more questions to jot down.  Thankfully these don't seem to be
the “what is the true nature and history of this world and what
should I be doing about it” type questions.  These are more of the
“would be good to know” type.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First, what's Ed's teacher's role to
play with this.  She showed up for a minute after a quake while we
were on our way to visit the Tsen tribe.  I could see that she was
part of the ritual to summon Demigorgon.  I could also see some of
her time training Ed, some of her time with the T'sen, and even that
a previous version of Ed had killed someone dear to her.  What we
make her help the new Ed?  More to the point, what is the real story?
 Who was on what side, supporting what cause?  The answer to that may
help figure out what she's up to now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Second, what's the deal with the quake
in Arx?  I know quakes move people through the flow to other versions
on this world.  That must be what happened to us, but why did only
some of us remember?  And why did those of us who forgot still have
some memories of the events after being reminded?  Maybe only some of
us were brought along?  Was it a case of two realities collapsing on
each other?  It would be easy to write this off as chance, though I'm
hesitant to say any of my life, at least this past year or so has
actually been chance.  I feel like I'm still someone's puppet, though
I don't know who, or even if it's always the same puppet-master,
though I aim to find out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Questions aside, this has been a
productive trip so far.  We made it to the Tsen  encampment where we
were able to meet with their leader, and get a pledge for at least
some support.  Delphia is also going to send what they can.  Of
course they don't like the idea of everyone being involved, but we're
going to need as much support to take and hold the city as possible. 
Also, I'll be a lot more comfortable with many eyes watching over the
new nexus.  I want to keep anyone from having enough power or
influence to do anything to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Of course we had to do more than ask. 
I hate to bring them in to this, as they have tried their best to
keep out of trouble.  They haven't done crazy experiments like the
Delphians, or live under the “blessings” of the”gods” like
the empire.  Of course, in the same vein, I had to convince Sibil (a
Delphian leader who also had the wisdom to avoid these mistakes, but
lacked the influence to stop their folly, to apologize and take
responsibility for their mistakes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Why should we all have to pay the price
for these mistakes?  Why do I have to ask others to pay for mistakes
that they themselves avoided, or even actively tried to stop?  Or
maybe I should look at this another way.  At least we have something
that the different groups can agree on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Session F17</strong>
</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Another one.  I've experienced two
quakes since we created the balanced nexus, and both of them have
felt like reality collapsing instead of changing.  I don't know what
changed this time, as it seemed like my reality was dominant this
time.  Kith, Arwel and  Za'har joined Dariel, Ed and me.  I didn't
get a chance to talk to them about what they were up to, as the
Vanquisher showed up yet again.  He seems to be a popular guy with
whoever is doing this.  I was scrying him at the time, to see how he
faired in Terminus, and then he appeared before us.  Now he thinks I
summoned him.  I tried to dissuade him, but maybe I did have a part
in it?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">At least it was convenient.  It saved
us the trip to Terminus, and allowed all of the members of this
little coalition we've founded to meet.  Of course, everyone wants to
try to finagle as much power and influence as they can get.  And of
course, not everyone gets along.  The Vanquisher doesn't want the
Delphians involved, no one wants the empire, and even I'm a little
dubious about the denizens of the Underdark.  But we don't have
commitments from either group yet.  Za'har has offered his word that
he will bring warriors, but he hasn't secured them yet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Also, to make life a little more
uncomfortable for Sybil, both the Vanquisher and possibly the empire
will require Delphia's aid in transporting their troops.  Sybil
couldn't make this commitment herself, but promised to check.  She
and the Vanquisher will stay with the warrior tribe to await their
answer.  We headed out to the Underdark.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I tried to scry the magistrate, but
expected failed.  I scried his room, but saw that he has a
replacement.  Others were scrying the room as well, and we were
noticed, so at least nothing has changed there.  The real question is
what has changed?  We dressed Arwel up as a drow, let Dariel sink
into the stone, hid Kith in my bag, and Za'har and Ed hid in a
portable hole.  We managed to learn a few interesting things.  Most
of their military is devoted to protecting the nexuses from
Beardthicket.  Also, their was a revolt of the warlocks a few weeks
ago that has yet to be resolved.  That's a story unto itself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Back to the story at hand.  Back as our
normal selves, we were able to get an audience with the Matron of the
lead house in Tataclenia.  My affiliation with the magistrate helps
open doors.  To boil it down, they are unable to commit because they
are occupied.  They need their situations resolved before they can
help.  She would have promised support if I could have promised the
heads of Beardthicket and the &lt;?&gt; on a plate.  I'm not in a
situation to make those promises, so I thanked her for her time, and
the tea and cookies, and we were dismissed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We returned above ground to discuss our
options.  Taking care of Beardthicket would free up troops from the
empire, and from the Underdark, but finding has so far proven to be
impossible.  He was caught up in a trap once, but he still escaped. 
We decided to see what was up with the Warlocks.  We also thought
that Naxk was involved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We went to the other Underdark city to
see if we could talk to the renegade Warlocks.  Word is that they
burned their contracts with Asmodeus and signed a new one with
Baalzebul.  I didn't know this was possible, but anything to weaken
Asmodeus grip is welcome.  We met with the magistrate of this city
and were able to convince him to let us negotiate... and reconnoiter.
 We just needed to speak with the leader of the group warlocks that
were surrounding the palace.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">He was a piece of work.  He would only
agree to tell his forces not to target us, and he could promise more
than that.  Oh, and he tried to bind me to an oath to tell him first
what I saw in there.  I had offered to tell him, but he wouldn't
budget without an oath, and I wasn't about to give it.  I mentioned
that the matron wouldn't look favorably on our deaths, and we left to
enter the Palace.  The guards at the door made us wait for a minute
or two, but allowed us entry.  We were lead in and were allowed to
see who was inside.  Baalzebul was there, along with the emperor that
Kith assassinated.  Beazibul rules the seventh level of hell, a realm
that became a hell where the empire was too successful.  I don't know
what this means, or what he wants, and I'm a little uncomfortable
with this, but I hope this is bad for Asmodeus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session F18</strong></p><p>&nbsp;When I started my travels, I needed to get away from the Empire.  Once I had a taste of the outside world, I wanted to experience it all.  Little did I know what that meant at the time.  Since then, I’ve visited most of the known world, as well as the hidden lands beneath it.  I’ve traveled deep into the Wilds and entered the Tower of Sigil.  I’ve been beyond the boundaries of this world and have seen what hell looks like.  I have not, until today, felt lost.<br /><br />There are many powers with many perspectives and many goals.  I would like to count myself amongst them.  My job has been to convince others to join my cause, to share my goals.  I’ve learned much on my travels, and while my perspective has changed a great deal, my goal has not.  My path had been clear.  But after today, I’m not sure if I’m still on that path.<br /><br />My goal is still to restore nexuses to prominence, and to remove the outside influences that have causes so much trouble, so much mistrust, and so much misdirection.  This means exiling the demons, the devils, the lords of hell, and the so called gods.  If things were even that simple, then today would be a success.  We gained a valuable ally for both taking and holding Oraculum, and for diminishing Asmodeus’s sway in the underdark.<br /><br />But we also slighted this ally.  Baalzebul understands that this cause is larger than us, and isn’t looking to make us jump to secure their aid.  They are, however, behind Beardthicket and his attempts to destroy the inverted nexues.  The inverted nexuses are a source of power for Asmodeus.  By eliminating them, they greatly diminish Asmodeus’s power on this world.  <br /><br />As I travel more and more, Asmodeus seems to be the primary opponent.  He seems to be the one pulling the strings to cause nexuses to be inverted.  But after visiting the hells, I believe his ultimate goal is to destroy them all.  I’d write more about the reasons the nexuses exist in the first place, but I don’t want to get off track.  Anyways, I can’t just let Beardthicket destroy nexuses.  It seems to be a permanent solution to a temporary problem, as I am unaware of any way to recreate the nexuses once destroyed.  Also, each nexus destroyed brings the world one step close to Asmodeus’s ultimate design.<br /><br />But maybe destroying a few nexus is worth it.  Maybe there is a way to get them back?  They were created once (at least), maybe they can be recreated.  I will have to look into this.  But it will also severely hurt the denizens of the underdark.  But again, this is more of a grey area than I may like.  They do have their curse, their contract, and their loyalties.  I know some genuinely want a way out of that life, and others revel in it.  Baalzebul is offering a way out for the former, but what about the latter?  I don’t have a good answer for that.  I would like to remove Asmodeus and see what happens.<br /><br />Anyways, as I said before, we slighted our new ally.  While we were talking to them, Beardthicket mounted an attack on one of the two nexuses near Bael’turath.  There was an actual earthquake, and most of the warlocks guarding Baalzebul’s stronghold left.  We left as well.  I scried each nexus to locate where the attack was taking place, and saw that Beardthicket had caused a cave in around the nexus so that he could work uninterrupted.<br /><br />I enhanced everyone’s movement speed, and we rushed there as fast as we could.  To avoid the battle, and to actually get to the nexus, we all hid in Ed’s portable hole and Dariel became and earth elemental and carried us through the rock.  I tried to talk to Beardthicket, but Kith was trying to sneak around to him and was spotted and he teleported out.  But the nexus was still deteriorating.  Thankfully we were at a nexus and I could use geomancy to aid my sight, I found an invisible geomancer off to one side.  I placed an illusion of her over her.  Others tried to subdue her but she also teleported away.  <br /><br />I could tell Beardthicket went to the other nexus, so I gathered everyone and teleported there.  Since talking didn’t work last time, they attempted to subdue him physically, but weren’t able to do enough to stop him before he teleported out again.  This time they went to Eloyes.  I scried Beardthicket again, and saw that he had changed his appearance.  He looked like a much more presentable, typical, and forgettable dwarf.  I followed him around for a few minutes until he met up with someone who I can only assume was his assistant.  She spotted my scry and destroyed it.<br /><br />At least we know how he’s been hiding, though he will undoubtably change his appearance again.  Not that he doesn’t have most of the Empire and Underdark looking for him, he also knows I wish to stop him.  Even if he doesn’t know who I am, he knows I am a reasonably powerful geomancer.  I’m not sure what he can do with this knowledge, but I need to keep that in mind.  I don’t think he will do anything to go after me.  He can’t afford to expose himself.  And if he is truly working with Baalzebul, and they truly want to protect the balanced nexus, Beardthicket won’t meddle with it, and that’s what I care about most.<br /><br />After all this was said and done, we returned to Baalzebul to appologize.  I’m sorry we can’t see eye to eye on Beardthicket, but he recognizes the importance of the balanced nexus, and will still aid us.  We stayed to rest up for the night.  They day was very exausting, and I needed the rest.  I will miss the accommodations once we leave though.  I’ll have to return here again some day.<br /><br />My priority is to the health and wellbeing of this world.  His is to stopping Asmodeus.  I think that is where we differ.  I can live with that.<br /><br />Maybe I’m not so lost after all.<br /><br /><strong>Session S18</strong></p><p><br />I don’t usually write about my dreams.  Then again, I usually don’t dream about writing about my dreams either.  I expect that I waken shortly, still in this overly comfortable bed in the Warlock’s stronghold.  The presence of two former emrorers, along with the recent fights over the nexus, not to mention the sheer amount of magic that has run through these halls must have helped spawned this dream.<br /><br />Anyways, onto the dream.  I awoke in Sigil along with Admatha, Dragontamer, Sahrit, and Joseph.  Everyone seemed at little surprised to be here, though Dragontamer was lost.  He had heard of some of the prophesies regarding this place, but knew little more than that.  We filled him in a little on it’s history, and we used the map downstairs to help.<br /><br />We also found out something interesting from the map.  Balanced nexuses appear as grey.  I say nexuses because, while there is only one now, we looked back in time and saw more.  All of them infact.  The first nexus was here at Sigil.  We watched as it’s power crawled along the world, forming new nexuses as it went.  Then, over time, they all seemed to change to positive.  Not sure what influenced, or why positive instead of negative, but they seemed to degenerate that way.  It is, however, impossible to get a sense of timescale, so I have no idea how stable our new balanced nexus really is.  I just know that it’s still balanced.<br /><br />Everone had pressing questions, especially for me and what had happened in the Underdark, but Dragontamer’s concern was for his assistant.  I scried her, and as he expected, she was freaking out.  I communicated with her to let her know that he was okay, and that he would be returned shortly.  I also passed the message from Dragontamer that she was right about everything.<br /><br />Given the dangers of the area, and Dragontamer’s lack of ability to be teleported or hidden away in a portable hole, the only way to return him was to use the map.  Unfortunately, the map can only take us to other nexuses, and the empire is running low.  And those that it has are sealed off.  I arranged with Dragontamer’s assistant to meet us at the closest nexus.  She agreed, and so we went.<br /><br />She met us as the nexus with some strange news.  Tiamat’s priests had broken the curse on the dragon orb!  I didn’t even know they were trying.  That’s what I get for not paying too much attention to them.  Anyways, she said they would be weary, and now was the time to strike.  <br /><br />We found an out of the way spot near a lay line so I could do some reconnaissance.  We started by looking for the fire wand that Za’har had in hell.  Sadly, it had fallen into the hands of Demogorgon.  One head looked like it was about to zap the other.  I tried to encourage him, but only managed to focus there rage onto me.  I wish them a nice day and let them be.  <br /><br />With that wand unreachable, we figured the priestess of the red might have hers stored at her palace.  After a little preparation Dragontamer’s assistant teleported us there.  We fought with some fire elementals, and made our way to an alter.  Sahrit attempted to offer his blood to Tiamat, but was rejected.  Dragontamer’s assistant offered hers and was accepted.  Inside we found not the wand, but Moradin’s helm.  Sahrit donned it, and of we went to try to retrieve the orb.<br /><br />They were ready for us, and instantly angered that we had the helm.  No help for it, we were going to have to fight.  If we could kill the White, then the orb would revert to the next strongest white dragon.  Hopefully this was the assistant.  <br /><br />The white was in the middle of the icy room.  The others were in the corners.  Joseph blacked out the room.  He and Sahrit rushed forward to attack the white dragon.  Admatha was no where to be seen.  The assistant headed of to the right to hold the green dragon at bay.  I made myself invisible and sent an image of myself to the left corner behind the black.  I was trying to draw some attention, but completely failed.<br /><br />The white dragon drew back and the dragons tried to destroy us with their breath weapons, but they had no effect on us.  Their direct attacks were much more damaging.  The darkness helped, but the blows came fast and hard.  I joined the battle near the white dragon.  Barnebus was holding off the blue and the white dragons, Sahrit was making a little headway, and Joseph was draining the white for as much as he could.  The assistant joined the attack on the white, but it wasn’t enough.<br /><br />Sahrit was down and bleeding, the assistant was dead.  Joseph was hurt.  Ann had tried to take over the red, but failed.  I had given what little I had left to keep Sahrit alive.  I could avoid a couple attacks if it came down to that, but things were looking dire.  I would survive, and I could take a couple people with me, but not everyone.<br /><br />Admatha came rushing into the room.  She prayed to her god to help the assistant, and her request was granted.  Ann joined with Joseph for a very devastating strike on the white dragon.  It was old and withered down to practically nothing.  The final blow was struck, killing the white dragon.  <br /><br />The orb must have reverted to Dragontamer’s assistant.  The dragons changed to more gemlike dragons.  They were still upset, but they quit attacking.  I took the crown, wanting to use it for leverage.  I want them to help reclaim the nexus.  I didn’t get to antagonize Demogorgon into joining this fight, so I want to bring this fight to him (them?).  The red dragon wanted the crown back, and was getting a little snippy.  I gave in and gave it back.  I hope to go talk to them tomorrow and get them to join in.<br /><br />Fighting the 5 priests of Tiamat...  still not sure that actually happened.  It surely wasn’t what I had planned.  Hopefully it actually happened.  I really like the idea of the dragons at least tending a little bit more towards our side.  I’ll probably roll over, rub my eyes, and still be in the Underdark.  Maybe this is a sign of something I should work towards.  Guess we’ll see when I wake up.<br /><br /></p><p><strong>Session F19</strong></p><p>Yes, yes it was all real.  In fact, there is more to this than I had imagined, and I’m not sure how I feel about it.<br /><br />Before I knew it, the next day was upon us.  As agreed, we returned to the white priest’s cave.  The red had departed, but the others remained.  I wanted to ask them to join our cause.<br /><br />Maybe that this point I should pause for a moment.  By our, I really meant me and Za’har and the others that have chosen to travel with us.  And by cause, I mean taking back Oraculum.  There are goals and issues awaiting us on the other side, but now that the ordering is has been dealt with, this is the cause in front of us.<br /><br />But now ‘our’ extends well past out small, evershifting bands.  We now have the support of the Vanquisher, the T’Sen tribe, the rogue warlocks from the Underdark under Bazibul and the recently departed Emporer, Sybil, and the Delphian forces she can muster, along with Dragontamer and Ironheart from the empire.  The drow from the Underdark haven’t pledged their allegiance yet, but as it is obviously in their best interests to do so, I have confidence that they will.<br /><br />But there is even more interest in retaking Oraculum from Demogorgon than even that.  The gods themselves are getting involved.  I would like to say that they have joined our cause at our request, but I didn’t ask them to join, and ‘usurped’ seems a more accurate term than joined. <br /><br />Back to my story...  We were visiting the dragon priests when a god (I’m told it was Ioun) sent everyone a message.  There is to be a gathering of a council to deal with Demogoron in seven days time.  By everyone, I don’t mean everyone in the world, but everyone interested in our cause.  I know this is a little vague, but when I asked, I didn’t get a clear answer on who had received the message.  After receiving the message, the priests decided to send the green as their delegate to the council.  <br /><br />We left, but before we could truely be on our way, we received a blessing.  I wish I could have refused, but I was not given any such choice.  Actually I wish I could refuse the gods’ involvement in this at all, but I doubt I get much say in that either.  At least we have the same goal for the moment.<br /><br />That would be the end of it, except that this blessing is from Therisdun himself.  Maybe he’s a kindred soul in wanting to be rid of the other gods.  I have to assume that it’s in his best interest to either exile Demogorgon or reclaim the balanced nexus.  Can’t really ask him, so I have no choice but to accept it and continue on.<br /><br />I decided to check on Za’har, see how his efforts were going.  He was in a version of the Empire ruled by Ironheart.  Dragontamer’s wife’s treachery was never discovered, and he was eventually killed.  Za’har did bring me some disturbing news.  There’s a shapeshifter that now possesses the sword.  Za’har suspects that he has a guild ring, and that he was responsible for Dragontamer’s death.  I promised to see if I could see a ring, and let him know what I could find out.  I don’t know if this is the Magistrate or another.<br /><br />I’m not sure what to make of this.  The guild hasn’t asked anything of me since locating Sigil.  I relished their ability to shake the Priestess of the Black, but since that time, I’ve grown more and more warry.  Kith has also joined, but he has his reservations.  He wanted to sacrifice the rings in Oraculum, but they weren’t sufficient.  I still have my ring, and I really haven’t given it a lot of thought in a while.  Though disregarding them seems dangerous.  I don’t know if this is something I can just quit, or even if I want to.  I don’t know what their goals or reasons are, so it’s hard for me to act.  Maybe once this is done I can look into them more.<br /><br />We arrived at the city hosting the council meeting.  We got here as fast as we could, so we’re a little early.  The city is built like a fortress.  It doesn’t have the exposed tubing of other Delphian cities, but shifting plates.  We were questioned at the wall, checked against a list, and admitted.  I learned later that they are refusing entry for even citizens of the town.  Seems a little pointless to me, especially since we were still attacked.<br /><br />But before that, we were directed to a large, red, important looking hotel.  We were each given a room on the first floor.  A few of my companions enjoyed playing with all the gnomish devices provided.  Even the first floor is well apointed.<br /><br />We didn’t stay long.  I popped my head into the dining area, and saw a chieftain I recognized.  Before I could say hello, several gods entered the hotel.  They were checked into rooms on the second floor.  We were treated well as guests, but they were treated with reverence.  <br /><br />We made it out to a bar down the street, and a great time was had by all.  Sahrit played wonderful music all night.  I chatted up some locals.  It’s been so long since I’ve just had a night to relax and enjoy the place, I felt out of practice.  Thankfully most of the gents were too stunned, or drunk, to notice any mistakes.  This is where I found out about the strict admittance policy, and that the general public is unaware of the upcoming gathering.  A few of the gods did stop by the bar and cause quite a stir.<br /><br />We stumbled into our beds for the night, after purging the alcohol from our systems.  We didn’t make it through the night without getting attacked.  There was a great noise.  Admatha shouted that there was an invisible intruder.  I poped over to Arwel’s room so that I could quake her into her armor.  I’ve grown used to sleeping in my leathers throughout my travels.  Arwel tends to wear quite a bit more, and I imaging that sleeping in it would be impossible, even for me, let alone someone softer.<br /><br />Arwel charged out into the hall.  When I followed, someone shouted that he had run up the stairs.  I tried to give chase, but all I could do was tell it was a shape shifter.  I’m not sure if this was the magistrate, the sword bearer, or another.  But Sahrit and Barnebus were able to stop it before I could catch up.<br /><br />There were also attacking hordes outside.  There was an earthquake, and a huge tear in the street outside.  The gods and our white dragon had gotten involved.  I rush downstairs, then outside, but by the time I made it there, things were mostly resolved.  Za’har, Biger, and others were there as well.  Maybe they heard the commotion and came running?<br /><br />The ground was getting further and further away.  It seems like the city itself is flying!  This truly is a remarkable city.  But how did our enemies reach us?  And who were they, and who sent them?  Was the guild behind the attack?  If so, why?  Lots more questions, but I’ll have to wait to get answers.<br /><br />PS. While musing on Therisdun’s motives, I had a thought.  I can’t confirm this, though I know nothing to deny it.  I believe that Therisdun is trapped within the world itself.  There is speculation that the network of nexuses exists to keep him trapped.  I wonder if he has been absorbing all of the negative nexus energy?  This could explain why balanced nexuses turned positive over time.  It could also explain why negative nexuses collapse over time, but positive nexuses seem stable.  I’m not sure how to test this, or what it means, but I shall need to keep my eyes open.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session S-19</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I want to feel proud for what we
accomplished today, but I don't know that I deserve much credit. 
When we created the balanced nexus, I was involved.  My geomancy
skills and my ability to enjoy inverted nexuses came in useful,
though my lack of actual skill or experience with handling a nexus
limited my usefulness.  But my point is, why I was involved in the
process, it was not mine.  I didn't even know this was possible, let
alone plan any of it.  I just aided with the execution.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">This gathering was supposed to be
different.  I was not asked by anyone to gather those that are here. 
It was not my idea alone, and it's need was obvious, but it was my
quest.  I was not alone, but I felt ownership over this process.  I
spoke to most of the representatives of the factions that are in
attendance.  I used my connections to gain many audiences, and with
them, many pledges of support.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I had accomplished much to be proud of.
 Then Ioun goes and calls for this gathering.  At least I was
invited.  But now I don't know how useful my actions were, now that
the gods have stepped in and taken over.  Neither I, nor any of my
companions were important enough to be recognized in any official
capacity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The meeting chamber was broken up into
different areas for each of the factions.  Ioun was apparently
responsible for determining who was a faction.   The Fochlucan
Lyricists were recognized, even though the only representative was
Sophia.  At the same time, Ed, Admatha, and Biger's organization was
not recognized.  As I said before, it would have been nice if someone
who had worked so hard to put this together had been acknowledged,
even if it wasn't me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">At least we were free to choose where
to sit.  For most, there wasn't much choice, but I had much to
consider.  I could have joined the Fey, as some of their blood runs
through my veins, and I can feel it's influence on me.  Speaking of
blood, I could have also joined the tribes, or Delphia, as they have
each welcomed me as family.  The empire is where I'm from, even if I
don't feel like it's home.  I had also established myself with the
Underdark, and would have loved to hear their whispers.  Ultimately,
my strength derives by my ability to belong anywhere, so I sat down
in front of the “Independent” section.    Though I still think I
should have had a seat at the table.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">There was quite a gathering here.  I
was happy to see the much varied factions represented in the same
room.  In a nod to formality, every attendee was introduced by name
and title.  My title was “A Free Spirit”.  I wouldn't have it any
other way.  Sure it's not as impressive sounding as most of the other
titles, but I am here on my own.  I don't belong to any faction, I'm
not anyone's leader, and I like said, I wouldn't have it any other
way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The downside to this, of course, is
that I don't really have an official voice.  Not in this conference,
nor in the council that will rule the settlements around the Nexus. 
The independent cities have their own council to manage their seat. 
I don't even remember if I get a voice on that council or not.  I
don't think I do.  It makes sense, since I don't represent a city, or
really anything.  I did speak up on their behalf a few times, but
they didn't seem that interested in pursuing any of the issues.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">That's not to say that I won't have any
influence.  I managed to bring most of the attendees to this table,
or at least I still want to believe I did.  I should be able to gain
the ear of any here.  Councils and government don't really interest
me that much.  I'm pretty sure I would get bored quickly if I had
actual responsibilities.  I guess I don't want responsibilities, or
positions, or official capacity so much as I want a little
recognition, and I want to be able to make sure that my efforts on
behalf of this nexus achieve my goals.  I'm not used to having a
cause to care about, and I just want keep it on track.  I can't just
hand it over, wipe my hands, and go to wherever the winds take me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">While all this organizational talk was
very interesting, the people audience was much more so.  Not for
anything they were saying or doing, but stories in this room were
overwhelming.  With so much here, I had a hard time focusing on any
specific individual.  That is, until I gazed upon Sidolphus.  In her
past I saw Demogorgon quite prominently.  It would have caught my
interest anyways, but after seeing him in my scry last week, I'm sure
that it was him.  I couldn't say anything in the middle of
conference, so I had to wait.  Besides, such issues are better dealt
with in private, than in front of the entire conference.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">After an eternity, the discussions
about policy and government were concluding.  Sidolphus herself stood
up and requested that we move on to talking about military tactics. 
I couldn't let this happen, and she had provided me the perfect
opportunity.  I stood up and requested a recess for continuing.  I'm
sure the gods don't care, but I was not meant to sit in one seat for
hours on end.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">The recess was granted, and I tried to
make my way to Erathis, but she was surrounded.  Not knowing where
else to turn, I went to Sibyl.  I apologized for the position I put
her in before but then got right to the point.  I told her of my
suspicion and of Erathis's popularity.  Sybil took charge and loudly
announced that she needed Erathis for a very important matter.  A
little less discrete that I prefer, but it worked.  At least if
someone has to draw attention to themselves, it shouldn't be me.  We
grabbed Sidolphus as well.  She does have a right to defend herself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I explained what I saw, and
predictably, Sidolphus denied everything.  I tried to get her to step
out, but she didn't like the idea of needing to step aside based only
on accusation.  Erathis talked to her as well, and I got a better
look.  I saw Demogorgon tossing her a plain silver band.  Of course
Sidolphus was wearing gloves.  She protested, but complied after
Erathis insisted.  The ring was invisible, but with my enhanced
vision, I could see it.  Sidolphus acted as if it weren't there, but
after activating a mechanical monocle, Erathis could see it as well. 
Sidolphus then somehow teleported away.  All I could tell is that she
was headed in the direction of Oraculum.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">We decided that we would bring this to
the groups attention.  I didn't see any other traitors, but some
things have been hidden from me before, I couldn't see everyone
really well, and this cause is too important to worry about a little
pride.  Once we reconvened Erathis announced Sidolphus's actions. 
This caused quite a stir.  It was decided that everyone take an oath
to tell the truth, and to swear that they have no alliance with
Demogorgon.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">What to do, what to do?  I've never
sworn an oath before.  Last time someone tried, I simply walked away.
 I could walk away again, but I really want to be here.  I really
want this to succeed, and I really, really don't want to be bound to
tell the truth, especially not in front of this room.  In the end, I
followed the fey and swore not to lie.  I didn't want to draw
additional suspicion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">With not a moment wasted, Admatha stood
and accused me of having a ring like Sildophus.  I quickly stood and
insisted that I did not.  The questions then quickly came from her,
Biger, and Za'har.  I could only insist that my ring was irrelevant
to the proceedings.  Now, I think the rings may be more similar than
I initially thought, but at the time, I had little reason to
associate them.  I did not receive my ring from Demogorgon.  Also,
the Lyracists also use hidden rings to communicate.  It seems like an
obvious solution, and it's not unlikely that since at least two
groups use this method, that there aren't others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">But they kept questioning me.  If they
would not believe me that my ring was irrelevant under oath, I don't
know that they would believe anything else that I said.  The validity
of my oath was even confirmed.  I had to say that I had my secrets,
just as everyone else in the room surely did.  I wanted to get back
on track, not focus secrets, mine or otherwise.  The Vanquisher, of
all people, stood up to end this nonsense.  The issue was dropped,
and discussions moved on to military matters.  I placed a silencing
effect on the ring in case they are connected and it's spying on us. 
I don't know what it can do, and I don't want to take chances.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">And I thought that the governmental
discussions were boring.  I could pledge all the forces under my
control, but as they are comprised of me, myself, and I, and I am not
a warrior, I just tried to stay awake.  I feel like I made more than
my fair contribution by ferreting out Sildolphus.  That should be
worth at least as much as legion of warriors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I wish Kith were here.  I would have
liked to discuss with him what to do.  This ring is becoming more and
more of a burden, and hasn't provided any benefits lately.  Not only
have I not been asked to do anything interesting lately, I haven't
been contacted at all.  I managed to get the magistrate into Sigil,
but even for that, I received nothing.  No reward, no thanks, not
even any acknowledgment.  In the mean time, these rings are drawing
more an more unwanted attention.  Kith hasn't said much, but he seems
wary.  It was his idea to offer them up to the ritual to create the
balanced nexus.  I wasn't sure, but I went along with it.  Not only
would that have rid us of the rings, it also exposed that we had
them.  Of course some of my companions saw my ring once they found
one on someone connected to the ordering.  And Cameron himself
exposed his and Kith's ring to the group.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I don't know what's going on with the
Guild.  I am very wary of exposing them, as I don't know who they
really are, or what they really want.  Sure, I know a few of them,
but I don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes.  They don't have
anything specific on me, but they know who I am, and they've proven
themselves to be quite resourceful and ruthless.  This is enough for
me to want to keep my mouth shut.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I wish I could talk to Kith, as
anything I say will also reflect on him.  But he's not here, and it's
up to me.  I can live with this weight on my finger, or I can try to
free myself from it.  When I look at it that way, I really have no
choice.  With this many in attendance, it's guaranteed that they will
find out about my actions.  If they have any agents in the city, any
attempt on me would expose them.  They shouldn't be able to send
anyone else into the city until this attack is resolved, so I should
be safe until then.  Kas, the forger of the sword that can slay gods,
is here, loyalties unknown.  And I have no way to know what else will
get out, or when.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">On the other hand, this is power and
interested group.  If there's anywhere I could be kept safe, it's
here.  Here goes nothing!  I stood up, walked to the table, took off
the ring and placed it on the table.  I announced to everyone that
the ring marked me as a member of the guild.  I told them what little
I knew, and answered any questions I could.  I even mentioned the
quest for Sigil.  I don't know if that was wise, but for those who
don't know, there should be enough meat to distract them.  Many
others had little pieces of information, and we discussed them for
quite some time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">I think I was vindicated for waiting to
bring this up, as the military matters were more important.  I hope
that this goes a long way to clearing any doubt about my intentions. 
I'm sure a few will still doubt me, even after I help create the
nexus, helped gather most of those here, rooted out a traitor, and
put my life on the line to expose the guild while under an oath, but
there's no reasoning with some people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in">While we were talking about the guild,
I almost regret my decision.  On one hand, they are ruthless,
secretive, and completely unwilling to include me as anything other
than an errand girl.  But on the other, they seem to want to
eliminate the gods from our world.  I'm happy to work with the gods
to achieve freeing Oraculum, but I still don't care for them or their
involvement.  I would prefer that they leave this world alone.  If I
knew more about what The Guild was up to, I may very well be on the
other side of this conflict, and that scares me.  I haven't devoted
so much of myself to any cause before this, and to think that I could
easily be opposed to it give me much cause to question what I'm
doing.  I don't really want Demogorgon here either, and at least this
way many people will have access to the balanced Nexus.  That is
right, I'm sure of it.  I just hope that this is the right way to
achieve that goal.</p>
<p><strong>Session S20</strong><br /><br />I don’t like feeling trapped.  I know this is where I’m supposed to be.  And there are lots of interesting people here.  And we are working to learn more about these rings.  And there haven’t been any attempts on my life.  But there is just something confining about being not being able to leave.  <br /><br />It’s not even that I can’t leave, it’s that I can’t return.  That’s even worse, because if I couldn’t leave, that would be the end of it.  But now, every day, every moment, I need to choose to stay here.  There’s a whole world going on out there that I’m missing out on.  And I’m not even that useful around here.  Sure, they poke and prod at my ring, but I don’t really need to be here for that.  And I’m keeping an eye out for ties to Demogorgon, but I haven’t found, nor do I really expect to find any.<br /><br />But I do want to see this through to the end, so here I stay, day after day.<br /><br />At least we did learn a few interesting things about the rings.  There seem to be several different but related sets of rings.  The Fochlucan lyricists have rings that they use for communication, but they do little else.  Guild rings can be used to send and receive messages, as well as teleport to another ring.  They also have the ability to listen in on communication between other ring bearers, including the lyricists’ rings!  There may still be other powers, but they are limited to shapeshifters or to gods.  I may be able to trick it, but any attempts could be noticed, so I haven’t yet dared.<br /><br />Beyond that, it was a quiet month.  I think most factions must have kept to themsevles.  Amazingly, no real fighting broke out between them.  I don’t know if it was the gods, wisdom, or pure isolation that kept the peace, but it was probably a little of each.<br /><br />Non too soon the day of the battle arrived.  My initial plan was to stay back in the city and use a combination of scrying, messaging, and divination to aid our side.  But once I saw all the many troops arranged and ready for battle, I just couldn’t resist.  I’ve never gotten to fight in anything on this scale before.  I was going to fight with a unit of Delphian geomancers.  Figure I may learn a trick or two, or teach a trick or two.  Either way, that’s where I felt I would fit best.  <br /><br />Once Kord rushed forward to establish the front line, I just couldn’t resist.  I needed to be in the thick of things, not back with a bunch of other geomancers.  I enhanced my movement and rushed to join him.  Biger also rushed up and covered my flank.  Joseph and others joined on the other side.  Kord cut down demon after demon, unit after unit.  His revelry was palpable, and a little contagious.  <br /><br />I didn’t intend to stay long, but, to my surprise, I was actually not terrible.  I managed to take out a few units, and not get too badly hurt.  Using a mixture of illusions, invisibility, short teleports, and a few other tricks, they had no idea where I was, or where I would be.  After a while they just started swinging wildly.  While a few lucky swings managed to give me a scratch or two, overall, they didn’t know what hit them.<br /><br />After fighting for a while, a few major players showed up on each side.  The fey appeared with a few ekinoch and platapod units arrived.  A few gods showed up in support of Demogorgon’s defense as well.  Biger turned one of his cranks which resulted in a huge blast, and the formation of a nexus on the battlefield!<br /><br />The fight continues...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Session F21</strong></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The demons kept pouring out of
Oraculum.  Wave after wave after wave.  I have to admit that fighting
on my own was exhilarating.  But I'm not built for this.  Time to
join another unit and try my hand at leading.  The geomancers are
behind me, but the echinochs have just joined the field.  I miss
then, and I'd love to see them in action.  I helped them cover the
backs of the platopods.  We took out a few demon units while the
platopds tore down the wall.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We fought our way into the city, and
then into Demogorgons lair.  Many of those who I had traveled with
managed to gather inside the lair.  Za'har took center stage.  He
gathered power reaching back ten thousand years and struck a killing
blow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In that moment, visions were released. 
Za'har and Demogorgon have fought together before.  They had both
opposed the Moradin and the extinction of the humans.  I didn't know
Za'har was old enough to be a part of that battle.  I wonder if the
other humans with us were as well?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But the more interesting part is
Demogorgon.  He/she/it/they/whatever is someone I had seen before. 
In the images from Sigil, there was a woman who flew to the top of
the tower, became two, and then collapsed the tower as the ring fell.
 This woman was Demogorgon, or became Demogorgon, or..  ?  I'm not
sure exactly who she was, or how one becomes a demon, let alone one
so powerful.  There must be quite a story there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Maybe I can get something from Za'Har. 
Beyond that, the road leads back to Sigil.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong><br /></strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Between Chapters 2 and 3</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Demogogon was defeated.  I received a
few visions I really wanted to follow up on.  The remaining demons
were being handled, banished, left on their own...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As soon as I had stepped away from the
crowd, they appeared.  A green bolt came at me, but managed to notice
it and get out of the way.  I had to get out of there.  People of
every race and nationality were everywhere.  Any of them could be
members of the guild waiting to strike.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Wilds.  That's the only place I
don't know that they can find me.  I teleported back to the Echinochs
that I fought with.  I should be safe surrounded by them.  I wish our
reunion could have been happier, but it is what it is.  I traveled
back to the wilds with them.  I should be safe there for a little
while.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What can I do?  I can't hide out here
forever.  I hate being rattled.  I need to do something.  I can't
stay out here forever.  I may be safe while I'm here, but I can't
even be sure about that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">….</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I wish my stay could be more pleasant. 
Despite the dangerous surroundings, my previous visit was dominated
by curiosity and anticipation.  Fear and apprehension make a poor
substitute.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There are other things that I should be
worried about.  What is Za'har?  I know who he is now, but what was
he before.  The same goes double for Demogogon.  How are they
related?  What is Asmodeus up to?  Why were other deities aiding
Demogogon, and what kind of conflict will result?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then, of course, how fares Oraculum? 
Did the factions managed to maintain order, or did they devolve into
fighting amongst themselves?  Has Oraculum been repaired and moved
yet?  And what about my companions?  I don't want to be discovered,
so I don't dare contact anyone.  I'm sure they are watching each of
them.  Speaking of, what is the guild upto?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I have an idea.  I wonder if I can use
this ring against them?  After several months of research, I think I
may have it.  If this works, then the enchantment placed on the right
will hide it and it's wearer from anyone wearing a ring.  Hide isn't
the best word for it.  It should cause my ring to be 'out of phase'
with the others.  I shouldn't exist in their reality.  I don't know
if they'll exist in mine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now with this ring, I'm going to need a
new identity as well.  I have one that I haven't played yet, so they
shouldn't know about it.  Time to become Meliae, a nymph and Ehlonna's representative in Oracculum.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Only one way to find out.  Now to find
Kith. &nbsp;As best I can tell, he is sometimes in Oracculum, so that is where I will start my search.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session S21</strong></p><p>I'm glad to see that Oraculum is still standing.  They have moved the city itself, freeing access to the nexus.  I wouldn't describe everything as sunshine and roses, but the disagreements seem manageable, especially now that I'm here.<br /><br />I'm here.  We'll, I'm not me, I'm Meliae, the forest nymph and representative of the Fey.  I hate to say that I'm afraid, but I am.  I'm not going to keep hiding in the wilds, but I am still hiding behind this mask.  Even if it is risky coming out into the world again, I cannot remain a slave to my fear.  I would like to say that this disguise is only prudent, and it will hopefully have additional uses, but I know that my fear is still behind it.  <br /><br />And for all this hiding, it appears to be doing me little good.  I'm not in town for but a day, and Kas send out a summons.  I survived the night with out incident, so that's something.  I'm sure I caught many an eye, though I have no reason to expect that any saw through to who I really am.  Kas is enough to cause me to worry, so I'll keep my guard up.<br /><br />Next morning, we met in the Cafe.  There was someone (well something) else at the table.  One of the shapeshifters appearing as a gnome and going by Glee.  I could see it, and it seemed like it could see me.  She was wearing a ring.  <br /><br />Test failed I guess.  Maybe if I tried using the balanced nexus, maybe I could allow my ring to hide from theirs.  I keep mine under a glove, and I hope my disguise will help.  But I'd rather not share the same slice as the guild.<br /><br />Anyways, Glee was scared.  She was nervous to see us, and not sure why we were there.  Avandra and Kord also sat down at a table near by.  Then the Raven Queen, surrounded by her chains decided to drop by.  She wasn't here to take a seat and order a coffee.  The chains lashed out around Glee and chocked the life out of her rather quickly.  Kord stood up and fiddled with a chain link around his wrist, but to no avail.  Another god was behind her orders.  Before much else happened, Glee was a husk, and the Raven Queen departed.<br /><br />Kas appears to have been expecting this.  In deed, this is why we were called here in the first place.  I guess I haven't gotten to the 'we' part yet.  Admatha and Biger were also invited to see this little spectacle.  I don't know who else was invited, but Kas didn't seem to be waiting for anyone else, and we did fill the table.<br /><br />The crowd was beginning to react.  Kord lept on a table to try and calm things down.  Kordt was like one wind blowing against another, trying to create stillness.  Kord attempted to question Kas, but the noise was too great.  He then teleported us back to the hotel way stayed at before the siege.  He demanded a room at the front desk.  <br /><br />Once inside, the real discussion began. &nbsp;Kord didn’t stay long.  Avandra was happy to stay and learn a few things.  Kas..  now Kas is the real question.  But I’ll get to that.


	</p><p>We learned a lot in this little discussion.  Of maybe Kas told us a lot.  Then again, there was a lot she didn’t say.  We learned about the gods and their eidolons.  We learned about how Sigil was built to control the chaos of the flow.  How the flow stems from the chained god’s prison.  She told us that Asmodeus and Demogorgon are linked, or at least they were when they were created.


	</p><p>We learned that the Lady of Pain was created to take over some of the grudge work from the existing gods.  Many gods fed power into her.  From that Nerull was also created.  I’m still not clear exactly how that works, but I’m sure I can find out if it matters.


	</p><p>The real question is, who is Kas?  She opposes the old gods who trapped Therisdun.  She opposes Asmodeus, but indirectly.  She talks as if she had intimate knowledge of what happened long ago.  She definately has an agenda, and has goals, but the only one she is willing to reveal is a desire for revenge on the old gods for their follies.


	</p><p>But of course, I can’t read a thing off of her.  Then again, neither can Ioun.  Most of what he knows of her, he knows by omission.  The only way she could have kept her past hidden from even him for so long was if the allfather himself was involved.  She might be his Eidolon, but we can only speculate.


	</p><p>We talked about trying to draw Asmodeus out of the shadows.  Kas suggested raiding the oldest and deepest hell and steal what we could.  Maybe the other Dragon Orb, maybe some other items of power.  Then we would have to defend them from her minions until she had to stick her neck out to try and retrieve them.  I will say I’m not excited about this plan, especially since Kas doesn’t want to get involved.  Nor does she particularly want to say why.


	</p><p>Asmodeus could be a dire threat.  Or she could take advantage of different techniques to remove possibilities from the flow to become a dire threat.  I’ve experienced this once before, where what had happened was ripped from reality as we were shifted to another world by a quake.  A rather unique quake, at least I hope it’s unique.  But someone or something caused that, and we must find out who and why, and how.


	</p><p>The ordering is another way to achieve this, but that’s an affect around a nexus instead of an instantaneous that changed the past.  Both are scary.  I’m not even sure which is more scary, though there is more I do not understand about the quake.  We haven’t figured out how to reverse to fix an ordered nexus yet either.


	</p><p>How did I end up on Asmodeus?  Kas seems to be a master of guiding discussions as much as ‘being in the right place at the right time.’  There’s always something around to divert attention from her.  She’s a wily one, and I must keep an eye on her.

	</p><p>I had mentioned Ioun before.  What I haven’t mentioned was that he had come to me in a dream to discuss Kas, or discuss what he knows because of what he doesn’t know about her.  The whole situation makes me nervous.  Her unknown ties to the guild and the changelings doesn’t help.


	</p><p>She had some form of trust from Glee.  They had used her sword.  She knew who I was.  I have to trust that if she wanted me dead, she wouldn’t have bothered with the show, or the discussion.  Sure I know some things, but I doubt I know much that she doesn’t.  I doubt she did all of that to pump me for information.  This would make me feel safer if Admatha didn’t also recognize me.  Though if she wanted me dead, she wouldn’t have let on.


	</p><p>Damn fear.  Once this identity is established as separate from my own, and after I can figure out what I can actually do with this ring, I’m going to have to stick my neck out, and see if I can draw them out.  I don’t think I’m going to be learning much about them any other way.  Kas may know, but I got the impression that the gods themselves don’t know much.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session S22 </strong></p><p>We met Asmodeus in person.&nbsp; She welcomed our arrival into her domain.&nbsp; She even invited some of her closest friends to greet us!&nbsp; We were hoping to be a little more discrete.&nbsp; The red carpet and party favors were a little much.&nbsp; She needed have bothered.&nbsp; I would have settled for a nice cup a tea and a nice little tour.&nbsp; Heck, I’d even show myself around.&nbsp; I’d be a good guest, clean up after myself and all that.&nbsp; She would hardly know we were here.<br /><br />But no, someone had to go and tip her off.&nbsp; Okay, enough with the imagery.&nbsp; Really, we fell for a trap, or two.&nbsp; But even now, I’m not sure where we made our misstep.&nbsp; Maybe this whole trip was a fool’s errand.&nbsp; Many of the tribal leaders had been missing for some time, since before we reclaimed Oraculum.&nbsp; I can understand, and even sympathize with the desire to get them back.&nbsp; <br /><br />If this was a part of the trap, it was laid a long time ago.&nbsp; Even if this was planned a long time ago, it was either lead by prophesy, or just a move that would possibly help in the future.&nbsp; But if that were the case, who’s move was it?&nbsp; Knowing the devils’ intentions is impossible.&nbsp; I get the impression that they play their games, that their loyalties are all about apearances.&nbsp; Maybe that is the truth, and the conflict is only skin deep?<br /><br />Maybe we picked the wrong city?&nbsp; We had a choice of two unknown ordered cities.&nbsp; We did find the leaders, so maybe we did choose the right city.&nbsp; Who knows what we would have found in the other city.&nbsp; Maybe another trap?&nbsp; At least we freed the tribal leaders that weren’t too far transformed.&nbsp; Now I don’t know if they made it out of the city, though the other three that traveled with us were also grabbed, encased, and were released, so hopefully they made it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Maybe we shouldn’t have entered the tower?&nbsp; If we didn’t go in, we wouldn’t have found the tribal leaders.&nbsp; If we didn’t go in, there would have been no real point to the trip.&nbsp; Sure, it was like entering the lion’s maw, but that’s where the excitement hides.&nbsp; There’s no way we could have avoided entering the tower.<br /><br />Maybe we shouldn’t have made the deal?&nbsp; But how could we not.&nbsp; We could have walked away.&nbsp; But again, walking away isn’t what we do.&nbsp; We could have challenged him, but that seems rather foolish.&nbsp; It’s never a good idea to fight someone in their stronghold.&nbsp; Doubly so when the halls are lined with iron “statues”.&nbsp; No, no, we couldn’t have walked away, and fighting wasn’t a good option.&nbsp; So I thought of a deal.&nbsp; He releases those who will leave, and we take his portal to Asmodeus’s realm.&nbsp; I offered the idea to Za’har and he ran with it.&nbsp; At any result, offered, he countered, and we accepted.<br /><br />Or maybe this is where we’re supposed to be, and then is when we’re supposed to be here.&nbsp; I don’t see what we really could have done differently.&nbsp; Maybe we’re too tangled in this web to see the way out?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session F22</strong></p><p><br />Then again, maybe fighting Asmodeus on her home turf is not where I’m supposed to be.&nbsp; Or at least not yet.&nbsp; I’m not sure what happened.&nbsp; There was no quake, or even chains this time.&nbsp; So the question here is obvious, but the answer is not, at least to me.&nbsp; It may be interesting, and I would like to know what it is, but I have other matters to attend to, like surviving.&nbsp; <br /><br />I found myself back in Oraculum.&nbsp; Maybe I’m getting another shot at this?&nbsp; I received a glimpse of what awaits us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Anyways, this day has started like all the others since I returned to Oraculum, with someone sending me a message.&nbsp; This time it’s not Kas, or Sybil, but Arwel.&nbsp; At least I’m still popular.&nbsp; Even more important, she claims to have Kith with her.&nbsp; I can only hope that this is accurate, and someone’s not playing with me.&nbsp; Since I can’t be sure, I’m not responding to it, but I have to check it out.<br /><br />I made my way to the address provided, and kept my eye out.&nbsp; I saw Arwel cooking breakfast for herself and Kith.&nbsp; Za’har and Biger arrived shortly thereafter.&nbsp; This must be the place.&nbsp; After a knock, knock on the door, they let me in.&nbsp; Of course, I’m still playing as Meliae.&nbsp; Even in this group, I don’t feel comfortable revealing my identity, but Za’har and Biger appear to also remember the events that landed us in hell, and with that, my identity.<br /><br />But Kith is the one I need to see.&nbsp; I offered him my hand, so we could go somewhere private, and while he was dazzled by my looks, he didn’t recognize me, nor did he trust me.&nbsp; I don’t know if my charm is wearing off, well, that may be true, but Kith has been around a long time, had a very charismatic foe, and should be wary.&nbsp; With Biger and Za’har’s reasurance, he accepted my offer.<br /><br />I teleported the two of us to the ironwood tree in the Fay’s claim.&nbsp; While we weren’t alone, we were at least surrounded by those I would trust more, and hopefully the same is true for Kith.&nbsp; Even so, I couldn’t bring myself to state my name plainly, so I had to suggest who I was to him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Thanks to all this rigamarole, he though I didn’t trust him.&nbsp; While I shouldn’t be surprised, I’m not exactly the trusting type at the moment, but I am saddened that he, of all people, would doubt me.&nbsp; I could be more open if it were just the two of us, but there’s always someone else around, or someone watching.&nbsp; And the guild could be anywhere, could be anyone, or could have recruited anyone, or be magically watching or listening.&nbsp; <br /><br />I hate all this paranoia.&nbsp; I still feel trapped.&nbsp; Hopefully this will all be over soon.&nbsp; Kith received a vision or a dream.&nbsp; He has one last shot to save, or preserve, or reconstruct, or something positive I don’t quite understand to Melora.&nbsp; Melora is more important to Kith than anything else.&nbsp; I can’t not help him.&nbsp; The guild is also involved, but here again I’m getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />While I was with Kith at the ironwood tree, I had a chance to test out my ring.&nbsp; Looks like it works!&nbsp; I can’t just turn it off or on like a switch, I need to concentrate on it.&nbsp; It also seems to work on those wearing the weaker rings.&nbsp; This will help me breathe a little easier.<br /><br />Back to Melora.&nbsp; She was the dissenter, the one of the twenty-one to vote against Therisdune’s imprisonment.&nbsp; She walked away from that council, but approached Bacab with evidence of the repercussions.&nbsp; She noticed that the land was dying in what would eventually become the wastes.&nbsp; One thing led to another, she she was eliminated.&nbsp; <br /><br />The shapeshifters which comprise the guild seem to have absorbed part of her essence, at least that which is left.&nbsp; Kith claims they have corrupted it.&nbsp; That Melora was about justice and mercy, not vengeance.&nbsp; Kith has more reason to hate the twenty than most, but he can’t support their elimination.&nbsp; I am very relieved that we are on the same side on this.<br /><br />Off to Terminus, Kalanon’s city.&nbsp; Za’har, Biger, and I still had the ironwood suits.&nbsp; Kith hid a portable hole that Za’har carries.&nbsp; Arwel is happy to take the risk.&nbsp; I scried ahead, and it seems like the barrier has not advanced, though something was cutting my glance short.&nbsp; <br /><br />We teleported in a hundred feet out.&nbsp; The lineship was still forming a tunnel through the barrier.&nbsp; On our approach, Za’har disappeared.&nbsp; Kith was left behind with us at least.&nbsp; I stripped myself from the armor so that I can see and move more freely.<br /><br />Just inside the city, there was mob forming, and about to strike.&nbsp; The mob was comprised of shapeshifters, all of them.&nbsp; There were about a dozen of them, and all but one had a ring.&nbsp; Silius Vartarra was the exception, and in more ways than one.&nbsp; He was also the only one not to change into something else.&nbsp; He’s also more scrambled.&nbsp; His formless shape is more chaotic than the rest.<br /><br />The mob was about to strike at Kalanon and few of his allies.&nbsp; I couldn’t see who they were through the mob, but I’m guessing they’re friendlier than the shapeshifters.&nbsp; As the guild all morphed into fearsome creatures, I changed back to my natural form.&nbsp; I yelled out to them to draw their attention.&nbsp; I drew three of them, and they rushed at me.&nbsp; I popped over to Arwel for protection.<br /><br />As the fighting continued, my ring came in handy.&nbsp; It kept me separate from all of shapeshifters except for Silius.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it also kept me separate from both Kith and Arwel.&nbsp; I hope Biger has a little time to give me some directions.<br /><br />I slowly made my way towards Silius.&nbsp; Before I could reach him, some huge snake creature rose up out of the ground behind Kalanon’s allies.&nbsp; If I had my guess, it’s another lord of hell, looking to stake a claim.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can it get any messier.&nbsp; I’m not even sure this is preferable to our last abridged face off in hell.&nbsp; Maybe we failed again.&nbsp; Maybe I’m about to get shunted to a new timeline back in Oraculum.&nbsp; Or maybe, this is where I’m supposed to be?&nbsp; If we succeed here, we can turn back a lord of hell, eliminate or deeply would the guild, and save Melora.&nbsp; All noble goals, and possibly more important rummaging through Asmodeus’s drawers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Session S23 Journal</strong></p><p>Now I'm back in Asmodeus's arena?&nbsp; It's like I never left.&nbsp; But I did leave, or at least I think I did.&nbsp; I met with Kith, and Arwel, and Za'har (who should be here but isn't).&nbsp; We went to visit Kalanon, and found a significant number of the guild facing off against him.&nbsp; But here I am, back in hell, facing yet another battle.<br /><br />Maybe I'm here for insight.&nbsp; I didn't contribute much to the battle.&nbsp; I tried a few things to distract the hulking mass of bodies with swords poking out at all directions.&nbsp; But Joseph entered the fray, and pulled a giant Terasque out of himself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Right, insight.&nbsp; Since I couldn't do much to aid in the actual fighting, I kept my eye on Asmodeus.&nbsp; She's a wily one.&nbsp; For all of the entertainment we were providing her audience, she seemed happy to direct her attentions elsewhere.&nbsp; Sounds like it was the place I just was in fact.&nbsp; She's directing her minion to attack the shape shifters instead of “the dragon”, which I can only assume means Kalanon.<br /><br />She's also directing some form of geomancy effect through her scry.&nbsp; I can only assume I'll be back there once this is over.&nbsp; I wonder if I'll be able to counter that in any way.&nbsp; We shall see.<br /><br />Back in the battle, the Terasque attacked the hecatoncheireis.&nbsp; It's mental insults died down once it realized it had a sizable foe to face.&nbsp; I tried to make it dance, but I needn't have bothered.&nbsp; It already had a dance partner.<br /><br />Ed also joined the battle.&nbsp; He has gained some chain like augment.&nbsp; From the Raven Queen no doubt.&nbsp; He struck a few blows to help take down the monstrosity, but not before it summoned another.&nbsp; Rather than continuing the fight, he used his chains to steal the dragon orb from atop of Asmodeus's thrown.<br /><br />She looked pissed, dropped the barrier for a moment, and entered the fray.&nbsp; At least one thing Dispoter told us was true.&nbsp; She does value that orb.&nbsp; Ed was on her in a moment, attacking with a flurry of blows, the ferocity of which I hope to never witness again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Of course I would be remiss if I didn't mention Mephistopheles' entrance.&nbsp; As soon as Asmodeus entered the arena, he appeared and replaced the barrier.&nbsp; The support of the devil's were split, and I can only imagine the chaos.&nbsp; I would have liked to watch for a few seconds longer, but we had more important matters in front of us.<br /><br />Asmodeus retreated behind a barrier of force, and we fled with the orb.&nbsp; We flee inside the temple of Sigil, or what passes for it on this world.&nbsp; Once inside, Ed tries to copy what Vance had done, but to no avail.&nbsp; Dariel and I use the essence we have to start a reaction and open a portal.&nbsp; A deep voice says “you should hurry”.&nbsp; We were working on it!<br /><br />We go through the portal and find ourselves within Bahamut's realm.&nbsp; It's a crystal encrusted cave.&nbsp; Quite pretty actually.&nbsp; He takes the dragon orb, and we being to ask him a few questions, but apparently I'm still needed elsewhere.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Session F23</strong></p><p>

	--&gt;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I feel like I'm living on both sides of
a mirror.  I find myself back in Tat'enda, exactly where I was
before.  There must be two of me, and my consciousness experiences a
little of each before syncing back up.  Or maybe this is just an
artifact of Asmodeus's realm?  Last time I was in a hell, I could
feel multiple versions of myself collapse into one, but this is a
little different.  Maybe this version of me refused to be collapsed,
or maybe it's desire to be a part of me is so strong that I can
experience time in each?  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I don't know, and I don't think I have
any way to tell.  I get the feeling that this will be short lived. 
The last time I left my other self was in Bahamut's realm, and I
expect that this path will also lead there.  Again, phooey on the
black priestess's words.  But when each self does meet, will there be
two of me, or only one.  I have heard stories of meeting themselves,
but that is areas infused with the flow.  Prime is no such place.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The battle itself continued to rage, as
if nothing had happened.  I knew Asmodeus would be influencing the
fight in some way, but I wasn't sure how?  We are in an ordered area
after all, and Kalanon is here.  I know she's a god and everything,
but in this place, so is he.  Or at least I thought.  Kalanon took
the form of a very powerful dragon, and fought valiantly.  The guild
were trying to kill him, and the devils took a shot, but soon turned
their attention to the guild on Asmodeus's command.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Arwel and Biger didn't last long
themselves.  They survived, but there was something in the devil's
initial strike which took them out of the fight.  I only caught a
glimpse of Biger's fall.  Arwel was wearing her Lyrists ring, so I
can only assume she fell the same way.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Za'har rejoined us.  He was with us
before we enetered Tat'enda, but then he wasn't there, and here he is
again.  I don't know if the barrier was delaying him somehow, or if
something else was at play.  I can't believe that he was hiding back
for some nefarious purpose. He has proven his honor time and time
again.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">His might proved substantial, but I was
able to aid it with what essence I had left from Dariel.  Even here
(or maybe because of here), I could feel the flow of things, and even
give it a nudge, here and there.  I hesitate to use the word 'flow',
as it feels different than The Flow, but no other word comes to mind.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Just to prove that this reality is tied
to the other, Kalanon changed from an emerald dragon to a copper
dragon.  The change did not revitalize him however, and as the fight
wore on, Kalanon looked about ready to drop.  I didn't want to see
him die.  I know he did some terrible things, but I think he's come
to his senses.  I really want to get a chance to talk to him about
what happened.  I also hope that he can help right his wrongs,
especially now that two other devil lords have taken up residence in
the other ordered cities.  Hopefully he also has an explanation for
why the ordering effect seems to be growing in the other cities.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Anyways, I need him to survive.  I
walked over to him and managed to convince him to leave the battle. 
It was starting to dwindle.  Most of the guild had been slain
including their leader, many of the devils were gone, but the devil
lord remained.  Remained near full strength, and potentially with
Asmodeus's support for a few moments longer.  I couldn't risk it, so
I teleported the two of us just outside of the lineship once he
calmed down and changed back to his normal self.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We saw a giant cat run by us.  I can
only assume that it was a guild member fleeing.  Maybe things were
looking better.  We wondered back in, and to my surprise, Za'har and
Kith were able to nearly take down the devil lord.  Kalanon said he
would attune the ordering to us, and I let loose with a small burst
of sonic energy which finished the devil off.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I can't neglect Kith.  He is, after
all, the real reason we are here.  I'm more than happy to decimate
the guild and win back my freedom, but he's here after something he
values more than I value my freedom.  He was told that this was his
last opportunity to save his goddess Melora.  Even if I had nothing
to gain, I couldn't withhold my meager aid from his quest.  If we
were at cross purposes, I would be torn, so I am glad it was not
such.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Kith still carries Kas's sword, though
the guild leader also swung an axe made out of the same material.  I
couldn't see or interact with Kith in the early parts of the battle,
as he still wears his guild ring.  Midway through the battle, I had
too many concerns to keep hiding, and Za'Har indicated I was in a
“safe” location.  I saw Kith slay the guild leader, another foe,
and strike into the axe.  I also saw him get wrapped up in the devil
lord's tail.  I was busy trying to save Kalanon, and I know Kith has
survived worse, so I left him to Za'Har.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Once the devil lord dropped, Kith
spread his little hands over (as best he could) his body and managed
to draw the taint from him.  A more celestial being arose in his
place.  We had much to discuss, though Kith's sword was nearly
overflowing with energy, and we wished a better place for it.  Za'Har
mentioned a world of balance, which sounds interesting to me, but we
needed to get to Sigil.  Thankfully more people can teleport these
days, and we were able to make it there much more quickly than last
time.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Once inside, Za'Har performed a strange
ritual that I don't think I could mimic (at least to any effect)
which opened a portal to the balanced world.  Once there, Kith sword
became Melora.  I couldn't be happier for Kith for finally rejoining
her after all these millennia.  I'm glad I could be a part of it, and
be there to see it.  Kith, or course, thanked us all for helping, and
especially me.  He did have a slight fear that destroying the guild
would displease me, but nothing could be further from the truth.  He
might have even suggested that I might want to lead it.  Now I know
he's delirious with joy and excitement.  The only thing I've ever
wanted to lead is me.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We had much to discuss.  I learned that
Therisune's madness was a result of his imprisonment, or at the very
least, came after.  This was his punishment for the humans' ambition.
 Kith has been around since that time, though I am much younger.  His
misery is a result of the gods' folly, though I owe my entire
existence to it.  That doesn't mean I have to agree with their
actions.  My first thought is that there must be a version of the
world where they didn't bind him, but then I remember that that's not
possible.  This all occurred before the flow.  In this case, the flow
exists because they did this.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then I start to think that maybe this
is still one shard, and that there is a flow beyond it, that even
this action was a part of.  But even if that's true, and I doubt it
is, I don't know how to access that world.  The only people I've met
that I couldn't place in this world completely were Kith and Joseph. 
Kith, because he is originally from a place called Prime.  It's where
the gods themselves dwell, and exists outside the flow.  Joseph I'm
still not sure of.  I tried asking Melora, but I heard nothing
definitive.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We have an unbelievable wealth of
information available to us now.  Melora is remembering bits and
pieces of information known to the guild.  Also our newly
celestialized companion is happy to share what he remembers of
Asmodeus's plotting.  I have many questions, and I'm sure others will
as well.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What's next?  I'm not sure.  I didn't
meet up with my other self in Bahamut's lair.  Maybe this self has
more yet to do?  At the very least, I should gather the others who
have traveled with us on this crazy adventure, and bring them here. 
Hopefully others have learned wonderful things, or made great
progress in this fight.  We failed to do more than damange Asmodeus,
so she is still a threat.  And there is the great Therisdune question
to figure out.  Can his madness be quelled?  Can he be let free
without destroying the world?  Did Asmodeus let us escape so we can
do this, then once the flow is gone, she can create one last hell?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Time will tell.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><strong>Session F24a</strong></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br />What should I do?&nbsp; Sahrit is about to sacrifice two unwilling babies to perform a ritual to unorder this nexus.&nbsp; <br /><br />On one hand, performing this ritual would “fix” this nexus.&nbsp; I could go on at length about why this is a good thing, but it’s not the core issue.&nbsp; Sure, if it weren’t necessary, then the rest of this is easy, but it is necessary, and this is hard for me.<br /><br />We’ve been given a golden opportunity to fix this nexus.&nbsp; The devil lord who resides here lead all of his devils through the nexus into the abyss.&nbsp; So not only can we fix the nexus without having to fight through a sea of devils, we can possibly trap one of the lords of hell in the abyss.<br /><br />These are all great things, and I’m all for them.&nbsp; Well, I guess I’m almost all for them.&nbsp; If I were all for them, then I wouldn’t have doubts over the cost.&nbsp; And that cost may just be too high for me to accept.&nbsp; <br /><br />The cost is the lives of two babies.&nbsp; Most of my companions seem to think that this cost is nothing compared to the benefits.&nbsp; The lives of two babies is cheap compared to the number of lives that could be lost as the ordered area continues to expand, to say nothing of the effort required to reach the nexus if the devils return.<br /><br />I would agree that two lives are a small price to pay for what we have to gain.&nbsp; My concern is that they are unwilling sacrifices.&nbsp; They’re not even old enough to be willing sacrifices.&nbsp; They have no idea of what’s going on.&nbsp; They may not even be aware of their own deaths.&nbsp; But that doesn’t remove the fact that they are here unwillingly.<br /><br />Why is willingness such a sticking point?&nbsp; I don’t believe in many sins.&nbsp; I feel that people are free to chose their own path, and others are free to react however they wish.&nbsp; I enjoy playing with people.&nbsp; I lie, cheat, and manipulate them for my own amusement and benefit.&nbsp; But they always had a choice.&nbsp; They chose to believe me, or decided that seeing my smile was worth the price.&nbsp; Even soldiers on the battlefield are there as a result of choices that they made, so I have no issue with the killing that takes place.&nbsp; <br /><br />But these babies are different.&nbsp; They are not old enough to understand or to choose.&nbsp; While this is true for just about every aspect of their lives right now, it falls to others to make the right choices for them.&nbsp; Since I share some of that responsibility simply from my presence, I cannot in good conscience allow them to be sacrificed.<br /><br />Before we reached this point, we secured agreements from the gods of death to watch for and protect the departed souls.&nbsp; This covers some ground to potentially reduce the price, but it’s speculative.&nbsp; No one knows exactly what will happen to the souls during the ritual.&nbsp; I applaud the effort, but trying to minimize a wrong isn’t the same as not committing it in the first place.<br /><br />Surely all this theoretical morals crap is less important than ending the ordering.&nbsp; Even to this I would have to agree, but again, except for one thing.&nbsp; It doesn’t end here.&nbsp; The price for sin is never paid in full.&nbsp; Our current situation was caused by side effects of Therisun’s imprisonment, which was a payment against human ambition.&nbsp; This is another opportunity to end things cleanly, or simply transform and postpone payment for another day.<br /><br />I don’t know what could happen as a result of this ritual.&nbsp; We’re dealing with an untested ritual, unwilling sacrifices, and poorly understood but very damaging nexus behavior, what could go wrong?&nbsp; The flow, the clashing of Eidolons and the creation of the hells are all unintended and unforeseeable results.&nbsp; I don’t know what could result from this, nor should I be expected to.&nbsp; There will be ramifications, and the sin will need to be paid for.&nbsp; No one, not even the gods, can say with any certainty or credibility that nothing bad, or even worse will come out of this.<br /><br />Okay, enough of that.&nbsp; I can’t be a part of this cycle of sin.&nbsp; There has to be a better way.&nbsp; The current timing is very fortunate, but that doesn’t mean that it’s the best opportunity.&nbsp; In fact, I could even argue that it’s a little too convenient.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have to solve this problem, but it doesn’t have to be right now.&nbsp; Yes, the ordered areas are expanding, but at a very slow rate.&nbsp; It will displace smaller settlements on many worlds, but at the current rate, it won’t approach a city for many years.&nbsp; Many years that we could use to find a better solution.<br /><br />Then there is the devil lord.&nbsp; Trapping him in the abyss is just delaying that problem as well, instead of dealing with it.&nbsp; It’s yet another way that converting this nexus may haunt us.&nbsp; It won’t be easy now, but I doubt it will be any easier later.&nbsp; At least if he tries to return soon, he should be weakened from his trials in the abyss, instead of having time to regain strength and rebuild.<br /><br />I see the temptation, but I cannot allow this to happen.&nbsp; Kith is the only one there who sees this the same way.&nbsp; When we split into groups, each of us was the key geomancer required to make this work.&nbsp; We had agreed that we wouldn’t allow this to happen.&nbsp; No one in the discussions felt like addressing our concerns before we left, so I wouldn’t feel too bad about disappointing them.&nbsp; Unfortunately Sahrit can take my place.&nbsp; He’s recreated the instructions, and created his own vessel.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel is with us, and seems okay with this plan as well.&nbsp; I get the feeling that he’s willing to do this because there is no other way, but that he doesn’t relish it.&nbsp; Also, I expect him to not interfere in the conflict between myself and Sahrit, except to hopefully stop things from going to far.&nbsp; Though I don’t know any of this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel is at least watching over the Eidolon we found and freed from the nexus.&nbsp; She is scared, and my attempts to calm her down didn’t do much to help.&nbsp; Sahrit teleporting to us didn’t help.&nbsp; I let her go, as I couldn’t delay any longer.&nbsp; Hopefully she sees that I’m not trying to trap her.&nbsp; I want to take her with me when I leave, but I don’t know if I’ll get that option.&nbsp; My first concern is to stop this ritual.</p>

</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It's very tempting to start this
journal with the simple question “What did I do?”  Or maybe “What
did we do?” would be more appropriate.  But in either case, the
answer is simple: we failed.  At least in principle.  I would like to
say that our failure was limited to finding a better way to fix an
ordered nexus, but that hardly encompasses the scope of our failure.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Just about anything that could be done
to mitigate the sins required to revert the nexuses were taken.  We
managed to reduce the number of sacrifices per nexus from two to one.
 We arranged deals with the gods of death to protect the departed
souls of the sacrificed.  We even verified that the soul survived the
ritual.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Others were also comforted by the idea
that these children were bred for this, or that they had every
expectation of a short as miserable life.  But this point disturbs me
even more.  If this is all true, then the future of these children
was stolen long before Kith drew his dagger.  Who could steal their
futures, and for what purpose?  I have some ideas, but they are for
another time.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For now, the important point is that
they were available, and we used them.  I still don't agree with what
we did, but we did it.  Trying to prevent Sahrit from performing the
ritual was a daunting, but possible task, though I would likely have
had to kill him, and like I said, possible, but not likely.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Before it came to that, a portal
opened, and everyone else joined us.  Then everyone started talking
at once.  Ed wanted to prevent a fight between Sahrit and myself. 
Za'har was impatient that I was holding up the ritual that “we had
agreed to do”.  Sure, Kith and I agreed to come, but as none of our
concerns were addressed....  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Anyways, lots of discussion took place.
 This didn't give us a lot of time to find an alternative, but it did
give Kith and I a chance to talk, and it did show us that we lacked
any other options.  Any attempts at reason had already fallen on deaf
ears.  The only way to prevent this would have been to eliminate any
other geomancers in the group.  Together, we may have been able to
take out Sahrit before being pummeled by everyone else, but there may
be others in the group.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Even if we succeeded in stopping them
here, Kith sacrificed one child at the previous nexus.  The situation
had already been tainted.  Dariel had even put Kith and I in contact
with Kalanon, where we tried to find a way to replace the unwilling
baby with a willing sacrifice.  But it's not the soul that's needed. 
Death is side effect, not a required part of the ritual.  Those who
ordered the nexuses died because the process was too exhausting, not
because the ritual required it.  Likewise, the child must die to
release the nexus contained within, not because his soul has any
value in the ritual.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Telling Kith that we should proceed was
a very strange experience.  I felt like I was watching someone else
speak from my mouth.  I didn't feel compelled, I just couldn't
believe that I was agreeing to this, and even advocating it.  But we
agreed to do the ritual.  Dariel provided an influx of balanced
energy required balance the nexus in the child.  Kith and I took care
of the rest.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Kith feels horrible about it, and I
definitely share his burden.  He not feels unworthy of Melora, though
I imagine he will regain her good graces.  I have no such conscience.
 I need no one's forgiveness for my own actions beyond myself.  I
don't know who has it easier.  We are agreed on one thing.  For
atonement, we must end the practice of embedding nexus into the
unwilling.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Atonement must wait, however.  Using a
large amount of balanced energy allowed Kith to balance thea tiny
nexus in a child.  Scaling this up to a regular nexus also works,
though it requires considerably more energy.  We need a dozen or so
geomancers storing the energies of a balanced nexus as it produces it
over several weeks.  Ed, and the Order of the Common Shield
volunteered to provide protection.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Many geomancers also joined our cause,
including the Empire's most wanted, Rory Beardthicket.  He approached
me one afternoon.  He is very devout to his god, even after the
atrocities he committed, but his god supports our efforts.  I doubt
he sees it this way, but this is a chance for atonement.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Speaking of gods...  Biger was working
on gathering some of them to work on restoring Therdun's sanity.  I
didn't follow that too closely, but Pelor did.  Ehlonna contacted me
to extend an invitation to be put on trial by Pelor and the other
gods for our actions.  I'm curious to hear what they have to say,
though I don't honor them, their options, nor am I likely to
willingly accept any punishment from them for my sins.  My colleagues
were also called.  It should be an interesting time, so I have to
admit that I'm curious about what will happen.  
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I can no longer claim innocence, but my
sins are my own to atone.</p>
