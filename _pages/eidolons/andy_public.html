<p>My name is Simone Hadarai and I have a serious case of wander-lust. Everything my parents repressed seems to have come out in me. You see, my father is an Eladrin from the then up-and-coming city of Ashbury. My mother is an Elf from the proud T'Sen tribe. They met when her people were visiting the Nexus in Ashbury. And, well, to make a long story short, I wasn't even born yet, but I became an issue. My father didn't want to give up his work, but my mother couldn't stand the complex machinery, the noise, and the lack of sun. I'm also guessing that they were sick of dealing with their respective families' scorn. But anyways, they ended up choosing the option that left them equally unhappy: they joined with the Martial Ideologues.</p> <p>Of course, they didn't tell me any of this. They never spoke of their past, or their families. I had to seek out my family to get the real story.</p> <p>Growing up, I was always something of an oddity. I could count on a single hand the number of Fey I met. I stood out, especially with my flaming red hair, but I loved the attention. A few of the other children from the outlands didn't fare as well, but I was cute, personable, and made fast friends with just about anyone. I grew up helping my father with his research, and my mother with her deliveries. While both held a certain draw, I still felt like something was missing. I wandered the city on my own, following if someone, or something, caught my eye. Got myself into a little trouble every now and then, but nothing I couldn't work my way out of.</p> <p>I was just starting to question where my life would lead when fate intervened. I made a delivery to one of the guards at the Nexus. Now, I didn't know what a Nexus was, other than it was dangerous and everyone ought to stay away. That's why they kept it guarded at all times. Just getting near the Nexus was enough for me; I knew that this was what had been missing. I didn't know what it was, just that I had to find out.</p> <p>Late at night, I snuck out, and found my way back. I tried to sweet talk the guard, while trying to work the lock on the door behind my back. I managed to pick the lock, and even cracked the door, but that's as close as I got. He wised up, grabbed me and hauled me off. I managed to break free, but I had to get out of the city. He gave chase, but fortunately, a quake occurred just as he caught up to me, and he ended up bound in his own shackles instead of binding me!</p> <p>I made it out of the city, and I was in for a shock. Outside of the city is big. I wandered around for a few days and nearly starved. Luckily I stumbled across a tribe, or more accurately, they stumbled across me. Even more lucky is that I had an aunt and a few cousins about my age in the tribe.</p> <p>It was here that my education started anew. I learned about my mother, and her family's scorn. I learned how to hunt, and joined the hunting parties as often as I could. Aunt Thia taught me a lot about life as a Mystic Nomad.</p> <p>Soon after, I experienced my first Nexus. Wow. This is what I'd been missing. The feeling in the air outside the Ideologue lands was less stifling, but this was a rush of fresh air during a thunderstorm. I couldn't understand how my parents, or anyone else, could have given this up&mdash;but maybe it explains why they were so miserable.</p> <p>After that, things started to change. I left more at east with the world and with myself. I also became much more in tune with the Flow. I started perceive the history and motivations of people around me. I have since learned to hone this skill to allow me to evaluate the results of my actions before I make them. This is a vital skill to have when trying to negotiate very foreign environments and has helped me avoid trouble more times than I can count.</p> <p>I met a lot of new and very different people, and while I didn't look quite so different in comparison, I sure acted it. Both different from them, and different from how I had been. Life in the tribe was very different than life in the city. I had confidence and freedom, and a lot to learn.</p> <p>This is the part of the story where it sounds like I'm settling in for a nice future. I had a wonderful aunt (even if she couldn't stand my mother or her choices), good friends and a boyfriend. Then the tribe arrived at the Technomage city of Anaya deep in the northern Forest. I had seen a few gadgets that my father had held onto (and hidden from my mother), but nothing prepared me for this. Soon after we were allowed entry, I was gone. This place was huge, and full of wonders. It seems like a daze now, but I must have spent months exploring the city. Having a Nexus right there didn't hurt either.</p> <p>I talked to a lot of people and soon landed a job waiting tables. I talked to everyone about everything, but especially to the engineers. I had to know how the city worked! I don't know how long I did this. Sometimes it feels like it was years, other times it feels like it was days. I know I dated a few engineers, but I couldn't even tell you their names now.</p> <p>Eventually I learned that my grandparents lived in this city, so I had to go see them. Unlike my aunt, they weren't happy to see me. They had disowned their son, and blamed me for his defection. My grandfather would stop by and see me at work from time to time. We just had to keep it a secret from my grandmother. Turns out they are researching the prophesy about an upcoming cataclysm. They feel like the Ideologues will be the cause, and can't forgive my father for joining them.</p> <p>I don't know much about the prophesy, or the upcoming cataclysm. I just know that everyone thinks it will be someone else's fault. I have to agree with the Nomads on this one. What will be, will be. And besides, I'm only one person; I don't see how I could help.</p> <p>Like I said before, I'm not sure how long I was in Anaya, or how many tunnels I crawled through, or how may bits and pieces I added to my collection, but it wasn't long before another tribe was visiting the Nexus, and I was off again.</p> <p>While traveling with this new tribe, I decided to go exploring on my own. I was a respectable hunter, so I wasn't too worried. I came across my first (and hopefully last) goblin tribe. They exuded misery from every smelly pore. I needed to get away, but they didn't want to let that happen. I'm still not sure how I escaped, just that it was all instinct. I somehow knew what to say, when to run, and where to hide and I ran with it.</p> <p>I've been traveling the world ever since. I haven't gone back home. I've thought about it, but I'm not sure if I'd be welcomed or jailed. I usually travel with a tribe, or stay in a technomagical city, though I do strike out on my own for a week or two every now and again. I've met many interesting people and seen many interesting places, but I know there's still a huge world out there to explore, and explore it I shall.</p>      </div>
