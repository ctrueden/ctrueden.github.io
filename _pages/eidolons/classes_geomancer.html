        <h3>Geomancer</h3> <p>Practitioners of <a href="/eidolons/setting/geomancy">geomancy</a> manipulate the course of events within the recent past. They are able to alter reality to match the end results of a possible action, without having actually taken that action. The less probable the event, the more difficult it is to manifest its results.<strong><br /> </strong></p> <p>Mechanically, geomancers receive a mixture of spells, mystic magic, and spell-like abilities according to their chosen bloodline (as Pathfinder sorcerer).</p> <p><strong>Paths:&nbsp;</strong>Geomancy effects are divided into&nbsp;three categories, more commonly referred to as paths by their practitioners:</p> <ul>     <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Path of Fate</span> is the power to remake history according to the Geomancer's design.&nbsp; Much like the Flow, he can, with few limitations, undo the consequences of others' actions within a limited time frame.&nbsp; These powers universally have a Quake component.</li>     <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Path of Purity</span> is the power to change the flows of energy that wind their way through the world and its denizens.&nbsp; These powers allow&nbsp;Geomancers to channel positive energy from the land to restore the health of themselves and others, cure ailments, and infuse power into objects, creating temporary and permanent magical items.&nbsp; These powers always have a Ley Line or Nexus component.</li>     <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Path of Prophecy</span> is the power to see and affect the future.&nbsp; These powers allow the Geomancer to see what can be, and some believe that through interpretation of Prophecy one can change the outcome.&nbsp; While some Prophecy powers have a smaller scope and predict the immediate future with great clarity, most Prophecy powers require significant time, energy, and interpretation to understand and make use of.&nbsp; These more arduous powers of Prophecy require a Nexus component.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Component Types:&nbsp;</strong> All Geomancy powers require one of three components. Additional components may in some cases make the effect easier.&nbsp;</p> <ul>     <li><strong>Quake:</strong>&nbsp; Powers requiring a Quake component will cause a localized Event that will be felt by all present.&nbsp; These powers cannot be used within the Empire at all.</li>     <li><strong>Ley Line:</strong>&nbsp; Powers requiring a Ley Line component can only be used when the character is within 30' of a Ley Line that has not been depleted.</li>     <li><strong>Nexus:</strong>&nbsp; Powers requiring a Nexus component can only be performed when immersed within a Nexus.&nbsp; Most powers of Prophecy, and some of the more difficult powers of Purity fall into this category.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Power Levels:</strong> Geomancy powers fall into distinct categories, with associated titles for those Geomancers who attain them: &nbsp;<strong>Apprentice</strong>, <strong>Adept</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Master</strong>, and <strong>Luminary</strong>.</p> <p>In the world, there are sources of power that are commonly used by all people outside of the Empire to refresh their lives.&nbsp; For Geomancers, these power sources are even more important, as they can draw directly upon the <strong>Essence</strong> of these places in order to power their more potent magic.&nbsp; Essence drawn fully replenishes each day.</p> <p><strong>Ley Lines</strong> tend to be categorized into weak, medium and strong lines.&nbsp; Weak Ley Lines tend to be found in desolate areas, such as the deep Wastes, and often have between 10 and 30 Essence.&nbsp; They tend to be easy to find, due to the lines of cactuses that flourish along them.&nbsp; Medium-strength Ley Lines tend to be found in the grasslands.&nbsp; They are also more common in such areas, and tend to store between 30 and 100 Essence, with most having around 50.&nbsp; Strong Ley Lines tend to be found only within forested areas.&nbsp; Such Ley Lines are very rare elsewhere, and generally have between 100 and 250 Essence, with most leaning more on the side of 200-250.</p> <p><strong>Nexuses</strong> are found all over the world, but are more commonplace in more heavily wooded areas or other places of significant verdant growth, such as the Jungle.&nbsp; No nexus has been found that has less than 50 Essence, and even in grassland areas, few have less than 200.&nbsp; In wooded areas, they tend to have 500 or more, and there are rumors of larger Nexuses in the Jungle that are theorized to have as much as 1,000 or more.</p> <p><strong>The Empire:&nbsp;</strong>It is also important to note that it is commonly believed that Geomancy becomes much more difficult within the Empire.&nbsp; Quake effects are from all accounts entirely impossible, and Ley Line effects tend to have unexpected side effects.&nbsp; Nexus effects have never been attempted within the Empire, as all of their Nexuses are carefully guarded and locked away.</p> <p><strong>The Withering:&nbsp;</strong>Also important is how Geomancy works on the Withered.&nbsp; It doesn't.&nbsp; Geomancy simply does not affect them at all.&nbsp; Positive energy channeled into them does not disperse them, negative energy does not heal them.&nbsp; Quake effects do not change them.&nbsp; In short, melee weapons such as axes and hammers are the best way to deal with this kind of menace.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span

</table> <p>*SLA = spell-like ability—choose one of the bloodline spell-like abilities with a spell level up to the maximum listed. This ability can be used at-will, with a vitality cost equal to the normal vitality cost for that spell&nbsp;(e.g., for sor/wiz spells: 1st=1, 2nd=5, 3rd=9, 4th=13, 5th=17, 6th=21).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Geomancers have the following class features:</p> <p><strong>Weapon and Armor proficiency:</strong> Geomancers are proficient in simple weapons and no armor.&nbsp; Geomancers do not suffer from arcane spell failure, as their magic comes from the ambient magic of the land.&nbsp; Instead, they are restricted in types of armor they can wear as per the Druid class.&nbsp; Any augmentation that would permit a Druid to wear other types of armor will apply to a Geomancer as well.</p> <p><strong>Spells:</strong>&nbsp; Similar to warlock invocations, geomancers learn a small number of spells over the course of their advancement. Geomancers may choose their spells from any spell list&nbsp;(including the <a href="/eidolons/magic/geomancer-spells">geomancer spell list</a>), so long as the spell in question fits into one of the categories of magic covered above. Please provide a list of any spells chosen for the GMs to approve; we welcome and encourage explanations of why you feel each spell is appropriate.</p> <p>The maximum spell level for a newly chosen spell is given in the table above. At 6th, 11th, and 16th level, the Geomancer re-evaluates the spell level maximum for spells he may choose from.</p> <p>When casting a spell, the geomancer must pay the same amount of vitality as would normally be required with the spell's associated class. For example, if a geomancer takes a 2nd level bard spell as an Adept, he must pay 4vp each time he casts it. For custom geomancer spells&nbsp;(i.e., spells on the geomancer spell list), he must pay 2vp for Apprentice, 6vp for Adept, 12vp for Master, and 20vp for Luminary level spells.</p><p>A geomancer's caster level is half his class level, rounded up (e.g., a 17th level geomancer has a caster level of 9).</p> <p><strong>Improvisation</strong>:&nbsp; Geomancers have an incredible ability to affect the world around them.&nbsp; This ability requires significant strain on the part of the Geomancer, as he literally compels a small quake to alter his current circumstances in his favor.&nbsp; Using this ability is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.</p> <p>Much of this ability is represented using the <a href="/mystic">Mystic System</a>.&nbsp; A Geomancer begins play with one point in the following Spheres:</p> <ul>     <li>For<strong> Purification: </strong>Healing, Transmutation, Pyrotechnics</li>     <li>For<strong> Prophecy: </strong>Divination, Illusion, Mind Control</li>     <li>For <strong>Fate:</strong><strong> </strong>Enhancement, Creation, Displacement, Kinetics</li><li>For <strong>Corruption:</strong> Destruction, Transmutation, Pyrotechnics</li><li>For <strong>Balance:</strong> Healing, Destruction, Pyrotechnics</li> </ul><p>The geomancer may never have more than one of Purification, Corruption or Balance.</p> <p>These sphere levels will go up one per level to a maximum of 5 at 5th level. The Path Focus feature can raise these spheres higher; however, it should be noted that to perform an effect higher than 5, you must be within 30' of a ley line, and to perform an effect higher than 10, you must be at a Nexus. Effects of level 6 or higher (i.e., those requiring a Ley Line or Nexus) also cost a number of Essence equal to the sphere level of the effect used. In addition, any such effect regardless of level costs one point of Vitality per sphere level used in the effect.</p> <p>The most important factor when attempting to Improvise is the amount of time that the Geomancer can affect.&nbsp; An Apprentice Geomancer has the ability to use Improvisation only upon effects that occured within the last round. At higher levels, the Geomancer may affect more distant times, causing effects to be undone farther back, seeing things farther into the future, or giving himself or his allies a greater ability to affect what is happening. At 6th level, the Geomancer can affect events up to one minute away. At 11th level, the Geomancer can affect events up to one hour away, and at 16th level, the Geomancer can affect events up to one day away.</p> <p>Affecting events becomes more difficult the more time has passed, the farther ahead the Geomancer wishes to predict, or the longer he wishes to try to sway fate.&nbsp; Anything more than an hour distant will cause an intense quake that can be felt many miles away.</p> <p>In addition to all of these abilities, the following are also possible using Improvisation:</p> <ul>     <li><strong>Create</strong> a nonmagical item temporarily.&nbsp; The item must be no larger than a small creature, and will remain for at least as long as the Geomancer has strength of Improvisation (1 round, 1 minute, 1 hour, or 1 day).&nbsp; After that it is likely to be reabsorbed by the next quake.&nbsp; The character must make any applicable Craft check to understand the item well enough to call it into being, but this power is otherwise largely unrestricted.&nbsp; No item of higher value than ten gold.</li>     <li><strong>Transform </strong>an item. A Geomancer can 'swap out' a piece of equipment for another of roughly equal value.&nbsp; This does not include magical items until the Geomancer is of Master level or higher.</li>     <li><strong>Relocate</strong>.&nbsp; A Geomancer can re-choose a single movement taken by a creature so that they are up to that creature's base movement away from where they are currently.&nbsp; This power cannot give the creature movement modes it does not have (it cannot be 30' up if it cannot fly or jump that high, it cannot be across a chasm it cannot jump across, etc.)</li>     <li><strong>Other Stuff</strong>.&nbsp; Many things cannot be covered even by the rules as listed, so if there is something else in particular you would like your Geomancer to be able to do, we are willing to discuss it.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Revitalize:</strong> Like clerics and paladins, geomancers have the ability to transfer vitality from themselves to a willing subject. They can choose any amount of vitality to transfer, and can sense how many points of vitality the target is missing upon initially touching the subject. Note that those who specialize in the Purity Path (see below)&nbsp;gain additional powers with their Revitalize ability.</p> <p><strong>Bloodline:&nbsp;</strong>Like sorcerers, geomancers receive the benefits of a bloodline. However, the levels at which geomancers receive the bloodline benefits are different from sorcerers—see the table above for details. Also, instead of bonus spells, the geomancer receives each bonus spell listed as a spell-like ability usable at will for a vitality cost. (The only exception is planar travel spells such as <em>plane shift</em> and <em>gate</em>—these spells are not allowed; if you choose a bloodline that would gain one of these spells as a spell-like ability, choose something else appropriate instead, subject to our approval.)</p> <p><strong>Path Focus</strong>: Geomancers tend to focus on one of the three paths of Geomancy.&nbsp; Many focus on one to the exclusion of the others, but some choose to have a broader repertoire.</p> <p>At 5th level, and every three levels thereafter (8th, 11th, etc.) the character chooses a Path Focus.&nbsp; This signifies the Geomancer's dedication to unlocking the secrets of one of the three paths of mastery, and conveys certain benefits.&nbsp; A character will gain different special abilities that significantly augment the chosen path.&nbsp; Powers must be taken in order.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Prophecy Path Abilities</strong></p> <p>Divination Focus</p> <ul>     <li>The character continues to gain sphere levels in Divination, Illusion and Mind Control, up to a maximum of 10.&nbsp; Note that any effect of more than level 5 requires a Ley Line and costs Essence equal to the level of the effect in addition to the vitality cost.</li>     <li>In addition to the normal effects of a divination, the character always receives a brief image of what he has foreseen.</li> </ul> <p>Divination Mastery</p> <ul>     <li>The character continues to gain sphere levels in Divination, Illusion and Mind Control, up to a maximum of 15.&nbsp; Note that any effect of more than level 10 requires a Nexus and costs Essence equal to the level of the effect in addition to the vitality cost.</li>     <li>The character may predict the outcome of an action taken, and by doing so change his mind about whether he attempts it.&nbsp; In effect, the character can take back a single action taken during the round, causing him to revert to whatever state he was in before he did it, with none of the effects of that action having occured.&nbsp; Use of this power is very draining, and the Geomancer is reduced to one point of Vitality and is Fatigued.&nbsp; If the character is already Fatigued, they become Exhausted.&nbsp; If the character is already Exhausted, they fall unconscious until they are forced awake or they are fully rested.&nbsp; The Geomancer must in any case have at least 20 Vitality to activate this ability.</li> </ul> <p>Oracle</p> <ul>     <li>The character continues to gain sphere levels in Divination, Illusion and Mind Control, up to a maximum of 20.</li>     <li>The character benefits from <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/foresight">Foresight</a>.&nbsp; This power is always active.&nbsp; Additionally, the character may select up to one ally per point of Intelligence bonus that he may also affect with this power.&nbsp; It is still incumbent on the Oracle to notify affected allies of imminent danger.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Fate Path Abilities</strong></p> <p>Fate Focus</p> <ul>     <li>The character continues to gain sphere levels in Enhancement, Creation, Displacement and Kinetics, up to a maximum of 10.&nbsp; Note that any effect of more than level 5 requires a Ley Line and costs Essence equal to the level of the effect in addition to the vitality cost.</li>     <li>The character may grant an ally within 30' a +4 luck bonus to an attack roll or saving throw after the roll has been made but before success has been determined.

This can be an attack roll, a saving throw, or a skill check occurring over the course of a single round, such as tumbling or feinting.
