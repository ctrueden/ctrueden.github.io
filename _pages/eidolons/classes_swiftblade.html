        <p>The swiftblade class listed here has been adapted from the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/prc/20070327">online D&amp;D&nbsp;article</a>.</p>
<p>While sorcerers and wizards consider <i>haste</i> one of many spells in their repertoire, swiftblades covet <i>haste</i> above all others. As a swiftblade, your arcane-assisted speed combined with melee skill can turn your first strike into a deadly assault. Swiftblades discover unconventional ways to utilize the <i>haste</i> spell, permanently augmenting their speed and fusing complimentary spell effects into each casting. In a very real sense, swiftblades bond to their chosen spell until the two become immutable.</p>
<h4>Becoming a Swiftblade</h4>
<p>Bards, sorcerers, and wizards are the three most obvious candidates for swiftblades. Bards can easily fulfill the martial weapon proficiency requirement, but sorcerers and wizards do not share their expertise. Elf candidates are naturally proficient with racial martial weapons and human candidates can take Martial Weapon Proficiency with their extra feat to avoid losing a level of spellcasting. A sorcerer or wizard might otherwise multiclass into a warrior class for one level.</p>
<p>Besides their spellcasting ability score, Dexterity is the second most important attribute for swiftblades. It allows them to avoid blows and potentially strike first in combat. Strength and Constitution are also important to swiftblades, who are largely melee characters. Not having the resilience of pure warriors, Tumble is an ideal skill choice for swiftblades to avoid attacks of opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Entry Requirements</b></p>
<p><b>Base Attack Bonus: </b>+3.<br />
<b>Skills: </b>Concentration 6 ranks, Spellcraft 6 ranks.<br />
<b>Spellcasting: </b>Ability to cast <i><i>haste</i></i>.<br />
<b>Feats: </b>Dodge, Mobility.<br />
<b>Weapon Proficiency: </b>Must be proficient with at least one martial weapon.<br />
<b>Special: </b>Must have spent the entire previous level attempting to be hasted at all times. Reasonable breaks to regain lost vitality and rest are acceptable, as long as haste is recast as soon as possible afterwards.</p>

<h4>Class Features</h4>
<p>As they advance in level, swiftblades gain heightened speed and unparalleled understanding of the <i>haste</i> spell.</p>
<p><b>Spring Attack:</b> Beginning at 1st level, you gain Spring Attack as a bonus feat. If you already have Spring Attack, choose a different feat for which you do meet the prerequisites.</p>
<p><b>Swift Surge (Su):</b> Your body is augmented with the residual energy of previous <i>haste</i> castings. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. At 7th level, these bonuses increase to +2. At 4th level, you gain a +10 foot enhancement bonus to all of your modes of movement and deal an extra 1d6 points of damage during any round in which you move at least 10 feet. At 10th level, this bonus increases to +20 feet and an extra 2d6 points of damage during any round in which you move at least 20 feet. These bonuses stack with the bonuses gained from the <i>haste</i> spell and skirmish ability.</p>
<p><b>Blurred Alacrity (Su):</b> At 2nd level, your understanding of the <i>haste</i> spell makes you difficult to target with melee and ranged attacks. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i> spell that you cast yourself, you gain concealment (5% miss chance). This miss chance increases by +5% at 3rd, 4th, and 5th level. The effect of this ability does not stack with <i>blur, displacement</i>, or similar spell effects.</p>
<p><b>Sudden Casting (Su):</b> At 3rd level, you learn how to seamlessly cast the <i>haste</i> spell. You can cast <i>haste</i> as a swift action once per round, as if augmented by the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, but without using up higher-level spell slots.</p>
<p><b>Arcane Reflexes (Su):</b> At 4th level, you infuse the energy of previous <i>haste</i> castings into your natural reaction time. You receive a +2 enhancement bonus to initiative rolls. At 9th level this bonus increases to +4.</p>
<p><b>Evasive Celerity (Su):</b> At 5th level, your knowledge of the <i>haste</i> spell makes you difficult to target with spells. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i> spell that you cast yourself, individually targeted spells have a 5% chance of failing against you. This spell failure chance increases by +5% at 6th, 7th, and 8th level. The effect of this ability does not stack with <i>blink </i>or similar spell effects.</p>
<p><b>Tenacious Haste (Su):</b> At 6th level, you learn how to intuitively absorb the <i>haste</i> spell into your body. If a <i>haste</i> spell that you cast on yourself is successfully dispelled, it is instead suppressed for one round. The suppressed round counts against the spell's normal duration.</p>
<p><b>Bounding Assault:</b> At 7th level, you gain Bounding Assault (see page 75 of <i>Player's Handbook II</i>) as a bonus feat. You need not have the prerequisites normally required for Bounding Assault to gain this feat. If you already have Bounding Assault, choose a different feat for which you do meet the prerequisites.</p>
<p><b>Diligent Rapidity (Su):</b> At 8th level, you automatically overcome magic and mundane obstacles with the <i>haste</i> spell. While under the effect of a <i>haste</i> spell that you cast yourself, you can move and attack normally, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, as the <a href="/eidolons/magic/freedom-of-movement"><i>freedom of movement</i></a> spell. As an additional effect, you can also move across the surface of placid or flowing water, but not whitewater rapids or stormy water, by making two move actions in a round. You immediately sink any time you make a single move action in a round or come to a complete stop while traversing water.</p>
<p><b>Innervated Speed (Su):</b> At 10th level, your mastery of the <i>haste</i> spell can bring the world around you to a standstill. Once per day, at the cost of 20 vitality, you can take one extra standard action during your turn.</p>      </div>
