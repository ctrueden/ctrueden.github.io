        <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">Legend  speaks of a time in the earliest dawn of the world, before the rise  of the humanoid peoples. According to these tales, conflict and warfare  were concepts unfamiliar to the primordial beings that walked the planes.  As the story goes, forces of good and evil were also absent, though  with the coming of mankind, such a void could not remain. As the first  act of benevolence and cooperation took place, so too was born the first  act of malevolence and agression. With contact came conflict, and soon  the forces of this conflict grew beyond the actions of mortals which  perpetuated them; they became beings unto themselves.</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">These  new beings sought to grind the peoples of the world, as well the living  spirit of the world itself, to an ashen waste, soaked in blood and misery.  It was said that the old spirits of creation; those who built the order  of the universe, and those who broke the unused back to its component  chaos; took up the cause of protecting the fledgling races of man. Together,  they fought back these beings of hate, cruelty, and opressive darkness.  When at last they had freed the world from their enemies' advance, it  is said they left a legacy to the races of man, that they might hold  them in stewardship, protecting their world. These were known as the  twin fists of creation.</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">The  Way of the Heaven Fist was the way of order and binding, the way of  knowing structure and purpose, as well as preserving equilibrium, and  dicipline. The way of the Heaven fist is to be aware of the many threads  and bonds that make up both one's self, and one's opponent. To strike  with clarity of purpose at the weakest point of one's enemy is the Heaven  Fist's strength. The virtues it espouses are temperance, patience, and  grace. Its techniques often manifest affinity with light and cold. The  primary weakness of the Heaven fist is a perceived emotional detachment  that comes from an emphasis on objective dicipline.</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2">The  Way of the Hell Fist was the way of punishment and freedom, the way  of calling upon the most furious of personal strengths in order to overcome  a dire need. Driven both by fury at ones own opression, and a burning  need to see the cruel brought low, The Hell fist drives one past the  limitations of their mortal flesh, that they might aid the weak and  bear the burden of destroying an otherwise superior foe.To call upon  the true reserves of strength needed by this art, one must incite powerful  and passionate feelings. As such, a student of the way can find its  use as emotionally draining as it is physically so. Many of its techniques  relate to fire, as well as seemingly inhuman applications of direct  power.The virtues of the Hell fist are Valor, Compassion, and Fortitude.  The weakness of the Hell fist lies in the unpredictable nature of the  passion it inspires and requires.</font></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><strong>Maneuvers<br /> </strong></u></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Heaven Fist:</b></font></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1st: </b> Moment of perfect mind (pg.64) Sapphire Nightmare blade (pg. 65) Counter  Charge (pg. 71) Mighty Throw (pg. 73) Clinging shadow strike (pg. 76)  Shadow blade technique (pg.78)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2nd:</b>  Action before thought (pg 62) Emerald razor (pg. 63) Cloak of Deception  (pg.76) Shadow jaunt (pg. 79)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3rd:</b>  Insightful Strike (pg 63-64) Mind over body (pg. 64) Devastating Throw  (pg. 71-72) Feigned opening (pg. 72) Shadow Garrote (pg. 78) Strength  Draining strike (pg.80)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>4th:</b>  Mind Strike (pg. 64) Ruby Nigthmare Blade (pg. 65) Comet Throw (pg.  71) Strike of the Broken Shield (pg. 74-75) Hand of Death (pg. 77-78)  Obscuring Shadow Veil (pg. 78)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5th: </b> Bounding assault (pg. 62) Disrupting Blow (pg. 63) Rapid counter (pg.  65) Mirrored Pursuit (pg. 73) Soaring Throw (pg. 73-74) Bloodletting  strike (pg. 75-76) Shadow Stride (pg.80)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6th:</b>  Insightful Strike, Greater (pg. 64) Moment of Alacrity (pg. 64) Ballista  Throw (pg. 70) Scorpion Parry (pg. 73) Ghost Blade (pg. 73)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">Hell Fist</font>:<br /> </strong></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1st:</b>  Burning Blade (pg.52) Wind Stride (pg. 56) Crusader's Strike (pg. 58)  Vanguard Strike (pg. 62) Charging Minotaur (pg 81-82) Stone Bones (pg.  82)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2nd:</b>  Burning Brand (pg 52) Fire Riposte (Pg. 53) Flashing Sun (pg. 54) Hatchlings  Flame (pg. 54) Foehammer (Pg. 59) Shield Block (pg. 60) Mountain Hammer  (pg. 84) Stone Vise (pg. 85)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3rd:</b>  Death Mark (pg. 52) Fan the flames (pg. 53) Zephyr Dance (pg. 57) Defensive  Rebuke (pg. 58) Revitalizing Strike (pg. 60) Bonecrusher (pg. 81) Stone  Dragon's Fury (pg. 85)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>4th:</b>&nbsp;  Firesnake (pg 53) Searing Blade (pg. 56) Divine Surge (pg. 58) Entangling  Blade (pg. 58-59) Bonesplitting strike (pg. 81) Boulder Roll (pg. 81)  Overwhelming Mountain Strike (pg. 84)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5th:</b>  Dragon's Flame (pg. 53) Leaping Flame (pg.55) Lingering Inferno (pg.  55) Daunting Strike (pg. 58) Radiant Charge (pg. 60) Doom Charge (pg.  58) Dazing strike (pg. 67) Elder Mountain Hammer (pg.82-83) Mountain  Avalanche (Pg. 84) </font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6th:</b>  Desert Tempest (pg. 52) Ring of Fire (pg. 55) Rallying Strike (pg. 60)  Crushing Vise (pg. 82) Iron Bones (pg. 83) Irresistable Mountain Strike  (pg. 83)</font>&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><u><strong>Stances<br /> </strong></u></p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Heaven Fist:</b></font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1st:</b>  Stance of Clarity (pg.66) Step of the wind (pg.74) Child of Shadow (pg.  76) Island of blades (pg. 78)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3rd:</b>  Pearl of Black Doubt (pg. 64-65) Giant Killing Style (pg. 72-73) Assassin's  stance (pg.75) Dance of the spider (pg. 76) Leaping Dragon Stance (pg.  88)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5th:</b>  Hearing the air (pg. 63) Shifting defense (pg. 73) Step of the dancing  Moth (pg. 80)</font>&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Hell Fist:</b></font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1st:</b>  Flames Blessing (pg. 53) Iron guard's Glare (pg. 59) Martial Spirit  (pg. 60) Stonefoot Stance (pg. 85)</font>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3rd:</b>  Holocaust Cloak (pg. 54) Thicket of Blades (pg. 61) Crushing Weight  of the Mountain (pg.82) Roots of the Mountain (pg. 84)</font></p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5th:</b>  Giant's stance (pg. 83)</font></p>      </div>
