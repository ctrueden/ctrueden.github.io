        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">m</span><strong>artial ideologues</strong> are an imperial society, passionate and uncompromising. Their gods, Moradin and Bahamut, have issued a divine edict that use of the <a href="/eidolons/setting/nexuses">nexuses</a> (including to refresh) is anathema. Hence, the ideologues seek to stop everyone from doing so. Being an honorable culture, they always negotiate before battle, to give the opposition every opportunity to surrender without bloodshed. Joining the empire of the ideologues has an obvious, positive consequence: citizens of the empire do not wither. There is also an absence of <a href="/eidolons/setting/flow">flow</a> within its boundaries. When the ideologues capture a nexus, they always sequester it&mdash;the leadership believes that if a nexus is tapped within their borders, it could endanger their benefits. Consequently, elite warriors called Norns are assigned to guard the nexuses, and the clerics ward protections around them.</p> <ul>     <li>Common races: deva, dragonborn, dwarf</li>     <li>Alignment: generally lawful, often good</li>     <li>Classes: champion, cleric, crusader, fighter, swashbuckler, warblade</li> </ul> <p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/prophets">prophets</a>: Some of the ideologues agree with the prophets that a cataclysm is coming, but they argue that the solution is to stop tapping the nexuses. The ideologues have been hesitant to take any aggressive action against the cities of the prophets, since they don't understand their defensive capabilities.</p> <p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/nomads">nomads</a>: Since the nomads have no lands of their own, the ideologues do not seek to conquer them. They do try to evangelize, but many feel it is futile, since the nomad philosophy is so opposed to their own.</p>      </div>
