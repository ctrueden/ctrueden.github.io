        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">m</span><strong>ystic nomads</strong> are a subtle, nuanced people, often cryptic but wise. Tribal hunter/gatherers, they revere the flow, and the elemental chaos. They believe in enlightenment through introspection, community and unity with nature rather than property. They are nomadic, not technological, and strongly believe the nexuses should be free to all, and never exclusively dominated. Unfortunately, the nexuses available to them have been continually reduced as the other cultures have spread their influence and built cities. Though the nomads feel tremendously threatened, most among them are fatalistic, believing that &quot;que sera sera.&quot; Still, some among them have chosen to fight back, to protect themselves as well as the remaining free lands, despite disapproval from their elders.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Common races: elf, halfling, other natural fey</li>
    <li>Alignment: generally chaotic, usually neutral</li>
    <li>Classes: druid, geomancer, monk, ranger, rogue, swordsage</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/prophets">prophets</a>: The nomads fear that their fey brethren have forgotten their roots in their quest for knowledge. They have heard the prophecy of the cataclysm, but do not believe in fighting against it&mdash;if it is coming, then it is coming, and there is nothing that can be done. The nomads do appreciate being allowed to refresh at the technocities' nexuses, but some among them harbor resentment that the prophets have walled the nexuses off.</p>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/empire">Empire</a>: The nomads avoid ideologue lands, believing them to be deficient due to their lack of flow. Some younger nomads feel intense hatred toward the ideologues for defying their most sacred belief (that use of the nexuses should never be denied to anyone). However, the nomads lack sufficient numbers to pose a significant threat to the ideologues' military progress into tribal lands.</p>      </div>
