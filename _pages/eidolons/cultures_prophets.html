        <p>The <strong>technomagical prophets</strong> are an inquisitive, practical people, blunt but open-minded. Trying to understand the world, they are the most technologically and magically advanced. The prophets have evidence that a cataclysm is coming, but have been unable to convince the other cultures to take action, so they have taken it upon themselves to save the world. Their mechanism for generating prophecy requires a large quantity of spiritual energy, so they have heavily tapped their nexuses. Though not imperialistic, they do pursue major nexuses (the more intersecting lines the better), building technomagical cities around them, connected by teleportation portals. As such, their influence is thinly spread across the world.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Common races: eladrin, genasi, gnome, warforged</li>
    <li>Alignment: generally neutral</li>
    <li>Classes: fighter&nbsp;(warforged), geomancer, runemage</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/nomads">nomads</a>: The prophets, being fey, were once very close to their nomad brethren, but recently they have drifted apart due to philosophical differences. However, in respect for their shared history, the prophets allow the nomads free access to the nexuses.</p>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/empire">Empire</a>: The prophets are in engaged in diplomatic talks with the ideologues, but both sides have strong beliefs and have thus far refused to compromise on key issues. Some prophets are intrigued by the benefits offered by Moradin and Bahamut, and have offered to share technological or magical knowledge in exchange for these divine secrets, but the ideologues have refused, stating that their gods' bounty is sacred, not for sale or trade.</p>      </div>
