        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">t</span><strong>ribal hordes</strong> are not a single culture, but rather a heterogeneous group of tribes divided mainly along racial lines, most of which are&nbsp; extremely aggressive and territorial. Most control no more than a handful of nexuses. Some control none, and maintain their numbers through necromancy when their living members fall to the withering.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Common races: giant, goblin, ogre, orc, troll, etc.</li>
    <li>Alignment: generally evil</li>
    <li>Classes: barbarian, necromancer, shaman</li>
</ul>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/prophets">prophets</a>: There are a handful of tribes who have been displaced when the prophets sprouted technological barricades around their nexuses. Such tribes do not possess the tools to retake their stolen homelands, but lie in wait seeking opportunities for ambush. Some of them have even begun inhabiting the defensive structures surrounding the cities&mdash;though largely impenetrable, the tubes and plates comprise complex warrens of useful tunnels and other structures.</p>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/nomads">nomads</a>: Some tribes, particularly the orcs, hate the nomads, attacking them on sight, but others ignore them if they don't cause any trouble. As such, the nomads often pass through tribal lands without bloodshed.</p>
<p>Relationship with the <a href="/eidolons/cultures/empire">Empire</a>: Recently the ideologues have been focusing their war efforts against the hordes, expanding into the tribal lands. As such, nearly all tribes will attack ideologue forces on sight.<strong><br />
