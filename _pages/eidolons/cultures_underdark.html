        <p>Most inhabitants of the surface are unaware that another society flourishes deep beneath the earth, in the Underdark. But the <strong>denizens of the Underdark</strong> know about the surface dwellers, and have been watching them for some time. As the daywalkers live their lives and fight their wars, the rulers of the Underdark factions keep tabs, tracking their movements and taking advantage where possible.</p>
<p>Doing so is necessary, because the Underdark's drow and tiefling denizens are cursed. Like the daywalkers, they must refresh at a nexus to stay alive. But unlike those on the surface, a normal nexus does nothing but inflict pain to them. Instead, the drow and tieflings must taint the ley lines with a dark ritual, inverting the nexus. Those on the surface might call such an inversion &quot;corruption,&quot; but the tieflings have little choice, for they can only successfully refresh from inverted nexuses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once a nexus has been inverted, it slowly destabilizes, eventually collapsing, at which point a new nexus must be found. Thus, expedition parties are sent out throughout the Underdark's dangerous tunnels at their leaders' behest, to locate and secure new nexuses for use by their people. The tieflings and drow are fully aware of how unsustainable this lifestyle is in the long term -- some hold a grudge against the devils who granted power to their ancestors at such a terrible price -- but for the time being there is little choice but to proceed with the expeditions, learn and wait for the moment when things will change for their people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, opposing factions within the Underdark constantly struggle for supremacy, engaging in the utmost treachery to further their individual ends.</p>
