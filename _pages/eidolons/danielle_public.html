<p>Iraja Neviah Beag (ee ruh juh - neh VYE ah - bek)</p> <p>Mystic Nomad</p> <p>600 yrs old</p> <p>Extremely androgynous, fit Halfling; perhaps exuding more female characteristics.&nbsp; Dressed in traveling clothes and leather armor.&nbsp; Black hair cut in a very short and interesting style, that only allows the hair to slightly reveal its waviness.&nbsp; Very large, deep dark grey-green eyes.</p> <p>Nomadic Prophet Gone Astray</p> <p>My name is Iraja Neviah Beag and I was born to Nomads Iliriana Aleta Neviah of the Baenallia Tribe and Rajasi Kritnu Beag of the Gearnon Tribe.&nbsp; They are both strong, curious, and small people.&nbsp; They travel less distance exploring than they used to but they continue to build strong bonds with their kin and kith.&nbsp; They taught me to follow the path to knowledge, stand by what I believe, as well as how to adjust embrace and enhance the flow around us.</p> <p>I myself am a nomadic Geomancer Spellthief.&nbsp; My appearance suggests full maturity of about 30 years.&nbsp; I can tell you that I have been here many more years than that but not near as many as the ancient ones.&nbsp; I grew as a seer and prophet with the Baenallian people.&nbsp; I always had a knack for gaining strength and insight from the ley lines and nexus points.&nbsp; Chazona Aindri Clem is a very ancient seer who was of my people but also travels alone much of the time and has deep connections with many tribes.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to gain her respect and be able to learn from her how to embrace the prophecies and retell them without bias or incorrect interpretation.&nbsp; I studied with her for nearly fifty years.&nbsp; She was am amazing teacher, mentor and will always be a great friend, I hope.&nbsp; She was a great relief and support for me when our brethren broke from us about two hundred years past.&nbsp; I especially did not take my old friend and cousin Sevran Kritnu Baenanís departure very well at first.&nbsp; Chazona helped me to see that the difference in interpretation was not necessarily wrong and that this was truly an example of the prophecies showing themselves through odd paths.</p> <p>Eventually I learned that the earth could not only give me power, but so could other earth dwellers.&nbsp; Some people do not like this flow of power nearly so much.&nbsp; As a prophet I merely told them what the Earth was whispering and they knew I was just a messenger.&nbsp; With the ability to literally take from others one becomes a threat in the wrong circumstances.&nbsp; I have therefore always used my power with respect and good intent, especially with my kin and kith.</p> <p>Not long ago things turned very much for me.&nbsp; I began to experience a most deep feeling of dread and the prophecies started coming to me even more often, in my waking and sleeping hours.&nbsp; There were different though, broken and allusive in meaning.&nbsp; I feel that they are all linked together as some huge story.&nbsp; All that I have gotten from it so far is that the nexuses are at risk, and should not be guarded and controlled as they are. For the first time I am ridden with so much fear that even after great thought I feel that we can no longer stand by, action is finally needed.</p> <p>I was respected by my people and one day it was thought that I would even be a great elder.&nbsp; Since I have started to see these dreadful things no one trusts me.&nbsp; Iliriana and Rajasi seem to have lost respect and pride for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; And my closest friend, Glwys Aiken Jager, has actually turned his back on me.&nbsp; It is almost as if he forgot all the rest of his heritage and the strength of bonds of kith for the belief in inaction.&nbsp; I am now traveling more alone and with more of a purpose than I have ever before in my life. I feel that I need to seek out more answers and that a conference with Chazona once again would be greatly warranted.<br /> &nbsp;</p>      </div>
