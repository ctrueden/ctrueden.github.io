        <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Stories start somewhere, but it&rsquo;s always such a subjective thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">You could argue this one started when dark races made pacts with equally insufficiently illuminated gods, exchanging sustainable ecology for infernal power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It would be <i style="">somewhat</i> more succinct and to the point to say that this story starts 200 years ago, when the Narhari family of Rakshasa decided to attempt to invert nexii on the surface &ndash; by disguising themselves, somewhat ironically, as Devas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The plan was pretty brilliant, actually. Since inversion of a nexus eventually destabilizes and destroys it, and only high priests and royalty are allowed to enter the giant walls they build around nexii to Protect The Empire From The Corrupting Influence Of The Flow, one could slip in and corrupt it without anyone being the wiser, and when it is eventually destroyed &ndash; voila! The ritual worked! We&rsquo;re doing the work of the gods!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The Narhari&nbsp;Rakshasa found a small city-state on the border of Imperial territory by the name of </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">Manavendra</span><span style="">, and - in a covert-ops campaign that made an IRA guerilla assault look like a kid flushing a cherry bomb down the commode - slew the ruling Deva family, and took their place.<a title="" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[1]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> They inverted the Nexus, and have been drinking from it ever since, by pretending to have the entire family perform a nexus-dissolving ritual once a month. As there was technically a kernel of truth to all of this, and that the nexus would eventually be dissolved, this actually worked out relatively well for everyone involved, save the original royal family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">For centuries, they ruled the land with&hellip; Well, less an iron fist and more a fuzzy glove with spikes on the fingers, spikes pointed towards Tribal Horde-owned nexii; After all, they would eventually need to sequester and invert another nexus &ndash; although they passed it off as part of the Holy Bahamut-given Crusade to rid the world of the Flow. Narhari tactics were ruthless, but undeniably effective; Shows of overwhelming force and unrelenting brutality designed to break the morale of their foes. Some in the Empire questioned their methods<a title="" name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[2]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a>, but it was always a little hard to argue with their success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But even that isn&rsquo;t the story we seek to tell right now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A couple of centuries after the Rakshasa took power, they had a son. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Vashir Narhari, as he would be named, would take well to the noble lifestyle. Envision an actual cat placed in a position of nobility, privilege, and power, and as long as one accepts the premise that cats are hedonistic, selfish bastards, one quickly extrapolates what takes place. For 30 years he luxuriated in a cushy, decadent lifestyle<a title="" name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[3]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> worthy at least of the declining days of Rome, </span>punctuated by occasional state functions and combat lessons from a Arrek Vanatix, Master of the quasimystic Heaven and Hell Fist styles of combat.<br />
<br />
For all his other lacking virtues, Vashir was quite talented with a blade, and reasonably devoted to its practice, the rush of battle one more joy to the spoiled princeling. His infernal heritage saw him take quite naturally to the Hell Fist style - to a degree that honestly worried the Master, in much the same way a cross-disciplined explosives expert/occultist might be worried by watching an 8 year old try and succeed in building a satanic IED on his first go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After a time, Vashir even began participating in Narhari military actions. In a number of actions, such as the now infamous Macram&eacute; Incident, he earned quite the reputation for brutality. Martial Empire tournaments -<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Contests of skill and swordplay being naturally the sort of thing that happen with fair regularity in Ideologue lands.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">One day, Vashir was on his way back from one such tournament; He&rsquo;d only taken third, but he was able to rationalize, with some justification, that this was largely because showing off <i style="">everything </i>he could do, according to Master Arrek, was a bad idea.<a title="" name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[4]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> He&rsquo;d taken an ill-advised shortcut back through Prophet territory and was staying in a seaside inn called the Three Palms<a title="" name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[5]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> when he felt it for the first time in his life; the rush-and-gong of a tremor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He returned to find </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 51, 0);">Manavendra </span><span style="">aflame, with fighting in the streets; At first he&rsquo;d just assumed that the local Dwarven Axeball Adamantine Bowl Festival had just gotten out of hand<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"> </span>again, but closer inspection revealed that this was apparently the last phase of a city siege that had been going on for months, despite the fact that he&rsquo;d only actually been gone for a few weeks. In this universe, the Tribal Hordes had not been cowed by the purges, executions, and bloody warfare &ndash; merely enraged. While the disproportionate amount of resources the Hordes spent on a mid-size border city may have been a good thing for the Imperial war effort as a whole, it wasn&rsquo;t a very good thing for the Narhari family.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Upon seeing his beloved fortress-palace &ndash; and thus, his hedonistic paradise - awash in flames, Vashir actually wound up thinking of his family first.<a title="" name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[6]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> Upon seeing the bodies of his mother, father, and older sister in more pieces than strictly healthy for an adult shapeshifter, he spent the next five minutes utterly dumbfounded &ndash; and the next four hours in a state that, it can be said, resembled nothing so much as the unholy offspring of furious abyssal denizen and an industrial wood chipper. Holding nothing back, he personally eviscerated dozens of Hordeites in ways that Technoprophet anatomical science would one day be forced to dismiss as improbable anecdotal evidence; but dozens barely made a dent in the wall. For every ogre introduced in a heartfelt manner to his own intestinal tract, there were ten more just behind him. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Self-preservation kicked in over rage eventually, but while the flames eventually died out of his city, the embers in his soul smoldered on; His wonderful life and his family, taken from him just as much by very upset tribes as by a blip in spacetime, by the flap of a butterfly&rsquo;s wings, the stroke of a cosmic pen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">His old identity cast aside, his only marketable skills found him work as a freelance mercenary, but he resents the dull parts of the work, and he tends to blow so much of his pay on the creature comforts of his former life that he isn&rsquo;t really getting anywhere. Even more than he wants revenge on the hordes, he wants his family back. And even more than that, he wants his lifestyle back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">And after the universe had done him a turn like that, he feels fully justified in doing whatever it takes to get them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A) Shardul Narhari (high-level LE Rakshasa Rogue/Assassin)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Vashir&rsquo;s father was the mastermind behind the operation, a master strategist. Careful, cunning, a knife in the dark and a spin surgeon general in the light &ndash; but willing to do whatever it took to claim a nexus for himself and his family, and avoid shriveling up like a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He was patient enough to make geological erosion seem hasty, willing to delay gratification for greater ends - So much unlike his son. This was understandable; Vashir had never known anything but idyllic paradice that the patriarch had built. He had never known the deprivations of the Underdark, a place so treacherous that even the tigers watched their backs; never known the hardships of a life wherein Advanced Treacherous Bastardry 547 was a survival course. Shardul let it continue, however &ndash; because a small part of Shardul almost didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the innocence &ndash; however twisted and hedonistic - that his son knew, but he eventually came to the conclusion that Vashir had to do <i style="">some</i>thing useful with his life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Enter:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">B) Arrek Vanatix (high-level N Dragonborn Swordsage)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">For hundreds of years, Arrek had seen it as his duty to collect knowledge of the styles of the world; to seek understanding in the wave of every blade. This is not inherently unusual in a swordsage, but he was truly committed to the philosophy &ndash; entirely regardless of whether or not the style was considered &ldquo;pure&rdquo; or &ldquo;dodgy&rdquo; or &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; or &ldquo;liable to suck out your soul through your urethra.&rdquo; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">He saw it as his further duty to train others, to spread his accumulated knowledge to the promising and receptive &ndash; but it was easy to find students for, say, the Heaven Fist; It was much harder to toss a pitch like &ldquo;How would you like to learn how to manipulate abyssal and forbidden forces with which mankind was not meant to consort?&rdquo;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Arrek&rsquo;s search for a useful receptacle for the Hell Fist came by serendipity, when he watched Vashir in a barfight; First of all, he&rsquo;d never previously been able to draw motion parallels between a chair and a katana, but second and more importantly, there was something very <i style="">feline</i> about the way he moved and struck. Vicious. Predatory. In a word, Perfect, at least from the point of view of the Hell Fist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">When he asked permission from Shardul to train the boy, the Narhari patriarch couldn&rsquo;t accept fast enough; the logic being that not only did the family have no private qualms about the infernal nature of the style, but maybe a little training and discipline would make something out of this otherwise useless kitten. And it did, to an extent, though Arrek had never seen anything quite like it. Although Vashir could only be bothered to understand the basic precepts of the philosophy, he had an almost instinctual talent for the actual arts and maneuvers &ndash; which was a juxtaposition of circumstance Arrek felt was vaguely <i style="">wrong.</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Actual respect for non-Rakshasa being something nearly foreign to Vashir, grudging respect was present in spades &ndash; but then, someone who can turn you on your ass in six different ways using only the contents of his breakfast tray deserves at least that much &ndash; and more if he&rsquo;s willing to teach you to do the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">C) Grig Leadpipe (mid-level NE Dwarf Rogue)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Even the Empire has its underbelly, and when Vashir wanted something in which he couldn&rsquo;t publicly indulge, he changed into another guise (Itinerant merchant Nahme For&rsquo;thkomin) and looked up Grig. Grig had connections to unsavory amusements; Vashir had both money and interests in sampling unsavory amusements. This formed the basis of a decade-long and mutually beneficial friendship &ndash; and even going so far as a sort of twisted camaraderie. They shared quite a lot from that point on &ndash; from week-long drug-fueled benders<a title="" name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[7]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> to a good stiff drink to the subsequent barfight. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The value of Grig as a contact has declined somewhat following the destruction of the city, but he&rsquo;s very much like a cockroach &ndash; Short, squat, hardy, and able to cling to the underbelly of anyplace where civilization achieves a certain critical mass. He&rsquo;s probably around somewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">4) Ugar Vol&rsquo;vox (High level CE Fighter/Barbarian)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the things the soldiers of the Manavendra fortress were taught is to think of the Hordes as sub-sentient, bestial, and, as much as the word can apply, inhuman; <a title="" name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8" style=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style=""><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">[8]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></a> to raise in them as few doubts about their missions as possible. The word &ldquo;Civilian&rdquo; might as well have been a style of pasta for all that it applied to the Hordes. They were monsters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, they didn&rsquo;t see themselves that way; nor did Ugar exactly have much appreciation for the Narhari task force that slew <i style="">his</i> kin. Vashir never knew it &ndash; and neither did Agar - but in a way, it was all eye-for-an-eye revenge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In Vashir&rsquo;s happy timeline, he personally slew Ugar in short order during an assault; in the not-so-happy one, Ugar survived, and rallied the hordes around his cause. He actually went and led the armies that burned the city until it was little more than carnage-covered sidewalk grit with bones sticking out of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ugar has become aware that Vashir existed &ndash; through a combination of noble family portraits and the advanced interrogation technique known as grabbing someone by the head, pointing, and going &ldquo;Who is dat?!&rdquo; - but is unsure as to his whereabouts or if he currently lives, just like everyone else who survived the Manavendra Massacre. Certainly if he finds out Vashir is still alive at all, he <i style="">will</i></span> want him dead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5) Bacillus Stonerune (LN Dwarf Aristocrat/Runemage)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Narhari family had few political rivals and challengers. This was not by accident &ndash; but not because their rivals tended to meet <i style="">with </i>accidents. Shardul was not generally in favor of leaving the bodies of public figures around when he stood to gain the most from someone&rsquo;s death; instead, he preferred character assassination, which is a method of espionage at which Rakshasa are substantially gifted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When identity shifts with a flick of your fingers, smear campaigns are a snap, if thought out properly; In addition to manipulating the &lsquo;behavior&rsquo; of your victims, it&rsquo;s easy as anything to conjure witnesses; hells, to create a whole bloody cast for your play &ndash; especially when your entire family can act in concert.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shardul alone assumed six different roles for the smear campaign against Stonerune, who called Narhari&rsquo;s &lsquo;Celery Doctrine&rsquo; a &lsquo;foetid bowel movement cast in the face of honor, truth and decency&rsquo; and within days found himself wanted for consorting with dark powers naked in a petting zoo; Vashir got his first taste of the crafts of deception in practice at age 12, and he felt more than a tiny flicker of terrible glee at the look in Stonerune&rsquo;s face when Vashir assumed in court the role of a terrified 8-year-old child pointing at the Bad Man Who Touched Me Down There.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal">Stonerune&rsquo;s rather complex personal philosophical code had decided, during a trial which could best be described as a slippery slope lined with the blood of domestic animals, that it needed a corollary along the lines of &lsquo;not being there.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In a way, Stonerune has the Narharis to thank for not being in the city when it caught fire &ndash; but it&rsquo;s relatively unlikely Stonerune will actually be grateful if he finds Vashir.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Alignment: NE<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Vashir fits the definition of Out For Himself-type Neutral Evil. He holds no philosophical commitment to evil of which he is aware, but like any decent feline he doesn&rsquo;t care one whit for the suffering of others (at least, of any non-Rakshasa) or in causing it, if that suffering increases his quality of life overall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
