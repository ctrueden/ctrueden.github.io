        <p><b id="w1rf3">Setting:</b></p>
<p>Parallel worlds linked by &quot;tethers&quot; that allow/force sentient beings to cross over.<br id="w1rf7" />
Certain attributes of particular worlds can spread like a virus. Mmm, brains.<br id="w1rf8" />
Some kind of epic war going on (just for John Pawley :-D -- see DMG p. 137 &quot;War&quot; blurb).<br id="hrgz" />
Nexuses are highly contested resources (one of the reasons for the war).</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" id="tl6p0" />
<p><b id="w1rf11">Themes:</b></p>
<p><i id="d4ff0">Every action has a consequence. What is done cannot be undone.<br id="sm-p0" />
</i>It'll be a little tricky to establish this theme, but I think it can be done. Many times, even though in theory you could find a world where your wife didn't leave you, it just does not realistically happen. Maybe never. Perhaps those who are wise realize such things, and look upon the actions of those who seek out the tremors as folly. This trope has been done a lot in time travel scenarios, however, and may be too banal.</p>
<p><i id="d4ff1">Life is fragile; memory is transient.<br id="w1rf14" />
</i>Easy to establish, of course. We should explore ways other than the obvious for this theme to manifest, though. Perhaps one of the gods has lost its memory. Perhaps they all have.</p>
<p><i>People are selfish. You can't rely on anyone, even yourself.<br id="gweu" />
</i>Too negative? But easily established in a war setting with competing factions, all of whom have flaws and selfish motives. And easily established in a setting where your own memory can be untrustworthy. Also helps if the gods themselves are selfish as well.</p>
<hr size="2" id="hrgz1" />
<p><b id="gweu0">Goals:</b></p>
<p>1) Establish that a world with this shock (the tremors) can be &quot;better&quot; than one without it. Make the ultimate goal of the campaign <i id="d9ds">stopping</i> a villain from destroying the clone worlds, and thus ending the tremors. The goal should<i id="p6ci"> not </i>be to &quot;heal&quot; the worlds, as many would feel the world does not need such treatment. Perhaps some scientists want to isolate and control the tremors, just as many want to extend lifespan in real life, but there is at least great disagreement on whether the tremors are ultimately a good thing (just as there is disagreement in real life on whether we should &quot;cure&quot; old age to reach for immortality as individuals).</p>
<p>2) Give the PCs freedom in &quot;choosing their poison&quot; with which faction they choose. Give them three or more competing factions, and whoever they help has a better chance of emerging triumphant. Avoid predetermining the war storyline, to ensure that PCs' actions really make a difference in the outcome. But make sure every action has consequences, in keeping with the themes -- every faction should have some negative characteristics.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;" id="tl6p1" />
<p><b id="w1rf16">Questions:</b></p>
<p>Q: What is the source of the tremors?</p>
<p>Q: Where did this technology come from? Maybe it has something to do with the D&amp;D pantheon.</p>
<p>Q: How are the D&amp;D planes related? Ethereal, astral sea, nine hells, elemental chaos...<br id="w1rf24" />
A: The inner planes are tied to each world's Material. The astral sea is the glue that holds everything together, so to speak -- anyone on the astral is on *the* astral. But it is infinite in scope, so you wouldn't encounter another version of yourself there unless you went looking. The nine hells and elemental chaos are also singular, and tied to Prime somehow.</p>
<p>Q: Are the shifts limited to sentient beings? Or can terrain shift too? Is there a type of tremor that can effect a more subtle shift in reality itself?<br id="s78c0" />
A: Only living creatures shift. See below for the types of tremors.</p>
<p>Q: How does the war start? How does it explode? In what ways can it end?</p>
<hr size="2" />
<p><b>Game mechanics:</b></p>
<p>If the party is having a difficult time deciding on a course of action, perhaps the players can enact a split -- declare they'd like to do both, and a later tremor divides the world along that decision axis.</p>
<p>I can run multiple groups, working for different factions, but participating in opposite sides of the same conflicts. I can use the results of one faction's session as fuel for what the antagonists will do for the other group, but take liberties in their exact behavior since they are obverse reflections.</p>      </div>
