        <p>DMG p. 67: &quot;Elemental energy surges through a cavern, granting strength to fire-based spells.&quot; Ley lines underground could have elemental consequences... Corrupted ley lines become necrotic instead of the normal types.all ley lines point to the temple of sigil, which is on the biggest nexus</p>
<p>Genasi (FRPG 11) are a great race to tie to the ley lines<br />
Spellplague = disease caused by ley lines beginning to turn?</p>
<p>If some worlds have better control over the tremors and/or the shifting than others do, some villain(s) could be from, or have visited, such &quot;sophisticated&quot; worlds. Maybe they stole some of the technology and can shift between worlds more effectively, or even at will? Maybe they can just force a tremor, and probabilistically control the shift's outcome a bit? Something like that in the wrong hands would be akin to a teenager with a time machine. The course of the war throughout many worlds could be drastically altered by bringing in troops from all over. We could pull a purple tentacle and have the main villain not exist in any world but one, but it is revealed later that actually, he collected a bunch of versions of himself into a secret army at his stronghold.</p>
<p>It may not always be obvious that two people are twins. We could have a big reveal about one of the PCs and one of the big villains actually being obverse twins, as clich&eacute; as that is.</p>
<p>Teleportation circles (DMG p. 156) link major cities. Can the Planar Portal ritual link two separate worlds? Could portals be secretly subverted for such a purpose? PCs might change worlds without even knowing...</p>
<p>DMG p. 157 has some good ideas for &quot;fantastic settlements&quot; and power structures.</p>
<p>The campaign could have a prelude that describes the start of the war, and then skip to ten years later or some such, with the characters having gained a few levels. Doing this would establish some shared memories and NPCs between the characters which we could then manipulate. Also possible would be to split into three segments: a heroic segment, a paragon one, and an epic one, each separated by some space of time.</p>
<p>Bane and Gruumsh are locked in an eternal war (DMG p. 160). The PCs could dream of this place. Speaking of which... what are dreams in this setting? Are they visions of other worlds? The Astral Sea? I like the idea that dreams are real.</p>      </div>
