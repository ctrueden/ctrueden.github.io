        <p>DMG p. 155-6 has some good ideas for combinations of gods and religious aspects. We should decide how each deity and race fits into our cosmology&mdash;this process will enrich and complexify the world, hopefully giving us more plot ideas.</p> <p>Tharizdun (DMG p. 163) is a very important deity in the D&amp;D cosmology, and is thus intimately tied to this campaign world as well.</p> <p>1) Mortal life needs divine essence in order to be sustained. It negatively affects a god's well-being--perhaps causing pain or great discomfort--to give up their essence in such a manner. But the elder gods agreed they wanted to create mortal life. Thus, they chose one among their number to be the &quot;workhorse&quot; who would fuel the mortals. Their choice was Tharizdun. Of course, Tharizdun was not willing to be the red-headed stepchild of the gods, and fought back when the other gods tried to imprison him. One consequence of the conflict is that Tharizdun created the elemental chaos [figure this out better]. Nonetheless, the other elders successfully imprisoned Tharizdun, sealing away his power and linking it to ley lines in the earth, so that their newly created mortals might freely feed upon his essence.</p> <p>2) The ley lines act as chains, binding Tharizdun to his prison. He feels great anguish from his divine essence constantly being tapped, and cannot help but struggle against his bonds. When he struggles particularly hard, he causes a tremor that splits reality in twain, fissioning the world in two, resulting in even more ley lines that bind him even more strongly. This is the nature of his prison. [Thus, when mortals draw a larger-than-normal amount of essence from the ley points, they may induce a tremor. Plot point!]</p> <p>3) If all the ley lines of a particular world are destroyed, that world is no longer part of Tharizdun's prison, and thus cannot be split from his struggles. These are &quot;dead worlds&quot; from which mortals cannot draw sustenance.</p> <p>4) Azmodeus, more recently come to power, is not one of the elder gods. He was not part of the decision to imprison Tharizdun, but he has learned of it. He has also managed to gain control over Moradin somehow [figure out how]. He has teamed with Tiamat, who slew Bahamut centuries ago [define this event better], to advance their agenda upon the world. Azmodeus offered humanity a deal, power in exchange for service, transforming them into tieflings. A fraction of the elves took advantage of a similar deal as well, becoming drow. The tieflings and the drow now live underground, forced to taint ley lines in order to derive sustenance. The ley lines, normally exuding positive energy, become converted to negative energy. [So in this setting, tieflings and drow function as undead for the purposes of positive/negative energy.]</p> <p>5) This negative energy flow corrodes the chains, eventually destroying them. [Either that, or the dragonborn/dwarven clerics have a &quot;cleansing&quot; process that destroys them, rather than leaving them tainted -- which do we like better?] This phenomenon is, in fact, part of Azmodeus's plot. He wants to destroy the ley lines on a particular world, so that he can freely demand servitude from all the mortals there -- as without ley lines, their only option for survival is to embrace the dragonborn/dwarven solution, drawing sustenance from Moridin, who Azmodeus has somehow coerced into providing this service [Figure out Azmodeus's leverage over Moridin]. Once the mortals have no other choice, Azmodeus is free to reveal his hand and demand whatever he wishes from the mortals.</p> <p>6) The dragonborn and dwarves are unwittingly serving Azmodeus's goals. By conquering territory, they allow him to extend his &quot;protection&quot; over it, which primes it for taint from the tieflings and drow. The dragonborn/dwarves sometimes &quot;get there just in time&quot; to protect the world from ley lines that have &quot;gone bad.&quot; This phenomenon of taint is the reason Moridin and &quot;Bahamut&quot; have officially given for why the ley lines must no longer be used: it is a sickness that must not be allowed to spread, they say.</p> <p>7) Azmodeus has already conquered a number of worlds in this fashion. The problem is that once he fully destroys all the ley lines, he cannot split that eidolon anymore. So he plays a game where he gets within an inch of his goal, then attempts to clone the eidolon as many times as possible to maximize his harvest. He uses the eladrin/gnome faction for this, inducing them to draw very heavily from the (ideally) one remaining ley point, so that Tharizdun maximally struggles. Seeing as how he has been iterating this process for several centuries, some eidolons have been &quot;on the brink&quot; for a very long time.</p> <p>8) Thus far, there has been very few worlds [perhaps only one?] that managed to defy Azmodeus during their downfall. After the last ley line was destroyed on this world, and the tremors stopped, Azmodeus announced his dominion, and the people were ordered to worship him. As usual, they defied him for a time, but on the eidolon in question a charismatic leader managed to raise a substantial force to oppose this iniquity. They refused to worship Azmodeus, choosing to wither instead. They slew any craven enough to cave to Azmodeus's order -- it was the world's last great war, but the leader's side emerged victorious. Those who remained mostly took their own lives, but some withered to death, transforming into undead (which is what happens in that circumstance). Most people become zombies, but some more powerful (higher level) people become more intelligent undead. Normally, these undead would be &quot;locked&quot; onto their current eidolon, since the world no longer tremors, but if someone were to reform a conduit to the eidolon, many disgruntled undead, waiting there for an eternity for revenge, would be waiting... Azmodeus has learned from his mistake, and has thus far avoided such a scenario on any other conquered worlds. (I.e., he blames his own imperfect machinations for what happened with the zombie world.)</p> <hr /> <p>Lady of Pain was a version of Lucifer, granted divinity by Tharizdun as his final defiant act. She was forced by the gods to become the Lady of Pain and serve as his eternal jailer.</p> <hr /> <p>first devils were humans who died?</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> was the leader of the rebellion&nbsp;(may also use the name&nbsp;&quot;Iblis&quot;?)</p> <p>when someone dies from their divine essence snuffing out, their soul becomes a devil</p> <p>if you die in another way (e.g., murdered), your soul is judged by the raven queen</p> <p>1. Prime splits into two.</p> <p>2. Gods are very shocked by this turn of events. They investigate the phenomenon, and figure out what's going on. Some try to kill each other, some work together... it's a mess. But a few gather on world 1 to build a temple to consolidate their divine power on a single world.</p> <p>3. Very shortly before the temple is completed, the two worlds split again. There are now four worlds, with nearly completed temples on worlds 1 and 3. Chained god, in final effort, bestows godhood on loyal human leader, Lucifer A. Lucifers B, C and D feel left out.</p> <p>4. Temple 1 is completed, and ritual to cement prime as the center of the universe is enacted.</p> <p>5. As the temple is completed, Lucifer B jumps to world 3, and Lucifer A, now divine and hunted by the gods, jumps to world 2.</p> <p>6. However, the ritual triggered another huge tremor. Worlds 2, 3 and 4 split again, but world 1 is already protected. Worlds 2', 3' and 4' are created, and all worlds 2, 3 and 4 become linked. Thus, world 3 has Lucifers B &amp; C, and world 3' has Lucifers B' &amp; C'. In world 3, Lucifer C kills Lucifer B and absorbs his essence, because Lucifer B is disoriented. In a spur of the moment decision, Lucifer C' decides NOT to kill Lucifer B', thinking perhaps they'll be more powerful together. But on both worlds, Lucifer(s) somehow uses the temple as a focus to &quot;steal&quot; permanent divine essence from the chained god, gaining what he wanted but felt denied. Lucifer C =&gt; Asmodeus, Lucifer B'+C' =&gt; Demogorgon.</p> <p>7. Demogorgon levels temple 3', to prevent anyone else from using it.</p> <p>8. Meanwhile on world 2, Lucifer A is recaptured by the gods, and forced to transform into Kiaransalee, the Lady of Pain. But on world 2', Lucifer A' avoids this fate, and secretly travels back to Prime, hiding in the newly formed Lady of Pain's necklace. As the millennia pass, she transforms into Ghaunadaur, the One Who Waits. Together with Kiaransalee, they form St. Cuthbert, the personification of vengeance, whose avatar is Kas.</p> <p>9. Back on world 3, Asmodeus curses temple 3 somehow, TBD. Could be the gate to the nine hells, which are nine worlds that Asmodeus has rid of nexuses.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>10. Lucifers D and D' (Iblis and Shaitan)&nbsp;die with the other humans. They each become an archdevil (TBD -- Dispater &amp; Mephistopheles ?), but are ultimately dependent on Asmodeus for divine essence.</p> <p>world fractured twice, for a total of four <br /> levistus is a dwarf -- moradin's twin -- moradin himself is the one in the block of ice<br /> hextor = heironeous</p> <hr /> <p>tieflings are the last surviving remnants of humanity -- they made the deal out of desperation, because they were being exterminated by the other gods.</p> <p>Once it was clear that the humans had lost the war, and they were being exterminated, Lolth (a princess at the time) led a group of elves who opposed the genocide, defying Corellon. But Corellon withdrew his support for Lolth's faction, cursing her similar to the humans.</p> <p>The tieflings, pledged to Asmodeus, are cursed, and can only refresh at inverted nexuses. And the drow were cursed by Corellon similarly as well.Humans are doomed to die, unable to refresh at any nexus.</p> <p>Pure humans are the only race that cannot be replicated, though -- tieflings and drow are still copied across worlds.</p> <p>Lolth is the hag countess. She became very withered before figuring out that she and her people could refresh at corrupted nexuses created by the tieflings. Younger drow are not all withered, but the elders are.</p>      </div>
