Those who are capable of accepting this hatred become new rakshasa.</li></ul><p>Non-humans who withstand the punishment and transform into deva or rakshasa are, in essence, being transformed into humans (since deva &amp; rakshasa are nothing more than corrupted humans). This transformation process is part of the Raven Queen's agenda.</p><p>The act of withering to death is believed to destroy the soul. However, in actuality, the souls of the withered are claimed by Wee Jas, one of her few remaining portfolio powers. She has largely abandoned the mortal realm, and normally meditates in seclusion on the nature of reality itself, but has collected a large amount of mortal essence.</p><p>Nerull is facilitating Wee Jas's collection of (non-human) souls, and together with the Raven Queen, they have assumed many of Wee Jas's duties to lessen her burden.</p><p>When Asmodeus claims a "dead world" by inverting the temple itself, he gains the ability to manufacture devils at that temple, using souls from living beings on that world.<br /><br />A human who dies rejoins the shadar kai villages in the land of the dead. Even if a human withers nearly to death, the raven queen reclaims it before its destruction.</p>      </div>
