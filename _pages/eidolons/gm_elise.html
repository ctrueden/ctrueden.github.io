        <p>Did Gwenvyth kill Arcelmon (Lorinal Noroelwa's father)? No. Actually, Joseph did. Or rather, he withered him to within an inch of his life. Th Arcelmon told his trusted family members what had happened&mdash;who had done this to him&mdash;and then took his own life in shame. Thus, the Noroelwas are now Joseph's sworn enemies, should he ever set foot in the city.</p>      </div>
