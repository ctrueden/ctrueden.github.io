        <p>Initial Blue players</p>
<p>andy – Simone<br />
jeff – Biger<br />
jesse – Isaline<br />
john – Ed<br />
mark – Joseph<br />
paul – Kith</p>
<hr />
<p>Initial idea:&nbsp;traveling deep into the wilderness to locate the temple.</p>
<p>Simone is there to find Kith.</p>
<p>Isaline is there to protect the city; receives message from Marquis telling her to go and find the Temple.&nbsp; All Dragonborn, at moment of Emperor's death, receive a vision of the temple and the pain of their god at being stabbed.&nbsp; Marquis gets the same, but understands that something is -very wrong- with "Bahamut".&nbsp; Sends a sending to Isaline immediately:&nbsp; "Something of immense power lies within the jungle.&nbsp; You must seek it out and discover the threat it poses.&nbsp; Trust no one of the Empire."</p>
<p>Kith is there to kill the Emperor.</p>
<p>Ed is not there.&nbsp; He is rusting out in the jungle.</p>
<p>Joseph needs to be talked to about involvement with everything.</p>
<p>Biger may be connected to the captain of the guard somehow?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Simone<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>She has spent the last few months running errands in the Underdark. She has gotten to know the Dark group, including Cameron, who inducted her into the Guild and assigned her a vital task:&nbsp;locate the mysterious place where the Sword could potentially unravel the world.&nbsp;(Cameron asks Iraja to share the vision with Simone.)</p>
<p>Simone is sent to Eloyes to obtain the services of Kith as well as provide him with the scroll giving him information about Melora.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Isaline &amp;&nbsp;Biger<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Notes from Jesse:</strong>&nbsp;So I was talking to Jeff at game night yesterday and came up with an event where our characters would have at least been introduced.&nbsp; In my background I talked about the siege of the former free city.&nbsp; If it would work that could be moved from a year+ ago to being a major event within the last month or so before the campaign starts.&nbsp; Jeff said that it would work that&nbsp;back when he was constructed there was a Technoprophet city/town, replaced by a free city, and now being rebuilt as an Imperial Citadel that now he tries to return home to find an army of a nation he's never heard of now inhabits the ruins of his hometown.&nbsp; If you guys don't want to use that hook at all feel free to use that siege as a much more current event to show the power/expansionism of the Empire (for whom I'm still trying to come up with a good name) or to drive an early plot.</p>
<p><strong>Notes from Jeff:&nbsp;</strong>Right. &nbsp;So from my end, it would be my character's hometown, which he's slowly worked his way back to. &nbsp;This would give him a good idea of where he was (Though he probably had to travel quite a ways to find it, still) and how much time (A lot) had passed.</p>
<p>[Need a hook for these two to stay together, travel together, and pursue a common goal.]</p>
<p>The day the Emperor is assassinated, before it happens, Isaline gets a note from her patron, Marquis Gustav Brehem, instructing her to find a very important place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ed<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>He was sent deep into the Feywood and even the Jungle to map out the nexuses. When the party travels there, they will run across him, deactivated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Joseph<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>He wanders out of the wastes and to the same town where Isaline and Biger are. He meets up with them, and they begin traveling together.</p>
<p>[Need a hook for Joseph to remain with the group.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kith<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>He kills Emperor Dardanos&nbsp;(the Peacekeeper) with the Sword of&nbsp;Kas, and narrowly escapes. All the Dragonborn of the world feel the pain as&nbsp;Bahamut (Tiamat).</p>
<p>Simone sees the weapon around Kith's head, since it was in his recent past, and recognizes it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of session 1, something triggers a quake and Isaline switches places with Sahrit (who switches polarities).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Miscellaneous notes<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Begin play in Eloyes. The Emperor has been here, engaged in talks with the former city rulers, trying to smooth things over.</p>
<p>Kith -- just killed Dardanos, the city is in chaos. Simone finds him.</p>
<p>Isaline -- still enforcing order in Eloyes, and rebuilding the city guard, etc. Receives note from Marquis saying, "There is a task of the utmost importance. I have recently become aware of a place of untold power, upon which the future of the world may rest.</p>
<p>Simone -- Cameron told her to stay in Eloyes to make sure that Kith does the job, and if so, to help him escape. That is her first task. (She sees Kith's past flow, including the sword, so he is pretty unmistakable to her.) She is to give Kith a scroll.</p>
<p>When he reads it, it gives him a vision of the moment of Melora's death. He sees her standing before a man in robes embroidered with a large symbol (which with some research he can identify as Boccob's). The man exudes an aura of wisdom, serenity, patience and understanding. To the man's left, from the shadows, steps a masked horror, nine feet tall, wrapped in black chains. The figure is clearly female, but the only natural visible part of her is her jet black hair. As she approaches Melora, the chains animate and like blades rip Melora apart with no apparent difficulty. The vision fades.</p>
<p>Simone's second task is to find the mysterious place of power, recruiting Kith to help her. She is supposed to tell him that her goals are compatible with his, but is not supposed to tell him about the Guild yet.</p>      </div>
