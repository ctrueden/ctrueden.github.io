<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Priscilla<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Priscilla is approached by one of the thieves guild to perform a service:&nbsp;escort a large group of travelers&nbsp;(a horde tribe)&nbsp;through the city in the dead of night, to the teleporter on the north side of town. She will receive a large sum of money in exchange, as well as an Olidammara-bound Oath that the tribe will do no harm to Arx or any other Delphia city. Her job will be to ensure they are not seen, and to kill anyone who happens across their path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rupert<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Rupert may catch Priscilla in her treasonous act, if he is trailing her when she sneaks out that night.&nbsp;(She is staying with Rupert's house for the time being, as a student.)</p>
<p>If Rupert reports the incident back to his mother, she and Priscilla's house jointly arrange for Priscilla and Rupert to be sent out of the city for a while while they "clean up their mess."&nbsp;If he says nothing, his mother calls him in anyway and starts with an innocent tack:&nbsp;"Did you hear what happened last night?" And then, if he denies, she hisses:&nbsp;"You were SEEN." He will hopefully spill his guts about Priscilla at that point, at which point they are still both sent out of the city.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, they are leaving as part of the protectorate for a lineship carrying important cargo to the outpost. (Lineships are large armored vehicles/ships that are more effective against angry hordes. They are generally used to transport goods from a technoprophet city to an area without a teleportation circle.) If that doesn't work for some reason, Rupert's dwarven mentor is also being sent as part of the guard. And for Priscilla, many powerful undead are being assigned as guards, and she is specifically asked to ensure their continued cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sahrit</strong></span></p>
<p><em>[Question for Nate:&nbsp;Did he tell Kelsey that Kas is female? Kelsey has Kas noted on his page as male.]<br />
</em></p>
<p>Upon arriving at Arx, if he asks around, he hears about some mysterious woman who died and then disappeared outside the city gates. <em>[Kas was grievously injured after the incident, brought the sword to Arx and died at the city walls. The guards bring in the sword, and the technoprophets study it for the next several months.]</em></p>
<p>He decides to masquerade as a traveling performer staying for the season at Rupert's house, whose family acts as his patron, so he has gotten to know Rupert &amp;&nbsp;Priscilla a bit, but not intimately.</p>
<p>Months later, he hears a rumor about the Sword of Kas. He hears that it has been in the city for the past few months, right under his nose. Gather info, some janitor knows about some super-secret research going on with his employer; he caught a glimpse of a sword floating over a pedestal once through an open door marked "authorized personnel only." If he rolls well enough on the info check, the janitor also says he heard his employer saying something about&nbsp;"it" being moved soon.</p>
<p>Then, when he hears that Rupert and Priscilla are suddenly leaving the city to guard a suspicious lineship carrying crucial cargo&nbsp;(when "crucial cargo" is normally teleported—make an Int check), Sahrit figures it is his best lead.</p>
<p>He is also probably interested in Priscilla's undead-related abilities, as they remind him so much of his own, which he still does not understand.</p>
<p>He has been switching back and forth between good and evil for the past few months, and has gotten the hang of it, but it has never affected his geographic position up until now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Haroun<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>It has been three months and seven days since Haroun was mysteriously "rescued"&nbsp;from his "predicament." After wandering the Wastes for a time and nearly dying, he came upon the free city of Tat'enda, where he made friends with Arwel and Za'hran, who agreed to hide him for a time. Unfortunately though, he could not join them in their exploits, but remained in hiding at the hostel. He did go out to explore the city occasionally, where he became good friends with Ragbund, a shady character who knows Tat'enda like the back of his hand, and has agreed to keep an ear to the ground in case anyone comes asking around for him. Recently, Haroun learns that Ragbund has managed to steer a cheerful well-to-do dwarf—who introduced himself as Gawain—in the wrong direction, but Ragbund cautions that Gawain will eventually wise up and come back, looking for answers.</p>
<p>While still in hiding, with Arwel and Za'hran are preparing to leave on their latest mission, Haroun experiences a strange prophecy when he shakes Za'hran's hand goodbye. The hand clenches his, and Za'hran's nails grow into cat claws. His nose elongates into a snout, and his face sprouts fur. His mouth snarls. With a successful geomancy roll&nbsp;(20?), he interprets this prophecy: Za'hran will face a coming darkness, which he must overcome, or risk being overwhelmed by it. If he does well enough&nbsp;(30?), he also senses that Za'hran has been seeking something, his&nbsp;"other self,"&nbsp;and may find it on his coming journey.</p>
<p>When he touches Arwel&nbsp;(maybe he shakes her hand, maybe he stumbles, etc.), her face shifts too. In her non-shield hand, she grasps a sword, which she raises aloft as her features change to look like someone eerily familiar to Haroun:&nbsp;it is one of the people who broke his shell! The sword glows with a With a successful geomancy roll (25?), Haroun knows that that sword lies in Arwel's future, and that the sword once belonged to Haroun's (wo?)man "rescuer" <em>[Kas]</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At the outpost<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Once all parties reach the outpost, and the lineship arrives, the hordes attack! The lineship has defenses, and the outpost itself has defenses, but... mass combat cliffhanger! And there is a quake, and&nbsp;Sahrit disappears, replaced with&nbsp;Isaline!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dark group characters will act as enemy generals, as will the Vanquisher.</p>
<p>If the Red group succeeds, the Sword is safe. If not, the Sword is taken, and the Emperor is subsequently killed.</p>      </div>
