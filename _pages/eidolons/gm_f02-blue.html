        <p>After the quake that introduces Sahrit, the flow is high. Simone's visions of the past are especially potent for the next few hours. Camping at a nexus that night, as she stares at her companions...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Simone's visions<br /></strong></span></p><p>Simone takes the lead, since everybody is inclined to listen to her. She sees everyone's various pasts through the flow... they all share something highly unusual in common:&nbsp;"fountains" of life energy (in bold face)—unusual people, unusual quakes or both. And another common thread throughout most of them:&nbsp;inexplicable missing pieces (in italics).</p><ul><li>Biger – His past lens is normal, except for a large crack through it [from when the crank was turned]<br /><ul><li>Like most warforged, Biger's past lens is quite narrow, though less narrow than most.</li><li>Simone sees his history as a performer, traveling to other cities to deliver messages and perform. She sees a cleric of Olidammara&nbsp;sneakily turn the crank, at the <em>sharp edge of the lens fragment</em>.</li><li>Simone sees him being built, taking shape, by Yolarlen Budonga and her team.</li><li>Sees a <strong>small, gold-cloaked figure</strong> attach a crank to Biger's torso in the night, after the workers had gone home.</li></ul></li><li>Wrin –  Past lens is extremely narrow, and focused.<br /><ul><li>Very short lifespan in its current form.</li><li>Reads as an object, rather than a person.</li><li>Sees flashes of a <strong>gnome with golden hands</strong>, wearing a welding mask, feverishly welding.</li></ul></li><li>Ed – Past is much more varied than normal.<ul><li>This warforged has played a thousand roles in past years. Spy, warrior, thief, magician, warlord, madman, ascetic, leader, priest... but always highly skilled at what it does—never a beggar, except by choice.</li><li>One thing quite clear through the lens is repeated battles with a much tougher-looking warforged clearly a size category larger than him. This warforged is often present, either by Ed's side or in opposition to him, as the memories flow by.</li><li>One such vision that stands out is the two warforged journeying through the Feywood together, along with an eladrin woman. And then, a <strong>quake</strong>... and she is gone, a gnomish flying machine in her place.</li><li>Many scenes of Beta training with a small, agile-looking elven woman. Some brief flashes of Beta fighting this woman in the city streets, as well as him striking a woodsman with a devastating blow...</li><li>Lastly, scenes of Beta being built and rebuilt many times by two gleeful little gnomes.</li></ul></li><li>Joe –  Unlike everyone else, past is crystal clear.<br /><ul><li>Simone sees a village of other humans.</li><li>Village is obscured, as though the world itself is a shadow. Can't tell if it's real, or an illusion.</li><li>Sees flashes of Joe on a quiet night, but <em>cannot see who he is with</em>. Feels a <strong>massive quake</strong>, and the villagers scatter to the winds.</li><li>That quake felt unique—except for the recent one that swapped Isaline with Sahrit.</li></ul></li><li>Kith –  Portions of his past are obscured, as though by protective magics.<ul><li>Can't see the Emperor-murderin' due to the nondetection at the time.</li><li>Sees Kith engaging in back alley deals with a dirty man with alcohol on his breath.</li><li>Something is funny about the dirty man; feels familiar somehow.</li><li>Sees Kith wounded and unconscious, a young girl leaning over his tiny form and wiping his sweating brow.</li><li>Sees Kith in a cage, in a beautiful dark palace (Zelatar?), surrounded by monstrous forms poking at him through the bars, sneers of admiration and envy on their faces. Upon a fearsome throne sits a <strong>handsome yet terrible satyr</strong>... and flashes of terrible sexual rites that no one should ever have to endure...</li><li>Sees pieces of Kith's escape, but <em>cannot see Kas</em>. Just flashes of Kith's cage smashing to the ground.</li></ul></li><li>Sahrit –  Past is sharply split in half&nbsp;(like glasses for two eyes, with different prescriptions), though still many similarities.<ul><li>Sees flashes of the Fochlucan incident, but <em>cannot see Kas</em>. Just flashes of <span style="font-weight: bold;">human in a dark brown cloak</span><strong>'s</strong> face and his hand branding Sahrit.</li><li>Sees a brief flash of Sahrit in ecstasy, but strangely <em>cannot see the woman he is with</em>.</li><li>In one lens eye, sees an eladrin woman giving birth. The same <strong>human in a dark brown cloak</strong> watches as the halfling midwife urges her along. When it is over, the man caresses the exhausted mother's cheek, and Simone senses something dark and malevolent pass through his hand and into her body.</li><li>In the other lens eye, simultaneously, Simone sees an elven woman giving birth, with the <strong>same human in a dark brown cloak</strong> watching as the same halfling midwife takes her through it. Afterward, the man caresses the mother's cheek, but this time with genuine tenderness and no apparent ill effect.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vance speaks to Sahrit in a dream<br /></strong></span></p><p>Vance comes to Sahrit in a dream that night, and speaks frankly to his son about the dangers of the Wilds. Asks Sahrit to join his cause, for mutual power and benefit. If confronted about the Fochlucan incident, Vance claims to have bestowed his power upon Sahrit intentionally (a lie).</p><p>Vance is annoyed with Joe—doesn't understand Joe's abilities. Asks Sahrit to watch him, and possibly kill him in the future if he seems like a threat.</p><p>Vance knows secrets, but could not track Kas when she ran off. He only learned her whereabouts after her death (heard the rumors between guardsmen).</p><p>Knows Kith was responsible for the Sword's destruction. Wants to know who Kith is working for.</p><p>Vance doesn't care too much about Simone, Ed or Biger.</p><p>Vance informs&nbsp;Sahrit of a message, sent in secret from a powerful cleric:&nbsp;"Something of immense power lies within the jungle.&nbsp; You must seek it out and discover the threat it poses.&nbsp; Trust no one of the Empire." Vance warns him: "The usurper knows this as well, now. And he knows of this conversation. You best find this power before his agents do, boy. I will find the Sword."</p><p>"Now wake up, before your so-called allies get you killed."</p><p>Sahrit wakes abruptly, and sees the first snarling orc emerge from the glowing nexus...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>During the night<br /></strong></span></p> <p>Pseudonatural orcs (using <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/ogre.htm">ogre barbarians</a> with the pseudonatural template from Complete Arcane page 160), eyes glowing with nexus saturation, jump out of the nexus and attack the party.</p><ul><li>Four emerge initially.</li><li>After 1-2 rounds, and every round thereafter, more emerge from the nexus (1d4 at a time; can be fudged based on party's performance).</li><li>8 HD:&nbsp;98 vp, with 26 wp</li><li>Pseudonatural template:<br /><ul><li><em>True strike</em> 1/day&nbsp;(Su)</li><li>acid &amp;&nbsp;electricity resistance 10</li><li>DR 5/magic</li><li>SR 18</li><li>Tentacled form causes all attackers to suffer -1 morale penalty to attack rolls vs the "orcs"</li></ul></li></ul><p>Platypus warrior (a scout)&nbsp;comes to their defense?</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>      </div>
