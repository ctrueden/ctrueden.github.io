        <p>Everyone meets outside Mordollwen's palace!</p><p>Mordollwen, Priestess of the Black, demands the Sword from them. She agrees to spare their lives and send half of them on their journey to where they want to go. In exchange, the other half must assist her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blue – those continuing the quest <br /></strong></span></p><p>The party must divide themselves in half, with no more than six allowed to continue their journey into the Wilds. Mordollwen teleports those who continue on their quest to Terminus, and instructs them to follow the Yara river northward into the Wilds, all the way to its source. She also stresses that it is a suicide mission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Red – those assisting Mordollwen<br /></strong></span></p><p>Those who have agreed to assist Mordollwen must swear an Oath on Tiamat: "We will slay the Frost Giant King and deliver his body to the Priestess of the Black."</p><p>Mordollwen: "I will transport you to the lair of the Priestess of the Red. You must convince her to let you go, and secure her help in killing the Frost Giant King. She possesses a weapon capable of doing this, without which you are surely doomed. She will want something of great value in return—appeasing her is your responsibility. My only requirement is that you are not to mention my involvement in any of this."</p><p>Narylfiel, the Priestess of the Red makes them swear another oath to return the artifact: "We will return the Wand of Meteor Swarm in perfect condition after our task is complete. We will deliver the Frost Giant King's hammer to the Priestess of the Red at the same time."</p><p>She lends them the Wand of Meteor Swarm. She agrees to teleport them to the camp.</p><p>They are teleported directly to the Frost Giant King and his court as he is feasting in a massive tent!</p>      </div>
