        <p>While Isaline is on the shadow path, she receives a raven messenger from Corvidae! And the message cannot be intercepted by Vecna, because this plane is the domain of the Raven Queen. The message reads:</p><blockquote><p>Dear Isaline,</p><p>Apologies for my silence, but I have been dead for the past five years. At that time, Soren van Wagram assassinated me when I uncovered proof, in the form of a letter, that he was responsible for the murder of Marquis Frederick. I also learned that he is a member of a necromantic cult, and apparently possesses significant power in that regard. Van Wagram is extremely dangerous—do not confront him until you can strike from a position of strength.</p><p>Since my death I have discovered that Van Wagram's plots extend significantly farther than either of us had thought. In my prior communication I mentioned a place of great power in the Wilds. I have received confirmation that Van Wagram and his ilk now seek this place as well. Thus, I urge you to find it before he and his allies do.</p><p>Your path will lead you to a person knowledgeable about the Wilds, and thus capable of assisting in this regard. But beware: she is a deadly enemy if crossed, and will require much from you and your allies in exchange for her help. Best of luck in your endeavours—I do not exaggerate when I say that the fate of the world may hang in the balance of your actions. I sincerely hope we will meet again one day.</p><p>With warmest regards,<br />Corvidae</p><p>P.S. I've taken the liberty of reviving your slain ally. Give my regards to Barnabas.</p></blockquote><p>After they reach the end of the path, they find themselves in a swamp, where they meet a strange woman. The green hag pretends to be the oracle (disguise self) surrounded by two glowing balls of light&nbsp;(actually will-o'-wisps), but when the party drops their guard, she and her allies attack them:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/hag.htm#greenHag">Green Hag</a>—strength damage with a touch: 2d4 (DC 16 Fort negates)</li><li><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/willOWisp.htm">Will-O'-Wisp</a> x2—shock 2d8 electricity</li><li><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/chuul.htm">Chuul</a> x2—hit with claw, get free grapple</li><li><a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/hydra.htm">Eight-Headed Hydra</a> x1—attack with all heads! and AoO!</li></ul><p>After defeating these guardians, they see the magnificant palace visible through the murk in the distance. This is Mordollwen's palace.</p><p>See <a href="/eidolons/gm/joint/4">Session 4:&nbsp;Joint</a> for details after this point.</p>      </div>
