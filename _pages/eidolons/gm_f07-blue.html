Some argue that they could finally beat back the Empire with this army, preserving their way of life. Others argue that they cannot trust the demons not to turn on them at the opportune moment.</p><hr /><p>When Sahrit tries to switch: it doesn't work, and he feels overwhelmed by some force of purity on the other side -- he feels the hand retreat ever so little from its journey towards his heart (regains one corruption point), and switches to Good.</p><hr /><p>Once they take the flying machine: 3 young adult green dragons hassle them on their way.</p><p>Eventually it stops working because it cannot withstand the wild magic.</p>      </div>
