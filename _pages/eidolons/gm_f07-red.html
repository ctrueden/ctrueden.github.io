        <p><strong>Ri the Nomad</strong></p><p>Vision of a frozen lake, with a man in the center... that shifts and stirs as though alive... and then opens its eyes. "The task of my salvation falls to you, my son..." His life essence rises from him, but instead of dissipating, it enters his mother's pendant!</p><hr /><p><strong>Brian guest star<br /></strong><br />Brian is waiting at the Priestess of the Red's. Will be told that she is sending mighty heroes in her stead to heed the Empire's call.<br /><br />Brian is a warforged (!) who serves the Empire: Tuan Hun-Gurrr. He is Arwel's master who trained her, but in an alternate reality where Tat'enda was absorbed by the Empire.<br /><br />Tuan recalls training Arwel and Tudor, since all youth were required to undergo basic military training. In his memory, Arwel became a paladin (of Bahamut) according to the wishes of her mother. But Tudor disappeared a few years ago, never to return.<br /><br />Tuan tells the group: "'The emperor summons you on an urgent matter.'"<br /><br />Sahrit tries to switch in to Red, but it fails. However, Arwel shows up, and Ed switchesswitches in to Red with Arwel.</p><hr /><p>Rory Beardthicket runs his plan of collapsing all the nexuses by the Emperor, the Emperor agrees, having been forewarned by Bahamut during his death experience of this eventuality. He realizes the other clerics of his order will not support his decision, and that power will likely be wrested from him, probably by the Marquis of Elyria -- the dwarf Soren van Wagram.<br /><br />The Emperor will reveal the existence of the Underdark to his trusted lieutenants, to allow them the chance to prepare for what he assumes will be the coming attack.<br /><br />Rory: "Moradin's will will be served."<br /><br />Boris appears from invisible after Rory leaves, as a tiefling. "My people will not stand for this. They will declare war -- does this not concern you?"<br /><br />The Emperor looks pained but resolute: "It is Bahamut's will."<br /><br />Boris: "You will rue this day." And a minor quake (in the Empire!!) as Boris jumps into the dormant ley line in the ground.<br /><br />After he's gone: Emperor: "I have no doubt."<br /><br />Emperor is disappointed that the Priestess of the Red has ignored his summons. However, when he recognizes Za'har he decides to trust these "mighty heroes" and implore them to discover which among the marquis are true, and which are false.</p><hr /><p><strong>Marquis of Niflheim<br /></strong><br />Was a deva dragon knight, one of the generals. He tamed a white dragon and rode it into battle against the Wendigo: a fearsome beast at the center of the frozen wood. He slew it, but took grievous injury, and as its dying curse, it vowed that magic will never again touch his flesh. So he cannot be healed, and is wheelchair-bound. He never leaves the manor, but rules Niflheim from within. As such, he always sends his seneschal to meetings with the Emperor.<br /><br />The Durus Guildmaster has wooed the former knight shortly after his accident by "nursing him back to health," gaining his confidence. His legs would have healed, but he has been continuously issued a debilitating poison since then. As he weakens, he delegates more and more responsibilities to his wife and his seneschal.</p><hr /><p><strong>Marquis of Elyria<br /></strong><br />This is Soren van Wagram!</p><hr /><p><strong>Marquis of Valhalla<br /></strong><br />?</p><hr /><p><strong>Marquis of Midgard<br /></strong><br />?</p>      </div>
