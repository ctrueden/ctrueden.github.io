He is fighting the <a href="/eidolons/people/vanquisher">Vanquisher</a> when the party arrives!</p><p>During that fight, Rory Beardthicket sprints out of sequestered nexus, past some very confused Norns, followed by a bunch of demons. The demons declare that by Delphia's hand, the Empire will fall.&nbsp;The Vanquisher's attention will focus on the demons, as they are more dangerous foes.</p> <p>After the fight, Rory immediately begins the ritual to collapse the nexus, heedless of being observed.&nbsp;Nadine Torchbearer, a high ranking dragonborn cleric, shows up, and is livid, demanding an explanation. She orders the Norns to take Rory into custody.</p><p>Rory:&nbsp;"I&nbsp;am acting under the Emperor's explicit orders."<br />Nadine:&nbsp;"The Emperor is dead."<br />Leif:&nbsp;"But he is with us still."</p><p>The party can get involved in this clusterfuck if they want....</p><p>Whether Rory is allowed to continue the ritual at this specific location depends on how things play out. Either way, afterward, he teleports away, so he's not captured unless the PCs make a specific attempt to do so.</p><p>Shortly after Rory leaves, a messenger appears with a decree from the Emperor himself, via Dragontamer the spymaster, for the Marquis. After reading it, Bloodletter is stunned, but decides to share the decree with the party:</p><blockquote><p>"Let it be known that I, Emperor Dardanos Peacekeeper, have returned to this world as a ghost, one of the withered. But I&nbsp;am still Bahamut's instrument, and it is His Will that I&nbsp;would proclaim before the people. After many hundreds of years, we have finally discovered the true way to deal with the nexuses. My trusted advisor, Rory Beardthicket, is going about My tasks on My orders.</p><p>"Many of those you would recognize as priests of Bahamut will oppose this course of action, because they have been deceived. The one they know as Bahamut is in actuality his polar opposite, Tiamat, goddess of deceit, lies and greed. She will stop at nothing to see the Empire torn asunder, and has been impersonating our true&nbsp;Lord.</p><p>"I&nbsp;anticipate my destruction at the hands of these heretical priests, but I&nbsp;implore all true citizens of Durus to stand for My ideals and see Bahamut's will done."</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The ousting of the Emperor<br /></strong></span></p><p>While the party is figuring out who to trust, the high clerics of "Bahamut" have learned of the Emperor's secret order to collapse all the nexuses as well. Rory Beardthicket is methodically traveling between nexuses&nbsp;(by geomantic teleportation) and collapsing them one by one. Each one takes about an hour.</p><p>When the party reports back to the Emperor, the high clerics of "Bahamut"&nbsp;are confronting the Emperor about the decree. Four dancing heavy picks surround the Emperor, as he is prepared to fight. The clerics have brought a large number of loyal soldiers, though, and battle commences.</p>      </div>
