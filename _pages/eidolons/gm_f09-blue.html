        <p>BLUE GROUP - Nov 11<br /><br />Who wrote session notes for Blue #6 and #7?<br /><br />Village, chieftain, celebration<br /><br />QUAKE:<br />-LOSE: Isaline, Gwenvyth<br />-GAIN: Rebin, Sahrit<br /><br />PLAYERS: Andy, Jason, Jeff, John, Nate, Ryan<br /><br />Elder Tarrasque must be avoided to get into the Temple itself<br />-Guards the temple's entrance<br />-Is Colossal+ size -- too big to go inside :-)<br />-Has epic pseudonatural template<br />-Can shoot 12 spines per round and use its breath weapon, which is a cone of overcharged positive nexus energy (Fort save DC 30 partial -- half damage and not taking on the pseudonatural properties)<br />-It is chameleonic -- after sniffing for them, it disappears as it readies itself<br /><br />Tower is the one cursed by Asmodeus<br /><br />Simone sees:<br />-Lucifer (Asmodeus) gaining power from the Temple by sitting within the ring at the top of the Spire<br />--describe her as an erinyes without wings; when she gets the powers, wings sprout forth from her back<br />--cursing the temple not part of the vision<br />-Two Lucifers (Demogorgon) merging into one entity, then leveling the temple<br />--the combined being opens some kind of portal within the ring<br />--the ley lines climbing the Spire twist and constrict, and appear as chains of energy -- they squeeze and destroy the spire as she disappears into the portal<br />-"something blocked" around "that woman"<br />-The Temple's construction<br />--Many people in a circle, ley lines weaving together, Spire grows from the ground, vision ends, Simone is blind<br /><br />Writing at the temple is in Primal: a strange mix of Celestial, Abyssal and Infernal. Or rather, perhaps a common ancestor to those... It bears the look of runes of power strung together to form sentences.<br /><br />Wrin:<br />-Looking at Ed, says "inferior model"<br />-Looking at Rebin, says "hate"<br />-Looking at the doors, says "authorized personnel only"<br /><br />Set into the base of the Spire is a massive set of double doors.<br />-Gotta distract the Elder Tarrasque long enough to figure out how to open them<br />-Only gods and Lady of Pain can open the doors<br />-Written above the doors: "Within this place lies the tomb of the Betrayer"<br />-Doors say in Primal: "Only the Gods may enter here"<br />-Three PCs have a slice of divine essence -- if all three touch the doors together, they will react and open<br />-Some PCs are too related to Tharizdun, and will be repelled hard by the doors: Simone, Joe, Za'har, Isaline, Sahrit-without-the-Hand<br /><br />Temple is inhabited by devils, which Asmodeus sent to protect it<br />-Their goal is to kill anyone who enters the temple<br />-They are ready for the party<br />-Asmodeus sends a legion to destroy them utterly<br />-But the Trinity uses an uber-quake to remove most of the devils (and switch some PCs around as usual)<br /><br />Devils remaining after the quake:<br />-4x Barbed Devil<br />-2x Horned Devil<br />-1x Ice Devil<br /><br />Through the doors is a large open chamber. Stone room, roughly square. Several alcoves around the room contain motifs and shrines to various gods.<br />-The far left alcove (far end of the room from the door) has stairs leading downward -- no mural, but words: "All things are possible."<br />-The far right alcove is Lolth's, and has a secret staircase from the Underdark coming up.<br /><br />Gods can observe within 100' x DR of any worship area devoted to them. So all the gods can observe the Temple.<br /><br />Memorials:<br />-Melora: Scenery drawing of a forest clearing, with words: "The Fey will always remember"<br />-Lolth: Figure shrouded in darkness with her back to the mural: "Love brings the fiercest betrayal of all"<br /><br />There are murals/motifs here, portraits of the gods:<br />-Boccob: man in a gray robe, with a look of musing upon his face, stroking his chin thoughtfully, empty-handed<br />-Fharlanghn: old man with a long beard and a walking stick, weathered skin, hand over his brow, looking to the horizon, where the sun is setting<br />-Garl: golden hands, golden eyes, and a golden cape -- flamboyantly dressed, a mischievous grin on his face<br />-Heironeous &amp; Hextor: back to back, but eying each other -- one white stone, one back stone -- white knight and black knight<br />-Kord: human-looking dude with tons of muscles cracking his knuckles, lightning storm above his head (possibly some flaming motorcycles)<br />-Olidammara: this mural has missing stonework in the shape of a man<br />-Pelor: as described when people met him<br />-Vecna: man in a black cloak, shadows hide his face, has a staff -- imagery does NOT indicate a missing eye or hand<br />-Wee Jas: small old woman, bent from age (withered?), carrying a scale, sightless eyes<br /><br />Racial murals:<br />-Bane: fearsome goblin warrior, not muscular but lithe-looking dressed in light armor with a poisoned spear<br />-Corellon: fine-boned man with thin circlet, long blonde hair, raising the long sword in triumph<br />&nbsp;--Sehanine: drawn in the same mural as Corellon, at his side -- silvery hair and eyes, very beautiful, moon behind her head, one of her hands is an animal claw<br />-Erythnul: massive oni clad in hides, red-skinned with horns<br />-Gruumsh: one-eyed orc with a enraged countenance<br />-Io: a multicolored metallic disk (some kind of shrine with both Bahamut and Tiamat symbols) has a jagged edge down the middle<br />-Ioun: placid-looking eladrin who seems to be staring out of the mural<br />-Moradin: regal-looking dwarf with hammer and crown, braided beard and broad grin<br />-Obad-Hai: intense-looking ageless man apparently made out of bark and leaves, with roots weaving through him like veins, similar to a genasi<br />-Yondalla: cheerful looking halfling woman with a sling, leaping<br /><br />NOT PRESENT:<br />-Avandra: new god<br />-Bahamut, Tiamat: aspects of Io<br />-Ehlonna: new, took Melora's place<br />-Erathis: new god, formed from creation of the warforged and Delphian phenomenon<br />-Raven Queen: MYSTERY<br />-Nerull: MYSTERY<br />-St. Cuthbert: MYSTERY<br />-Kiaransalee, the Lady of Pain: NO<br />-Ghaunadaur, the One Who Waits: NO<br />-Asmodeus: new<br />-Demogorgon: new<br /><br />Other words:<br />-Ringed in the holy symbols of all the gods: "This monument marks the first time that the gods come together as one. Let us hope it is not the last."<br /><br />Down the spiral stairs opens into another chamber with a transparent floor of force, and a curved ceiling covered in a thousand points of light connected by glowing lines. Through the floor, a similar dome is visible.<br /><br />At the center of the room is a tracing of light in the form of a rune: "Perspective"<br /><br />Standing on the rune, a musical chime sounds (bards take note). The one standing there is able to move the map with a successful Concentration check.<br /><br />After the party climbs the spiral staircase again, the doors open, and Vance stands in the doorway, his hands outstretched: "My son. I have been looking for you... EVERYWHERE."</p>      </div>
