        <p>RED GROUP - Nov 11<br /><br />Who wrote session notes for Red #7?<br /><br />QUAKE:<br />-LOSE: Rebin, Sahrit<br />-GAIN: Isaline, Gwenvyth<br /><br />PLAYERS: Allen, Elise, Jesse, Kelsey, Mark, Paul<br /><br />Isaline in the Empire:<br />&nbsp;- Van Wagram is a member of the necromancer guild, and a withered vampire<br />&nbsp;- Van Wagram has a fair number of mooks that he has made into withered vampires as well<br />&nbsp;- Van Wagram strikes to discredit her politically, and get her arrested<br />&nbsp;- Most people in the Empire do not remember her<br />&nbsp;- Corvidae is informed that he must help her (from visions from the Raven Queen)<br />&nbsp;- Blackdale is informed (from Vance) that Isaline is to be destroyed<br /><br />Red group helps defend the Emperor from the high priests, one of which is a doppelganger.<br /><br />Marquises perspectives:<br />-Ironheart sides with the priests, because what the Emperor says can't possibly be true. He has brought "Righteous Fury," a Witheredbane greatsword. (His other sword is "Order's Wrath," which is Feybane.)<br />-Bloodletter sides against Ironheart, and believes that killing the Emperor's ghost would still be treason.<br />-Dragontamer sides with the party, because he's heard too much that fits too well with this ludicrous story.<br />-Van Wagram sides with whoever is going to win -- and so sides with the priests.<br /><br />If Red group does poorly, Emperor is destroyed, but returns in 1d4 days.<br />-There should also be a possibility of the priests being able to permanently destroy the Emperor, if the party is stupid.<br />-If they do well, they avert this situation, and he goes into hiding or something.<br />-Two priests of "Bahamut" guarding the door, one of whom is the doppelganger -- he takes the form of one of the Emperor's <br />bodyguards: Tuan Hungurrr.<br /><br />Back in Niflheim:<br /><br />Since a doppelganger is killed, Lyra Dragontamer (the cripple's wife) invites Kith to join the Brethren, and the ritual commences (see Paul secrets page).<br /><br />Give kith a choice to join the guild or not:<br />&nbsp; * invited, ritual is applied, his mentality determines whether it works<br />&nbsp; * if it works, he becomes a doppelganger, and he learns lots of secrets<br />&nbsp; * if it fails, it is because his mentality allows the lady of pain to show up<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o the one who remembers has the sword of kas on him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - mordollwen gave it to him, because it was Tiamat's will (she knows it will hurt them)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o lady of pain grabs it with a chain, kills two of the five guildmasters: Underdark and Empire (Lyra)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o the other three teleport away<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o the lady pulls the sword free from Lyra and presents it to Kith<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o when Kith takes it, there is a quake, and he appears back with the group<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o kith can sense that the sword has absorbed the two doppelgangers' essences<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o after the quake, it has become a tiny longsword<br /><br />After the ritual, it is probable that they will still need another doppelganger. But Kith, being a hunter now, disqualifies Simone (too close to Kith).<br /><br />Someone calls Kith "Child of death"... Corvidae?<br /><br />The party must deal with the aftermath of Lyra's death.</p>      </div>
