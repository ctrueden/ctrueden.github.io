He asked them to come here to give a report on their experiences. </p><p>The mercenaries have changed somewhat from their memories. When questioned, their responses vary, but essentially:</p><ul><li>Hired to protect the nexus from any who attacked the "Norns" (actually Brotherhood replacements).</li><li>Not aware of the Brotherhood's plan in any way.</li><li>One of the "Norns" <strong>was</strong> captured, and Kith recognizes him as being one of the people that the Vanquisher put to death—but he has no memory of participating in any other attack. He was specifically told to operate at this specific location, and protect the geomancers.<ul><li>"Dark nexuses are corrupting the world, and they need to be reordered"</li><li>He had some "loss" to the flow in his past: ad lib this</li></ul></li><li>They meet another party: Kazian, Anne, Hessia, evil Sahrit, Biji and Ericks Goldsmith.<ul><li>They nearly stopped the Ordering in Trimsaran. The killed two geomancers, and witnessed the third killed with a backlash of energy from the nexus.</li><li>Ericks Goldsmith, thoroughly crazy and worshipping a "forgotten god,"
babbles about how if things are allowed to continue, "a monster will be
set free and devour the world." He has an unknown holy symbol, and when asked who his god is, exclaims: "HE MUST NOT BE NAMED!"</li><li>Kazian: "That halfling we met on the way into town..."<ul><li>Biji: "Shut up, crazy lady was crazy."</li><li>Hessia: "She sounded awfully serious."</li><li>Glee came running up to them, looking ragged: "You were there too, weren't you? At Trimsaran? I can't believe he actually went through with it! He's even crazier than I realized... it's only a matter of time now, only a matter of time. Soon, all the nexuses... Get out while you can!" Runs off gibbering.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Glee Topun of the Guild (appears as female halfling merchant) was the one who made contact with Jonas, then known as Calanon.<ul><li>Kith senses Glee contains a Melora spark</li><li>Isaline, if using true seeing, will see Glee's formlessness</li><li>While visiting the Harion tribe, met Calanon, then leader of the tribe</li><li>Became friends, but learned of his insane plan</li><li>Calanon spoke of a time before nexuses, and his desire to return things to the way they used to be</li><li>Being somewhat of a druid herself, was interested and understood some portions of what he was saying, and was terrified</li><li>"I never thought he would go through with it"</li><li>Knows about possibility mining, but says absolutely nothing about it, as she wants the Guild to be the sole possessors of this knowledge</li></ul></li><li>Asmodeus also doesn't like the Ordering, and it has cramped her history revisioning from working. But she doesn't send anyone to help.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consequences of the Ordering</strong></span></p><ul><li>When Tat'enda was Ordered, the quakes there magnified.</li><li>These quakes encompassed a number of worlds.</li><li>All of those worlds have become subject to strange probabilistic effects: possibility mining.</li><li>Jonas is an ancient elf, currently in Tat'enda, in the eye, but he taps into the barrier using druidic magics that predate the nexuses.<ul><li>Was a young child when the nexuses first were created.</li><li>Doesn't know much if anything about the war of the gods.</li><li>Subscribed to the Fey philosophy for a few millennia, as leader of the Harion tribe</li><li>Got upset when the gnomes and eladrin broke from the fey, and vowed to do something about this "cataclysm"</li><li>Targeting only nexuses that are probablistically inverted</li><li>Jonas has observed that occasionally people fall away from the path of nature, and consequently develop a rapport with the inverted nexuses; as such, he has gained a unique understanding of nexuses, giving him insight into the Ordering ritual, which is designed to return things back to the Prime state, collapsing the worlds back together<ul><li>Three geomancers are needed to Order a nexus:<ol><li>Empower the nexus with spiritual energy</li><li>Force a quake</li><li>Collapse the nexus</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>If enough nexuses are Ordered (i.e., enough links in the chain are broken), throughout the material realm, Tharizdun is free by definition.</li></ul></li><li>This allowed the Brotherhood to "probabilistically" strike at three targets simultaneously, then strike at Heimdall later despite losses.</li></ul>      </div>
