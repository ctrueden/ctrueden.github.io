"You can tell they were made in a much colder climate due to the impurities, our guess is the forge in Niflheim."</li><li>At Niflheim: at first they deny it. "Yeah, we made that armor. We told Lady Dragontamer that it would be impure, but she insisted. And she swore us to secrecy—Lord Dragontamer's orders, matter of Imperial security, etc., etc. So don't go blamin' us."</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Characters:</p><ul><li>Biger – If we get bored, can have the kitsune cleric of Olidammara (now wearing a holy symbol of Garl Glittergold) show up and try to trick Biger; but Wrin may warn him: "Incompatible..."</li><li>Kith – The Guild may want to use Kith to kill clerics with the weapon, "randomly," to non-deterministically strike at the gods</li><li>Ed – Nothing specific (Max the Merchant remembers him, and knows Glee Topun...)</li><li>Simone – Probably will spend some time sharing stuff with the other PCs</li><li>Cameron – Knows about Jonas; the Guild wants to steer the party towards him, to take him out, without exposing themselves</li><li>Rebin – How was he rescued? Does he remember? Not yet...</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Glee Topun of the Guild (appears as female halfling merchant) was 
the one who made contact with Jonas, then known as Calanon.</p><ul><li>Cameron knows she is one of the other Guildmasters</li><li>Wants to feed the party information without seeming suspicious</li><li>Could go through Cameron, but might be hard to explain how Cameron has this knowledge</li><li>Let Cameron concoct a plan with Glee about how to tell the party these details</li><li>Kith 
senses Glee contains a Melora spark</li></ul><p>Glee's story:</p><ul><li>While visiting the Harion 
tribe, met Calanon, then leader of the tribe</li><li>Became friends, but
 learned of his insane plan</li><li>Calanon spoke of a time before 
nexuses, and his desire to return things to the way they used to be</li><li>Being
 somewhat of a druid herself, was interested and understood some 
portions of what he was saying, and was terrified</li><li>"I never 
thought he would go through with it"</li><li>Knows about possibility 
mining, but says absolutely nothing about it, as she wants the Guild to 
be the sole possessors of this knowledge</li><li>Guild wants to use possibility mining to replicate </li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Consequences of the Ordering</strong></span></p><ul><li>When
 Tat'enda was Ordered, the quakes there magnified.</li><li>These quakes 
encompassed a number of worlds.</li><li>All of those worlds have become 
subject to strange probabilistic effects: possibility mining.</li><li>This
 allowed the Brotherhood to "probabilistically" strike at three targets 
simultaneously, then strike at Heimdall later despite losses.</li><li>Jonas
 is an ancient elf, currently in Tat'enda, in the eye, but he taps into 
the barrier using druidic magics that predate the nexuses.<ul><li>Was a 
young child when the nexuses first were created.</li><li>Doesn't know 
much if anything about the war of the gods.</li><li>Subscribed to the 
Fey philosophy for a few millennia, as leader of the Harion tribe</li><li>Got
 upset when the gnomes and eladrin broke from the fey, and vowed to do 
something about this "cataclysm"</li><li>Targeting only nexuses that are
 probablistically inverted</li><li>Jonas has observed that occasionally 
people fall away from the path of nature, and consequently develop a 
rapport with the inverted nexuses; as such, he has gained a unique 
understanding of nexuses, giving him insight into the Ordering ritual, 
which is designed to return things back to the Prime state, collapsing 
the worlds back together<ul><li>Three geomancers are needed to Order a 
nexus:<ol><li>Empower the nexus with spiritual energy</li><li>Force a 
quake</li><li>Collapse the nexus</li></ol></li></ul></li><li>If enough 
nexuses are Ordered (i.e., enough links in the chain are broken), 
throughout the material realm, Tharizdun is free by definition.</li><li>Previously was loyal to Obad-Hai's philosophy, but Obad-Hai has been absent: "Obad-Hai is dead!"</li></ul></li><li>Wee Jas is now guiding Jonas:<ul><li>She has told him: the Ordering will reunite the world. One past, one future. No more withered, no more withering.</li><li>Wee Jas wants to start again, after Tharizdun is released and creation is undone, but Jonas doesn't know that.</li><li>She has temples, and worshippers, but never grants spells to them (as far as anyone knows).</li><li>Bardic knowledge:<ul><li>Sometimes people try to shut down the temples, but when that happens those responsible suffer horrible misfortune which always ends in death (30+: every single one of those people have died in very unlikely ways—and the flow doesn't return them).</li><li>A deva once wanted to end his "suffering" by terminating his rebirth cycle. He sacrificed himself on the altar in a temple of Wee Jas, and his corpse remained (usually it disappears).</li><li>There are warlocks who claim to have made a pact with Wee Jas for their power rather than a devil, though this is extremely rare. In actuality, the master warlock of Tane'klenya forged his pact with Wee Jas.</li></ul></li><li>x</li></ul></li></ul>      </div>
