The Ordering</p><p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-bottom: 0.8em;"><strong>Migration:</strong></p><ul><li>REMAIN
 – Cameron, Ed, Kith</li><li>PLUS
 – Dariel, Za'har</li><li>MINUS – Biger, Simone, Rebin</li></ul><p><strong>Location:</strong> Alexandria, about to travel to Mordollwen swamp</p><p>See <a href="/eidolons/gm/f14">F-14</a> for previous details, including Jonas's history and attitudes.</p><p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Character-specific arcs<br /></strong></span></p><ul><li><strong>Cameron:</strong> "If left unchecked, your greatest weapon will be your undoing."</li><li><strong>Dariel:</strong> From the same tribe as Calanon. His band 
made it to Intempestivus, and saw that it had been Ordered. So for some 
reason relating to that, he is getting involved, seeking to stop Calanon
 from further desecration of nature. Doesn't 
know Jonas is in Tat'enda. "The lady in black possesses what you seek."</li><li><strong>Ed:</strong> "If the experiment fails, it will mean ruin for friend and foe alike."</li><li><strong>Kith:</strong> Wants to save Araris. "Beware the duplicity of Aameul and Hethradiah." Also, if the Sword is mentioned, Mordollwen states that it is now where it needs to be.</li><li><strong>Rebin:</strong> Wants to save his father. Can trade Vance to Levistus for Moradin. "Guard your father's spirit well, for the lich will seek to steal your family's power."</li><li><strong>Za'har:</strong> "If you wish to reconcile your nature, ask your mentor about Rices and Shaell."</li></ul><p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conflict in the swamp</strong></span></p><p>When the party nears Mordollwen's palace, they find the doors sealed shut, barring entry. No one appears to be home. But they hear the sounds of a conflict in the distance, toward the nearest nexus, which is the one Sahrit originally inverted last year. Ed can verify this using his map.</p><p>If they try to enter the palace while she's away, they must face an endless number of unseen servants, who will wear them down. If they steal anything, Mordollwen can divine its location due to her mark upon the item, even when protected by nondetection. </p><p>Jonas is getting better at "possibilizing" people. They have begun the Ordering ritual here, and Mordollwen is trying to fight them off, but the enemies land blow after lucky blow upon her.</p><p>There are a dozen mooks (level 5 fighters) and those same three geomancers (level 13) from before. The fighters are mobbing Mordollwen, and roll 20s for every d20 roll, which allows them to crit every time with their brilliant energy weapons. They also dodge her breath attack every time due to their rings of evasion.</p><p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Mordollwen's attitude<br /></strong></span></p><ul><li>She knew the party would save her, so isn't initially very grateful</li><li>She's petulant about not ever encountering the Orb.</li><li>She secretly made a deal with Vance:<ul><li>She told Vance something he wanted to know; TODO - what is it? What is 
their long-term relationship?</li><li>In exchange, Vance agreed to turn over evil Sahrit to her after 
removing his Mark</li><li>Vance wanted the Sword, but Mordollwen had already given it away</li><li>Mordollwen was disappointed that Vance couldn't/wouldn't invert 
nexuses for her, or teach her how</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>In return for helping her, Mordollwen tells them their best chance to defeat Vance:</p><ol><li>Complete Sahrit's weapon</li><li>Leverage Jonas's power:<ul><li>To do that, Jonas must remain among the living</li><li>If they kick his 
ass, he will relent on the Ordering, and aid them in attacking 
Vance by "possibilizing" them</li><li>But in exchange, he wants to live out the rest of his days outside the
 flow, in Tat'enda</li><li>He also wants their Oath on Wee Jas that they will do everything in their power to prevent the Calamity</li></ul></li></ol><p>If they offer something to her, she will tell them how to find Jonas:</p><ul><li>Seek someone with a connection to Jonas—ideally someone who Jonas trusts and respects (i.e., Dariel)</li><li>"This person must be brought here, so that we can use him"</li><li>But Dariel is already there—he was seeking her scrying pool artifact, and ran into Jonas's goons</li><li>Mordollwen can use this person to fuel her scrying pool (actually a wall of hematite beneath her palace, part of a banded iron formation, polished to a reflective sheen)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Battle with Jonas in Tat'enda</strong></span></p><p>TODO POSSIBLE - encounter at Tat'enda with Jonas - but probably better to cliffhanger</p>      </div>
