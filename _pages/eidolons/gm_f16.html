They are Isaline's parents. So far, they are the only two enlightened humans who have ever existed.</p><p>The rakshasa Shaell is also one of Simone's ancestors (great grandfather?), explaining many of her strange abilities.</p><p>The deva and the rakshasa formed an adventuring party with two dragonborn swordsages (one Heaven &amp; one Hell fist practitioner), known as Arrek and Egorin, who learned their styles as they adventured with them, and were witnesses to their enlightenment. Other members of that adventuring party were two elves: Myl os Val and her lover, Calanon the ranger (alternate version from Jonas). This group also occasionally traveled with another deva, Corvidae.</p><p>When they died, they returned to the shadai kai village. The Raven Queen combined their souls, creating a witchalok, reborn as Joe -- the first true avatar of Tharizdun since his imprisonment. His memory is messed up partially to protect him from the gods finding out.</p><p>Jennifer was Rices's soul in the village. Anne's soul is currently in the Raven Queen's possession, a rare exception to Wee Jas's influence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>St. Cuthbert</p><p>Kas talks to Arwel </p>      </div>
