Bahamut's will imparted to Peacekeeper, to collapse all the nexuses, is in response to a vision of a world without nexuses (and because the inverted nexuses empower Tiamat). But he knew that a better way would emerge, though exactly what he was uncertain. Peacekeepr was told to be watchful of this better way, so when the party mentions the nexus in balance, Peacekeeper is eager to help.</p>      </div>
