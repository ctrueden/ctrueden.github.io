        <p>-Visit to Paimon, Vance and 'the kids'.<br />-Area enchanted to be un-scryable, has Mirage Arcana effect over the area to cause it to look entirely normal and uninteresting; like salt flats.<br />-Map causes the area to be findable, because the map is perfect.<br />-Vance tries to convince them to trade Moradin for Boccob, not him.<br />&nbsp; -Will open a portal to Prime.<br />-Alternately, kill Levistus and put him in the ice instead to get Moradin.<br />-He would explain that his plan involves the ability to replace the destroyed nexuses in order to restore 'order' in the Empire after Moradin and Bahamut are free and, he presumes, not granting their energy to the Empire anymore.<br />-"Babies will be sacrificed for the good of the world."<br />-Vance would explain that Boccob is the greater evil, and that he wishes to go to Prime, but could not contend with him without assistance.&nbsp; He asserts that Boccob does not have the greater health of the world in mind, but has instead been abusing his power and control for ignorant, selfish ends.&nbsp; Vance claims that he has gained a great deal of empathy for the people of the world by being forced to live among them; he is therefore the obvious choice to reclaim that power so that it can be properly used.<br />-Needs to open portal at Sigil, because his chain link was stolen at the same time as most of his other powers.</p>      </div>
