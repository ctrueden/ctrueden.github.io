        <p>Blue: Allen, Andy, Joel, Jeff, Paul<br />
&nbsp; - currently at sigil in true celestia, with Melora and Mammon, about 
to go to prime<br />
&nbsp; - meet the raven queen and wee jas at sigil<br />
&nbsp; - wee jas: "assassin who became a grandmother"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- very down to earth about many things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- their turn to choose what will be the future<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- answers questions to educate them, neutrally<br />
<br />
Red: Alex, Jesse, John, Moe, Nate<br />
&nbsp; - currently in level 5 hell, with moradin<br />
&nbsp; - moradin has had a change of heart: "he's been imprisoned long 
enough"<br />
&nbsp; - try to steer the party back to prime, to talk with wee jas &amp; the
 raven queen more<br />
&nbsp; - moradin still has his link, can transport them back via plane shift<br />
<br />
Once groups are unified, the task of undoing the ordering is discussed<br />
&nbsp; - Wee Jas points out that the ordering points are snarls in the chain<br />
&nbsp; - Paimon (and the Bone Mage and the Golem Mage?) is willing to give up
 the babies for use in curing the ordering<br />
&nbsp; - About the babies, Wee Jas says, "Sometimes death is necessary to 
create life"<br />
&nbsp; - At Tat'enda, Calanon doesn't want the ordering fixed, because he 
doesn't want to reenter the flow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - He reincarnated the dead nomads, so they look different, but are 
still there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - They can offer to take Calanon to Prime, outside the flow, and he 
will accept<br />
&nbsp; - Simultaneous strikes on Dispater and Bel will make it more difficult
 for them to warn each other...<br />
<br />
Intempestivus / Dis:<br />
&nbsp; - Asmodeus is there, recovering<br />
&nbsp; - Dispater protects the nexus, because it is healing Asmodeus<br />
&nbsp; - He is willing to entertain ideas of balancing the nexus, to better 
heal her<br />
&nbsp; - Cameron and Rebin are there as greater devils: Rebin is to replace 
Levistus as Geryon, Cameron is now known as Moloch<br />
<br />
Trimsaran / Avernus:<br />
&nbsp; - Avernus is the first layer of hell, created when Asmodeus first 
cursed the temple<br />
&nbsp; - Bronze Citadel, looks like a shorter version of Sigil, made of 
bronze<br />
&nbsp; - Bel is a pit fiend vampire, who feeds on the avatar of the lady of 
pain for his power<br />
&nbsp; - Inside the Bronze Citadel lies a dark (now ordered) nexus that leads
 to the Abyss<br />
&nbsp; - If they sneak in, they overhear Bel: "Two of their most powerful 
leaders have been slain. They are weak, and now is the time to strike! 
Asmodeus can no longer stay our hand! We cannot allow pathetic humans to
 steal any more of our honor. To battle! We shall destroy the infinite 
layers of the Abyss and leave nothing but devastation in our wake!"<br />
&nbsp; - Bel, eight black-armored pit fiends (the Dark 8) and thousands of 
other devil troops enter the nexus, leaving no one behind to guard it.<br />
&nbsp; - The party can then unorder the nexus...<br />
&nbsp; - The world ripples, the hells are forced out of the area, and things 
return to normal...</p>      </div>
