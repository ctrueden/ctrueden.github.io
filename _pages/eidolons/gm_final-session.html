"It has been made very clear that my place is no longer with you."</p><p>Pelor: Meeting has been called to order to discuss the actions of the mortals present—specifically their intent to undo the result of the gods' unified action. Moreover, several among the council present have aided them in this regard, indicating that some may have had a change of heart regarding our original decision. Therefore, our primary motivation for today's proceedings is to determine whether or not wrongdoing has taken place, and how to proceed with matters henceforth.</p><ul><li>Pelor suggests, and the gods agree, that the Lady of Pain will enforce the decisions of the day, to avoid another War of the Gods. He requests that she voluntarily agree to enforce the edict.<ul><li>Hextor: We hold dominion over her; there should be no need to <em>compromise</em> on this matter.</li><li>Pelor shuts him down; mentions that the Lady of Pain is more autonomous than previously believed.</li><li>Lady of Pain transforms into the Raven Queen, agrees to Pelor's request, in exchange for a seat on the council.</li></ul></li><li>PCs are given the opportunity to testify regarding the rationale for their actions.</li><li>Explain who has aided them and why.</li><li>Not a witch trial—goal is to evaluate the situation, rather than necessarily punish anyone (though punishment may perhaps be the final outcome).</li><li>PCs can take turns making statements (interruptions are fine, but one person at a time "has the floor").</li><li>The council is charged with listening without interruption, unless asked for input by whoever is testifying.</li></ul><p>Corellon: I sense the presence of the All-Father on several of those present. Does that not concern anyone else?<br />Vecna: *wryly* Perhaps we should simply throw them into the prison with Tharizdun...</p><p>Joesph—Suspicious: link to Tharizdun<br />Za'har—Suspicious: link to Tharizdun<br />Sahrit—Suspicious: link to Tharizdun</p><p> Isaline—Suspicious: service to Raven Queen<br />Admatha—Suspicious: service to Nerull<br />Arwel—Suspicious: service to Cuthbert</p><p> Biger—Suspicious: back door to Tharizdun's prison</p><p> Vashir—Suspicious: rakshasa have been shown to be linked to humans<br />Ed—Suspicious: in his mind is a direct link to Tharizdun's prison<br />Simone—Suspicious: practitioner of the forbidden art of chronomancy<br />Kith—Suspicious: done harm to the gods themselves</p><p>Dariel—</p><ul><li>Pelor: You are... completely innocent of any wrongdoing, save for assisting in the attempt to open the prison. Well done.</li><li>Yondolla: That is a <em>grievous </em>sin. How dare you congratulate him?</li><li>Pelor: That has yet to be decided.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Vote<br /></strong></span></p><p>Ultimately, the conversation moves toward the fact that the gods need to decide whether Tharizdun should ultimately be released. Hence, a vote is called. Pelor asks each voter to keep their statement very brief.</p><p>Avandra: What of mortalkind? Do they not get a say in this?<br />Pelor: It was through our actions that the prison was made; we bear the responsibility of choosing whether to unmake it.</p><p>NAY - Pelor</p><ul><li>My position is no secret.</li><li>The prison cannot be opened.</li></ul><p>NAY - Corellon</p><ul><li>&nbsp;I agree; Tharizdun would have been our undoing, if he had not been contained.</li></ul><p> YEA - Moradin</p><ul><li>Pelor: It is a pleasure to see you again; it is good that you have finally been freed of your prison.</li><li>Moradin: It's time to let him go. No one deserves that fate.</li></ul><p> NAY - Yondalla</p><ul><li>My people were decimated during the war. The humans caused us untold pain and suffering. I vote to keep the prison closed.</li></ul><p> YEA - Garl Glittergold</p><ul><li>It was a mistake to create the prison to begin with.</li><li>I've never been fully behind it, but in particular, recent events indicate that releasing the Chained God may not be as catastrophic as we thought.</li><li>I therefore vote to open the prison.</li></ul><p> YEA - Obad-Hai</p><ul><li>Opening the prison is the path to returning the world to balance. I vote Yea.</li></ul><p> NAY - Sehanine</p><ul><li>My husband is wrong about many things, but not this. The prison should stay closed.</li></ul><p> NAY - Gruumsh</p><ul><li>The All-Father will kill all of us if we release him. The prison should stay closed.</li><li>(Erythnul starts muttering to himself.)</li></ul><p> YEA - Io</p><ul><li>My enlightened perspective has allowed me to understand the cruelty and madness that we the gods have inflicted on Tharizdun.</li><li>It is time to end it.</li></ul><p> NAY - Bane</p><ul><li>We risked everything to get where we are now.</li><li>Opening the prison would be throwing it all away, for nothing.</li><li>Let the prison stay closed.</li></ul><p> YEA - Ioun</p><ul><li>The prison will open.</li><li>Pelor: We will see...</li></ul><p> NAY - Erythnul</p><ul><li>Are you mad? This is foolishness.</li><li>NAY—it is as Gruumsh said: he would kill us all...</li></ul><p> YEA - Melora</p><ul><li>You all know how I stand on this matter.</li><li>What has been done is the greatest atrocity ever committed in our history... and it must end.</li></ul><p> NAY - Kord</p><ul><li>Sorry, but I'm with the big P on this one.</li><li>Pelor: Don't ever call me that.</li></ul><p>NAY - Hextor</p><ul><li>I enjoy existence too much to let it end now. Nay.</li></ul><p>ABSTAIN - Fharlanghn</p><ul><li>I respectfully abstain from these proceedings. Do as you will.</li></ul><p>YEA - Vecna</p><ul><li>Vecna: It seems to me that since I possess two deific mantles, I should have two votes!</li><li>Olidammara: We agree completely! This only makes sense.</li><li>Garl: Two links for two votes, eh? Sounds fair enough. I agree as well.</li><li>Pelor: I do NOT. The gods of chaos are not in order! You will receive ONE vote—decide carefully.</li></ul><p>BOTH - Olidammara</p><ul><li>four masks: laughing, crying, passive, faceless</li><li>(argues with himself)</li><li>Pelor: Silence, you fools. Decide quickly.</li><li>(all of them change their minds)</li><li>Pelor: Very well, I will take that as an abstention.</li></ul><p>YEA - Raven Queen</p><ul><li>There is no other option but to undo this gross transgression at your collective hands.</li></ul><p>YEA - Wee Jas</p><ul><li>Pelor: Your position in this matter is well known, but as a formality, please state your position.</li><li>Wee Jas: This choice is one that affects all. I will respect the desire of mortalkind to see the prison opened.</li></ul><p>Pelor: The gods have spoken. As the vote stands, there is no decision. Hence, I propose that no action be taken, as there is no clear majority.</p><p>YEA - Erythnul</p><ul><li>WAIT!</li><li>It would be glorious...</li><li>He would kill us ALL...</li><li>Open the prison!</li><li>Pelor: You have already cast your vote!</li><li>Erythnul: I am recasting it. Do you have a problem with that? *draws twin morningstars dripping with various substances*</li></ul><p>Conclusion</p><ul><li>Pelor: *sigh* Does anyone ELSE wish to change your vote? This is your LAST CHANCE.</li><li>Olidammaras open their mouths, and Pelor silences them: OTHER THAN OLIDAMMARA.</li><li>*long silence*</li><li>Pelor: *weary* Very well. The vote is ten in favor, eight against. So be it. May the All-Father have mercy on all of us.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3.
