        <p>In-universe names for the phenomena:</p>
<ul id="xeu90">
    <li>&quot;flow&quot; -- What the nomads call the <a href="/eidolons/setting/flow">mercurial cosmos</a>. The technoprophets call it &quot;entropy,&quot;&nbsp;whereas the Durus Empire calls it &quot;the blight.&quot;</li>
    <li id="w1rf58">&quot;quake&quot; -- The basic kind clones the world (&quot;fissions&quot; it) into two &quot;impressions.&quot; There is a tether now connecting both impressions, which are very similar, but not identical, according to a Gaussian probability distribution. Disappearing things from one of the impressions are transported to the other (so they switch places, which is why it is rare for someone to be &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;returned,&quot; because usually another version of the person immediately replaces the original). The term &quot;quake&quot;&nbsp;is used by many people, and notably the technoprophets. The Durus Empire calls them &quot;disturbances,&quot;&nbsp;while the nomads call them &quot;surges.&quot;</li>
    <li id="w1rf59">&quot;intense quake&quot; -- A slightly more complicated kind (&quot;higher on the Richter scale&quot;), which happens less often, is a fission into more than two copies. Then all the fissioned impressions are connected, and each lost thing from each impression goes to a random connected world -- a much more chaotic quake.</li>
    <li id="w1rf60">&quot;steady quake&quot; -- They are very mild, but occasionally have very profound effects on the world, because they connect two or more established impressions. You still often (but less often than basic) can get the swapping effect, but also often there will be lost and returned things as well.</li>
    <li id="w1rf61">&quot;vertigo&quot; -- You feel something pulling at your soul, and feel disoriented, though the earth does not actually shake, and the world shifts around you&nbsp;(you swap with an eidolon across a tether). Vertigo happens to individuals and sometimes groups, rather than the entire world, making it a much less severe, but also much more common, experience than quakes.</li>
    <li id="xeu9">&quot;collapse&quot; -- Sometimes tethers break. Still need to decide how such a break manifests itself spatially. Is there a quake? Maybe the world feels like peeing on an electric fence for a moment. Maybe collapse happens when an impression becomes too interconnected; maybe only a certain number of tethers can be sustained simultaneously. Or maybe an impression with too many tethers can itself collapse? Maybe collapsing impressions is a villain's goal.</li>
</ul>
<ul id="xeu90">
    <li>&quot;impressions&quot; -- worlds/planes of existence</li>
    <li id="w1rf38">&quot;shift&quot; or &quot;mutate&quot; -- the act of someone changing due to a tremor, or the world changing around you</li>
    <li id="w1rf41">&quot;one of the returned&quot; -- another version of a previously dead person coming back</li>
    <li id="w1rf42">&quot;one of the lost&quot; -- a person going away without another version showing up</li>
    <li id="w1rf43">&quot;eidolons&quot;&nbsp;or &quot;obverse twins&quot;&nbsp;-- multiple versions of the same person</li>
    <li id="w1rf45">&quot;skew&quot; -- when a change between worlds/planes results in a difference in someone's memory</li>
    <li id="xeu91">&quot;dissonance&quot; -- when the skew is severe enough to cause interpersonal tension or conflict</li>
    <li id="xeu91">&quot;tether&quot; -- a connection between impressions</li>
</ul>
