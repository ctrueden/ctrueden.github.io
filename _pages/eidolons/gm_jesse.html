        <p>Isaline was responsible for saving infant Gustav&mdash;only in her reality did the Duke of Blackdale fail to kill the child and take power over Elyria over the next years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Corvidae<br /></strong></u></p><p>In Isaline's reality, Corvidae uncovered evidence of the duke's involvement with Frederick's death, so the duke silenced the venerable cleric as well. But when Corvidae died, the Raven Queen recalled him to the Plane of Shadow, specifically to Joseph's village. This was five years ago, so Joseph would be aware of this young deva (he disappeared from the village 4 years ago).</p><p>For the past 5 years, Isaline's Corvidae has been living in the Shadar Kai village. While there, he learned much of the world from Jennifer, Cuthbert's avatar there. His Sending was sent to Isaline from there.</p><p>He also sent a raven to deliver a message to her while she is on the Path of Shadow. This message is not intercepted by Vecna, because the Plane of Shadow is the Raven Queen's domain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Soren van Wagram<br /></strong></u></p><p>The Duke of Blackdale is a vampire, and high-ranking member of the necromantic cult led by Vance, who has instructed him to arrange for Isaline's destruction (even though most versions of him don't know who she is).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Council of War<br /></strong></u></p><p>Isaline was invited to a &quot;council of war,&quot;&nbsp;convened immediately upon the Emperor's death, to decide how to react (~150 total involved people). But the mass Sending did not reach her, because she was time skewed at the time. She is currently presumed dead by most within the Empire.</p>      </div>
