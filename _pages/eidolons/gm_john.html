        <p><em>GM discussion of John's character to go here.</em>&nbsp;</p>  <p>One basic idea with warforged is that they usually stick to doing what they were made to do. They may be really smart, but still they have a &quot;nature.&quot; Ed's nature is to be adaptive, which was something that had been tried before, but not met with this level of success. Why not?</p><p>Ed was forged by Moradin a long time ago. Garl is insanely jealous of the design, but has not been able to replicate it.</p><p></p><p>Theta, trained as a ninja, gets infected, because warforged are not immune to the plague. Hence, Theta becomes a robot ninja zombie.</p><div>&nbsp;</div>      </div>
