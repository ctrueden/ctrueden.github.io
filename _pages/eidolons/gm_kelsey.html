        <p>Haroun's nexus was created by essentially implanting a nexus heart into Haroun as an infant or young child.</p><p>This process is how Vance&nbsp;(Sahrit's father)&nbsp;found out about nexus hearts&mdash;he and Paimon were on the team that created Haroun.</p><p>Vance and Paimon need Haroun to be present at the place of power for some reason. They need a mobile nexus&mdash;of which Haroun is one of a kind.</p><p>Any prophecy that Haroun gets is something that Vance immediately knows. Haroun is one of two prophets who receives unique prophecies (the other being Iraja). But Haroun is positively attuned, while&nbsp;Iraja has exposure to inverted nexuses.</p><p>Iraja's prophecies show the world in terms of what it could be, in the worst possible way.&nbsp;Calamities and catastrophies.</p><p>Haroun's prophecies show the world in terms of all possible futures&mdash;what is most likely to occur, other things that could potentially happen, and things that could go wrong.</p><p>Haroun gets&nbsp;quantum-mechanical flashes of could be happening. E.g., if he sees a bounty hunter in the street, he could see a flash of the bounty hunter attacking and subduing him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
