        <p>Lucas's character is one of Olidammara's copies who joined the Guild of the Invisible Hand. The process acted strangely on someone with divine essence, and the subsequent reaction converted him into a being of total formlessness. He soon forgot his past. Left with only the impulse to reproduce, he has proliferated himself into a totally new race of beings.</p> <p>Does the Guild know of Kumo and the other kitsune? We have indicated no, since Jason doesn't know what he is. But&nbsp;he could find out&mdash;the five Guildmasters certainly remember the Incident of the Failed Joining or whatnot&mdash;just haven't connected it to Kumo yet.</p>      </div>
