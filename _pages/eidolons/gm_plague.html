        <div>The first Emperor, in one world, oversaw the Empire's successful spread across the greater portion of the known world. The Wilds were penetrated, nexuses were collapsed, and ultimately the temple was brought down.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Asmodeus revealed himself to the people, declaring that they must pledge their allegiance, but the Emperor, betrayed, mustered his people's undying honor and refused. For you see, he possessed one of the rarest items in all the planes: an orb of Dragonkind.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Asmodeus sent a devil force to crush this rebellion of sorts, but the Emperor fought back with Bahamut on his side. Ultimately, though many were slain, some lived until they withered to death, at which point Asmodeus got what she wanted anyway: the world, the Orb... a new Hell.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The Emperor, once withered, became twisted after Asmodeus gained control of the Orb of Dragonkind. Tiamat and Asmodeus curse the Emperor's form, and he becomes the slug Baalzebul.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Baalzebul and his ilk from the 7th hell are the source of a terrible plague. Asmodeus has kept it carefully contained on that world, until now. Due to recent events, she has decided that perhaps more extreme measures are necessary, and has unleashed a small number of the plague zombies in a handful of key worlds, with the idea that the flow will duplicate these worlds ripe for her taking, and spread the plague in so doing.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Infection: undead natural attacks; death explosion (see plague zombie entry in PF bestiary); also plague is carried by flies associated with the undead. These flies enjoy dead things as usual, but like to bite mortals for their blood. These bites spread the disease.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Asmodeus first unleashes the zombie outbreak at:</div><ul><li>Tat'enda</li><li>The Imperial city where the 2nd Ordering happened</li><li>Arx, Terminas, or both</li><li>The Oni renegade warlock knows the truth behind the zombies</li></ul><div>&nbsp;The orc refugees from Arx settle at the ruins of the destroyed Arx outpost, and begin to rebuild there, with Admatha's assistance. But the zombies soon strike there as well!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
