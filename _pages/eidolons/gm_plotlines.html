explanation:&nbsp;in Haroun's reality, she never met Vance, and thus stayed
on as an overseer of Haroun's growth. In Sahrit's reality, though, she
left the nexus implantation experiment to return home to Fochlucan with
Vance as her new husband. She was innocent of Vance's treachery... he
met her when he got involved with the nexus implantation experiments,
and then used her to meet the Fochlucan tribe. When she caught wind of
his plan, he waited until she had his child, and then murdered her.x</li></ul></li><li>Evil Sahrit: What is to become of him?
