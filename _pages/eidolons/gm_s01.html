</strong></span></p>
<p>~1 yr: Fochlucan incident (nexus inverts)</p>
<p>~1 yr: Shortly after, Iraja has a vision of the inverted Fochlucan nexus collapsing due to a ritual performed by nomadic people<br />
- She travels to stop it, hopefully?<br />
<br />
~11 months: Iraja gets there; ritual commences.<br />
- Critical event: 50/50 whether she succeeds in stopping it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prequil Events<br />
</strong></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> </strong></span><strong>Iraja</strong> has a prophetic vision of the Fochlucan nexus collapsing due to a botched attempt to cleanse it.</li>
    <li><strong>Naxk</strong> and <strong>Simone</strong> escape from goblin tribe together, and flee in a direction Naxk is told (by his patron) will lead to his salvation.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, Iraja meets <strong>Kumo</strong> and recognizes him from her vision. He follows her like a lost puppy. They proceed to the Fochlucan nexus, where Iraja arrives in time to discuss the ritual with those present (but after Sahrin has already left -- the corrupting event has already occurred).</li>
    <li>Naxk and Simone arrive at the nexus during the ritual. Naxk and Simone can both feel that the energy is different, and it refreshes them both just fine. [If they interrupt the ritual, that could be what triggers the collapse. If they just watch, Iraja has a prophetic vision from the dark nexus about the cataclysm, in which case maybe Kumo is somehow responsible for the collapse?]</li>
    <li>Nexus collapses into a hole in the ground, sucking people in, including Iraja, Naxk, Simone and Kumo.</li>
    <li>When they awaken, they find <strong>Admatha</strong> trapped in a cave-in, and assume it was the same one&nbsp;(though it actually wasn't—see below). They free her, and she takes them to Tane’klenya, her city.
    <ul>
        <li>Admatha had gone to investigate the spontaneously inverted nexus on Councilor Zo'sha's direct orders.</li>
        <li>The nexus's instability caused a tunnel collapse at an awkward time, killing her companions and trapping her close enough to the nexus that she could not die of her wounds.</li>
        <li>She is stuck there, next to an inverted nexus, constantly healing her, so she doesn't die, but can't get free.</li>
        <li>After a week, in a haze of pain and desperation, she makes a deal with Nerull for power.</li>
        <li>She instantly withers and becomes a bhut—but with a new earth vulnerability, she is still trapped!</li>
        <li>After another ~2 weeks, the nexus collapses, and the others find her still trapped there.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Tane'klenya is also <strong>Vashir</strong>'s family's home city in the Underdark, and where he returns once <span style="color: #003300;">Manavendra</span><span>&nbsp;(Durus city where he and Za'hran are from) is destroyed.<br />
    </span></li>
    <li><strong><span>Cameron</span></strong><span> is masquerading as a tiefling official, having secured a seat of power in Tane'klenya. He is acting</span> magistrate&nbsp;(believed by most to be in <span>Matron Sh'chepan</span>'s pocket), speaking on matters of law. Admatha brings her newfound companions before him, and he is very interested:
    <ul>
        <li>Cameron learns that Iraja somehow had unique knowledge of the nexus collapse before it occurred—he recognizes her as a powerful prophet and keeps her around, treating her fairly but not allowing her to leave the city.&nbsp;The Guild knows it is only a matter of time before she reveals more truths about the coming times of trial.</li>
        <li>Naxk is identified as a servant of Asmodeus, and escorted to the warlock palace. The head warlock welcomes him into the fold, and it is explained to him that the warlocks serve the city—as they see fit, and in exchange for many rewards&nbsp;(gesture at palace and slave girls). Naxk is put to work cleaning tunnels with his newfound destructive abilities, and at night enjoys the pleasures of the palace.</li>
        <li>Simone is recognized as prime Guild material. Cameron instantly likes her, and can tell there is something special about her. She almost feels like one of his people... perhaps there is some changeling in her heritage?&nbsp;He decides to test her, sending her on a few errands around the city. Once she accomplishes those, Cameron inducts her into the Guild, giving her a ring and explaining that there are more important things at stake than petty politics. Once Iraja has her vision of the Emperor performing the ritual at the place of power&nbsp;(see below), Simone is tasked with finding that place, and told she will gain status within the Guild if she succeeds in her task. [This is how Simone ends up with the Blue group.]</li>
        <li>Kumo makes Cameron feel afraid—he feels strangely similar to the Brethren in some ways, but is definitely <em>not</em> one of them. Cameron can tell with absolute certainty that in fact Kumo could <em>never</em> become one of them. The Guild is curious about his nature, but all the doppelgangers share the same fear when in his proximity.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>After a few months, Iraja experiences another prophecy; Cameron conveys it to the Guild and they order him to act on it, and to personally build a team to check it out, putting his political situation in Tane'klenya on hold for the time being.<br />
    <ul>
        <li>The vision is of a dragonborn man in jewel-encrusted armor (one set into each arm and each leg, and another in the breastplate)<br />
        <ul>
            <li>interpretation: jewels signify the regions of the Empire</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The man stands next to an altar, in a massive chamber of detailed stonework, with a starry sky above, many thousands of points of light
        <ul>
            <li>interpretation:&nbsp;the stars represent spiritual energy, with the chamber itself indicating some kind of focal point for it, the likes of which she has never seen or even imagined</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Man is wielding a greatsword, slays a vibrant-looking dryad lying on an altar<br />
        <ul>
            <li>interpretation: dryad represents the natural world</li>
            <li>interpretation: sword is not a symbol, but a powerful artifact of some sort, key to everything</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The dryad dies, and the man looks relieved and even triumphant. But then the dryad's flesh withers, and she rises again.<br />
        <ul>
            <li>interpretation: the world is ruined somehow by this act (if REALLY well: the world is transformed to a dead place)</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The man looks upon her with horror and regret, as she turns to devour him<br />
        <ul>
            <li>interpretation: the Empire is humbled and subsequently destroyed by this turn of events</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>More straightforward [obsolete] version:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>Iraja's vision is of the current Emperor of the Durus Empire completing a ritual in some massive chamber, with ley lines flowing to it. Iraja realizes this temple itself is the largest most massive nexus she has ever seen; she does not know of any such place in reality.</li>
        <li>As the ritual completes, the ley lines tear from the ground, and fold into the center of the chamber; the structure shakes and begins to collapse, and a dark force washes over the world, laughing maniacally as people fall dead in droves and rise as withered</li>
        <li>With high enough geomancy roll, Iraja knows beyond a shadow of a doubt:&nbsp;nexuses are all destroyed, and  overarching evil power controls everything as a result.</li>
        <li>Guild's plan is to stop this by killing the man responsible for the ritual in the first place:&nbsp;the Emperor.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Timing is good, for they have just learned of a weapon that may be able to harm Bahamut himself, when used to slay the Emperor: the Sword of Kas&nbsp;(though they don't know it is called that). <em>[Open question:&nbsp;how did they learn of this?&nbsp;How do they know it is going to be in that lineship?]</em></li>
    <li>Also, finding the place in Iraja's vision is paramount... Cameron sends Simone, and the Guild recruits others as well to investigate.</li>
    <li>Cameron brings on <strong>Vashir</strong> (who knows the Empire)&nbsp;and <strong>Naxk</strong> as hired muscle to attack a caravan&nbsp;(a lineship) carrying the weapon. He brings <strong>Admatha</strong> and <strong>Iraja</strong> as well; and <strong>Kumo</strong> won't be left behind. They are all to coordinate with one of the hordes.</li>
    <li><em>[Next session:&nbsp;Hooray for mass combat!&nbsp;The Dark group wins out against the Red group, because Isaline, the human, wasn't there to contribute her strength!]<br />
    </em></li>
    <li>Once they obtain the weapon, Cameron secretly gives it to Kithlandil, tasking him with killing the Emperor, and leaving the sword impaled in his chest at the scene.&nbsp;He does this so that divination magics will have a harder time tracing it back to him.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>Andy was wondering: why can Simone refresh at both inverted and normal nexuses?</p>
<p>Mechanical implications depending which one she last refreshed at.<br />
(Maybe for anyone: refreshing at a normal nexus gives bless to you for next 24 hours; inverted nexus does something different.)</p>      </div>
