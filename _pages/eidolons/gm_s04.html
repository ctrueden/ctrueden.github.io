        <p>When Cameron touches the sword, there is a quake. He switches with Za'har, finding himself in Eloyes.</p><p>After Cameron delivers the Sword, and reports to the Guild, he is instructed to continue efforts toward finding this mysterious "place of power." Some prophecy about meeting in Terminus.</p><hr /><p>Za'har wants to avert the Emperor's death -- tells the Saturday group of this.<br />&nbsp;- Vashir and Za'har have a history... explore?<br />&nbsp;- Admatha hears from Nerull -- go with them and <br /><br />some dragonborn start getting sick<br />--empire goes to war (once they start blaming delphia)</p><hr /><p>1) Sophia Fochlucan-Doubain, visiting Arx, asks Iraja and Kumo to come to Arx to meet with the Delphia researchers. Sophia mentions concerns about Delphia's obsessive interest in the event, and wishes for another voice to caution them against this dark energy.<br />&nbsp;- Cameron's superior (and by extension Silius Vartarra) asks him personally to attend this Arx meeting.<br />&nbsp;- Admatha given a sign from Nerull that Delphia experimenting with dark energy = "good"! Make it clear her getting involved in this process to sway it in the right direction is encouraged.<br />&nbsp;- Naxk would like to see more dark nexuses -- having a balance between light and dark, with the teleportation circles, makes Delphia a tempting place to live.<br /><br />Was at least one "spy" for Delphia at the Fochlucan (and one "spy" for the Empire -- the Dragonborn geomancer). This spy collected some of the dark nexus energy as "samples" in special jars -- a technique known to the technoprophets. She brought it back to Arx, where they have been studying it. But they want to talk to others who were present at the ritual -- especially Kumo and Iraja. Kumo because he did that crazy cleansing thing that they spy did not understand. And Iraja because she had unique foreknowledge of the event.<br /><br />(In the "cleansed" version of the future, Iraja, Kumo, Naxk and Simone left following a prophecy about another dark nexus. Naxk joined them because he wanted to learn more about them, and avoid being killed.)<br /><br />Oraculum -- city with two nexuses -- invert one of them?<br /><br />Dark group sent to terminus to await arrival of the sword?<br />teleporting from dark to light, or light to dark, they cancel out and there is no teleportation sickness<br /><br />2) Saturday group inverts the Arx nexus<br />3) Arx gets inverted -- pull in Ryan &amp; Elise<br />4) Arx adapts, uses it to fuel undead-related stuff<br />5) Oraculum and Terminus then undergo the switch as well<br />6) But Terminus goes too far in their experiments with dark energy. As a result, portal strengthens and Grast is able to emerge (in avatar form) with an army of demons.</p><hr /><p>saturday group is tasked with a way to stabilize the structure?</p><p>1) research indicates: inverted nexuses do not collapse unless they are on the edge of the structure (connected to a non-inverted nexus)</p><p>2) need a mission that requires a small number of people...</p>      </div>
