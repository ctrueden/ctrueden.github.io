        <p><strong>Kith<br /></strong></p><p>Kith is hiding in the chimney for 1-2 rounds, expecting the guards to run into the room.</p><hr /><p><strong>Aftermath<br /></strong></p><p>1. Iraja is in the room. Adamatha enters. Admatha does her thing, absorbing divine essence from the sword; sword disintegrates.</p><p>2. Za'har Kool-Aids in through the window. Yos presumably enters as well. Kumo grants Za'har's wish...&nbsp;(see below)</p><p>3. Naxk is following Vance, and sees he is approaching the building. Naxk observes the dragonborn patrolling the streets all fall unconscious. Vance pauses and look pained, and then order his minions to "return to the Wood."</p><p>4. Vance proceeds into the building past the incapacitated dragonborn. up the stairs and into the room. Asks Admatha: "What have you done?"</p><p>5. Vance tells them about his reason for seeking the sword: stop it from being used to destroy the world. (He tells them stuff in line with Iraja's first doomsday scenario involving the Empire.)</p><p>6. He explains that there is a remaining threat:&nbsp;a name named Sahrit Doubain, who Vance warns them about: "he bears the mark of the sword and he must be stopped from using it at the place of power."</p><p>7. During this discussion, Pelor also shows up. If the Yoses are still asleep, they wake up due to Pelor's presence. Time stops when Pelor appears, but it doesn't affect Vance. Pelor and Vance are both momentarily surprised to see the other.</p><p>Pelor apologizes to Za'har for putting him in an impossible situation. "It seems even the power of the gods cannot change fate. However, while your actions have not preserved the life of the Emperor, what has transpired here has changed what is to come. Thank you for your service; the gods remember their debts." Pelor responds to questions, but takes his leave promptly after that, saying:&nbsp;"Henceforth, your names will be known to my followers."</p><p>8. Vance indicates to Naxk that he may be able to escape from his contract&nbsp;(see below).</p><p>9. Vance offers them an escort out of town, so there will be some undead protection, but there will be fighting versus the orcs.</p><hr /><p><strong>Path to the Temple of Sigil: </strong>Saturday group can meet Blue group during the final session this way...</p><p><strong>Path to the Nexus of Balance:</strong>&nbsp;Travel to Arx to engage in discussions regarding the nexus inversion...</p><hr /><p><strong>Kumo/Yos </strong>has never granted a wish of this magnitude before, trying to undo the damage done to a god, by a major artifact...</p><p>It drains him. The wish is partially granted, but the Emperor cannot be fully resurrected. The orcs warring in the streets are tainted, but the curse takes time to fully manifest.</p><p>Another Yos appears, but both fall unconscious, exhausted. If healed they can be awoken, but will remain exhausted for a week. Both Yoses remember who they are in actuality, as well as all the manufactured details of Yos. Neither one is capable of shedding his current form however. And one of the Yoses begins to remember details of his previous persona, Kumo, and the corresponding emotions are not wholly false...</p><hr /><p><strong>Vance tells Naxk</strong> tells Naxk:&nbsp;"I&nbsp;am the keeper of secrets. I&nbsp;have the answer that you seek.&nbsp;In exchange for your help saving the world, I&nbsp;will give you this answer. What say you?"</p><p>If Naxk isn't sure what "answer"&nbsp;Vance means:&nbsp;"It is not right that anyone should have to follow the whim of a devil. I&nbsp;know a way for you to escape your contract."</p><p>If Naxk agrees, Vance says:&nbsp;"You must offer your patron a tempting alternative to yourself. Extract the heart of a nexus and consume it, and you can transfer your curse from your body to the nexus. If you then call forth your patron, the devil may accept the tainted heart as a substitute for your soul. The nexus will soon collapse, but it is a small price to pay for your freedom."</p><p>If asked about his warlock powers:&nbsp;"So far as I&nbsp;know, this has only been attempted once before, and the situation was somewhat different. So I&nbsp;cannot speculate on how your abilities might be affected, except to say that they very well may be."</p><p>If asked about another way:&nbsp;"Perhaps you could descend into hell and slay your patron. If no one is there to collect on your debt, you would be effectively free.&nbsp;But I&nbsp;caution you against such a path, as your chances of success are highly suspect."</p><p>If Naxk wants to do the nexus thing, he would need to convince Iraja (or some other knowledgeable party)&nbsp;to extract a nexus for him, and then figure out how to eat/drink it. Afterward, his powers are changed:&nbsp;the fire and brimstone has become jets of ineffable energy that drive men insane. Those slain collapse into writhing, tentacled puddles of pseudonatural goop.</p><p>Naxk's patron:&nbsp;"Such a thing has never been proposed. Why do you presume to change the terms of our agreement bound in blood?"</p><hr /><p><strong>Admatha, Vashir and Naxk</strong> can roll Knowledge:&nbsp;Geography to know that the tunnels extend into the Wilds, but that those tunnels have never been fully explored, because it becomes too dangerous even for the best&nbsp;"cleaners."</p>      </div>
