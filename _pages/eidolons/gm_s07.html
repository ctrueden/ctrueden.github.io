This is easy to run, especially pre-Graz'zt. They can influence the plenipotentiary's decision to invert (or not) Arx. The main argument, apart from scientific advantages in their research, is that the drow family (Tal'Arabep and others) can feel the sweetness of the energy in the jar, and are pushing for it to happen. One family (Noroalwa), the eladrin, are against it, but are told they can refresh by visiting a linked city.</p><p>It is argued that though teleporter traffic will increase, the research possibilities, and ability to more effectively defend the city, will increase, and make it worthwhile. The people as a whole, with the exception of one prominent family, are in favor of the plan. Further, there was a recent prophecy of limitless nexus energy, stemming from such an inversion. (Iraja will have this vision when she reaches Arx.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Who is present during the deliberations</strong></span></p><p>Geomancers:</p><ul><li>Silius Vartarra - male eladrin - high geomancer of Arx (+20 to Bluff/Sense Motive)</li><li>Jenna - female dark-haired eladrin - high geomancer of Terminus (+15 to Sense Motive)</li><li>Brobuun - male eladrin - Jenna's aide (+5 to Sense Motive)</li><li>Tallahassee Wizzlesnaps - male gnome - left but came back - high geomancer of Intempestivus (+15 to Sense Motive)</li><li>Rudiger - male fire genasi - high geomancer of Oraculum (+15 to Sense Motive)</li><li>Talori - female blonde-haired eladrin "SPY" - left but came back - geomancer of Arx - the one who brought the info (+10 to Bluff/Sense Motive)</li></ul><p>Nobles:</p><ul><li>Jessane Tal'Arabep, Gwenvyth's mother - female gray-skinned elf - wants the inversion</li><li>Lorinal Noroelwa, Rebin's mother - female eladrin - against the inversion</li><li>Devin Truego - gray-skinned male elf, head of House Truego - argues against the inversion, but only as leverage to attain greater standing - confident and charming, well-dressed, carries a cane</li><li>Ziva Corosie - gray-skinned female elf, head of House Corosie - sucks up to Vanya, but tries to cajole her into accepting the inversion - flamboyantly dressed in bright colors, talks in a lazy lilt, often with a smile</li><li>Doll Calizuko - gray-skinned female elf, head of House&nbsp;Calizuko - calmly and logically argues that the inversion would be of benefit, and could save the world ultimately - cold and unsympathetic to arguments from emotion</li><li>Felleen Zonnia - water genasi (with dark lines), head of House Zonnia - against inverting Arx; would rather invert a&nbsp;"safer"&nbsp;nexus—becomes more ambivalent once the argument is presented that no other nexus would be as defensible; she is soft-spoken and easy swayed back and forth, but questions both sides startingly well - would propose Oraculum instead, but Rudiger&nbsp;(high geomancer of Oraculum)&nbsp;quickly skewers that idea:&nbsp;"There is no other place like Oraculum when it comes to prophecy. You would have us risk its destruction out of cowardice?"</li></ul><p>Authority:</p><ul><li>Vanya, female eladrin, plenipotentiary of Arx - cautious about the inversion, particularly because the Tal'Arabeps are for it - no nonsense, no bullshit, take no prisoners - very biased against Tal'Arabep, very forgiving of House Truego and House Corosie</li></ul><p>Outsiders:</p><ul><li>Sophia Fochlucan - staying at the Eternal Rest with the rest of the party</li><li>Kita Rosen - 20th level cleric (really Ch'shek Dob'y'slav), "a goblin shaman of the Wind Tamers." With nondetection (CL 33).<ul><li>Why did Atria Velan not come herself? "She is currently occupied in war councils with several other tribes."</li><li>1: shield of faith, entropic shield, divine favor</li><li>2: silence, bull's strength, bear's endurance, zone of truth</li><li>3: deeper darkness, magic vestment, protection from energy, invisibility purge</li><li>4: discern lies, greater magic weapon</li><li>5: scrying, true seeing</li></ul></li><li>Derros Rholle - 17th level tiefling wizard, disguise self into a male orc. Int 26. With nondetection (CL 33) - arrogant, thinks he's better than everyone, but half-assedly tries to hide it - wears a monocle&nbsp;(!), neatly filed tusks, neatly trimmed beard<br /><ul><li>two metamagic rods: maximize and silent/still</li><li>1: disguise self, mage armor, shield</li><li>2: scorching ray, cat's grace</li><li>3: nondetection, fly, haste, hold person</li><li>4: greater invisibility, enervation</li><li>5: teleport, cone of cold</li></ul></li><li>Jadia Bocio - 15th level drow rogue/assassin, with hat of disguise, as a female orc. Int 26. With nondetection (CL 33) - extremely quiet, only speaks when spoken to, quick to obey orders, especially violent ones - wears a tribal veil, useful against sandstorms, and culturally significant, too!&nbsp;(Naxk *has*&nbsp;seen such tribal veils on some orc women before)<br /><ul><li>brilliant energy dagger +2 and vorpal whip +2 (barbed to pierce armor)</li><li>death attack DC&nbsp;28&nbsp;(Fort save vs. disintegration in Admatha's case)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Others&nbsp;(not present):</p><ul><li>Gate guards are Jamack (gray elf) and Mon (ghoul). Jamack is due for a promotion, but seems mainly interested in following the rules to the letter. He didn't perform due diligence on their backgrounds (though he did take their names).</li><li>Daltor Zarregert - secretary at city hall</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Voting <br /></strong></span></p><p>In matters of the city in general, the Arx government works as follows:&nbsp;Vanya gets one vote. The geomancers get a total of two votes, depending on how they each vote individually. The noble houses each get one vote.</p><p>For Delphian decisions falling under the purview of research not affecting the people, the situation is reversed:&nbsp;Vanya gets one vote, the relevant researchers each get a vote, and the noble houses get two votes in total.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PCs<br /></strong></span></p><p>Admatha - Councilor Ch’shek Dob’y’slav appears at Arx, for two reasons:</p><ol><li>She has a theory about Admatha:<ul><li>Speak with dead on several murder victims revealed Budzh’sh, her great grandson, as the murderer.</li><li>Speak with dead on HIM revealed he had been killed before he supposedly murdered anyone.</li><li>Budzh’sh has much more successfully and subtly murdered people in the past.</li><li>Budzh’sh's body had a lingering aura of necromancy.</li><li>Admatha, an unknown necromancer, showed up only a couple of months after these events went down.</li><li>Already suspicious, the Councilor kept a close watch on Admatha, and learned as much as she could about her.</li><li>She occasionally scries Admatha. She did not see Admatha in bhut form; however, she has seen her in different bodies over time.</li><li>She scries them during a conversation when they decide to travel to Arx, and hears about the possible nexus inversion.</li><li>Nukpana's body was never found, despite excavation of the collapsed nexus.</li></ul></li><li>Now that she knows something is going down at Arx regarding the nexus inversion, she goes personally.</li><li>She weasels her way onto the deciding council, posing as a shaman from the wastes (though in actuality she is a priestess of Lolth). She claims she was present at the Fochlucan incident, when the nexus collapsed.</li><li>Sophia Fochlucan has a different memory—of Iraja and Kumo successfully healing the nexus, and of them traveling to Midgard following another one of Iraja's prophecies, along with Simone and Naxk. If asked, she elaborates that Iraja saw a vision of the site of the Midgard nexus, with an immense tree growing downward into the earth, and a fruit at the bottom that "must be eaten." (The fruit symbolizes Iraja's ability to see dark prophecy, after visiting a dark nexus. In some way or another, it was destiny that she became capable of seeing these visions.)</li></ol><p>Iraja - Has a prophecy at Arx about limitless energy, stemming from the inversion; can argue with the geomancers of Arx. She sees a Delphian nexus erupt in energy that washes over the whole world like water, with verdant growth everywhere—an explosion of life.</p><ul><li>DC 30 geomancy: The energy appears to be translucent, unlike energy she's seen before</li><li>DC&nbsp;40 geomancy: The vibrance of color indicates that the plants are more filled with life once they have been touched by this energy; something has changed since her last vision, but it is not clear which&nbsp;(or neither or both) may truly occur</li><li>DC 50 geomancy:&nbsp;The energy is in "balance"&nbsp;somehow, seems to have only the best qualities of both, without the negative qualities of either, normal and inverted energy</li></ul><p>Kumo - Shinkumo and Shiki live with the nomads, and felt the partial wish from across the world, unlike any other before it. Kumo may be able to contact them, but how to find where they are? If so, they are expecting him.</p><p>Naxk - Has never heard those names for orcs before. But has seen an orcish veil.</p><p>Vashir - Ultimately looking for power that could give him back the life he had. Limitless nexus energy might be able to do that...</p><p>Za'har - Prevent inversion of the nexuses? Stop Sahrit.</p><hr /><p>Vashir and Za'har shared a mentor, who practiced both styles. Once the Nexus in Balance appears, he is inextricably drawn to it, and they meet him again at Oraculum.</p>      </div>
