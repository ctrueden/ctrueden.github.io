        <p><a href="/eidolons/gm/dark/7">Session 7 notes</a> are still very relevant.</p><p>Decision has been rendered.<br />Admatha finds a couple of withered (not Withered) orcs living in Arx's walls.<br />Everyone is allowed to leave.<br /><br />That night, party is arrested, and charged with war crimes: attacking the lineship.</p><ul><li>Admatha - war crimes, and accused of murder in Kita Rosen's "far-off land"<ul><li>cannot teleport Admatha back to their lands; she is not willing</li><li>Delphians agree to allow Kita Rosen to bring additional officials from her land to pursue a trial at Arx</li></ul></li><li>Kumo - no proof he was involved in anything; held on suspicion of his involvement</li><li>Iraja, Naxk, Vashir - war crimes (lineship battle)</li><li>Za'har - defended the lineship<ul><li>investigate his link; was he a double agent?</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Arrest<br /></strong></span></p><p>Lemeth Hawn – gray elf Constable spellthief 10/shadowdancer 2/mindbender 4, detect thoughts at will—arrests them while they are sleeping. Has an item to teleport individuals directly into the Delphian prison.</p><p>Hawn has Jessane Tal'Arabep (a widow) eternally charmed. And Hawn is actually Gwenvyth's father.</p><p>Kita Rosen has volunteered her people to catch Admatha. Lemeth Hawn confronts Admatha, warning her that he has these people at his disposal, but it would be easier on everyone if she acquiesced to the teleport instead of taking her chances with being "subdued" by the outsiders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jail cells</strong></span></p><ul><li>All equipment confiscated.</li><li>Antimagic field in every cell. Permanent forcecage for each cell.</li><li>Delphian prison lock -- disable device DC 40 (50 without thieves' tools).</li><li>Arcane locks on the doors increase the DC to unlock or break the doors by 10.</li><li>Undead and living guards -- two pairs.</li><li>One row of cells -- can't see each other, but can hear each other.</li><li>Also some solitary cells used as needed (e.g., someone misbehaves).</li><li>Delphian ghost-touch, mage-bane manacles (escape artist DC 40, strength check DC 33).</li><li>Only the cells themselves are antimagical -- the hall is not.</li><li>The doors themselves have no keys -- they respond to "authorized" people similar to other Delphian security.</li><li>Break difficulty on the doors (barred door with an arcane lock) is also DC 35.</li><li>Hallway has an alarm: only prison personnel, and those touching them, avoid setting it off.</li><li>Stone walls (3 feet thick hewn stone) has hardness 8, with 540 hit points, and a break DC of 50.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Trial</strong></span></p><p>There is a trial/inquiry regarding all of their involvement. It involves lots of zones of truth, discern lies, etc., to determine the truth of their involvement in the lineship attack.</p><p>If Admatha exposes the secret of the Underdark, Kita Rosen will bring in witnesses to testify. Either way, she herself with testify that Admatha has murdered several of her people. Rosen refuses to answer certain questions about her homeland, saying that her people are very secretive.</p><p>The trial takes the better part of a month to play out. Escape attempts are dealt with expertly. A "true seeing" field enacted in the court room reveals the true forms of all accused. So Vashir is revealed as a rakshasa, Admatha as a bhut, and Kumo as a kitsune.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Verdict</strong></span></p><p>If the truth comes out: they are all guilty, except Za'har, who is cleared of all charges.</p><p>Those guilty are sentenced to "reconditioning," except for Admatha, who is sentenced to death. "Ordinarily, with crimes of this severity, you would be executed and your remains raised as undead. Unfortunately, as you have no remains, this is an infeasible procedure. Hence, we have opted for a lesser-used but still appropriate technique: nexo-protonic discorporation. We have never attempted the process on a sentient withered before; but rest assured, if the procedure fails we will find an alternative method to destroy you."</p><p>For the others, they are sentenced to spiritual reconditioning (the war crimes are too serious to use a simple Oath). The conditioning requires them to be suffused with nexus energy for an extended period, and swear several Oaths of various sorts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Van Wagram's plan<br /></strong></span></p><p>He knows about the Underdark. (So does Dragontamer, but Ironheart and Bloodletter do not.) Thus, he is marshaling troops to: A) protect Elyria from anticipated attacks from the Underdark in retaliation for the nexuses being collapsed; and B) protect Elyria from the predicted onslaught of Delphian demons. He has used these reasons (particularly the demons) as an excuse to declare martial law throughout Elyria. He has no overt intentions to attack any other Imperial province.</p><p>He does want to vampirize the high priests of Bahamut eventually, to secure his power base further. But that is largely irrelevant to the current situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Crisis in the Underdark<br /></strong></span></p><p>After the verdict, but before the reconditioning begins, Kita Rosen visits Vashir and Naxk in prison. She arranges to speak with them both -- Vashir is thrown into Naxk's cell. She reveals her true form to them (dark elf) and explains what is happening to the inverted nexuses back home: they are being collapsed. "The Empire has gone mad, and it will be the ruin of us all." She claims she can assure their release in exchange for their help in stopping these atrocities. They need only pledge their loyalty to House Dob'y'slav of Tane'klenya.</p><p>"Our people have declared war on the Empire, and will be arriving en masse soon, unless we can kill the problem at the source. In order to prevent the Underdark's collapse, we must kill Rory Beardthicket before he can do any more damage. Further, I propose we also target the Marquis of Elyria, Soren van Wagram. My reasoning is thus: Elyria has most of the remaining dark nexuses within the Empire. Destabilizing their leadership, and thus their military chain of command, may allow us to gain control of these nexuses on the surface."</p><p>If the PCs seem to want additional rationale for targeting Van Wagram: "Striking at Van Wagram will strengthen our military position. We must demonstrate our capability to destroy the Empire should it ever violate our treaty again."</p><p>Dob'y'slav also contacts Za'har, and explains to him the truth about the dark nexuses. Her ulterior motive is to have a bona fide member of the Empire endorsing her actions, and lending his inside knowledge of the Empire to her task.</p><p>The goal is to find and kill Rory Beardthicket. Unbeknownst to anyone except Rory and Sora, his illicit dragonborn apprentice, Sora also knows the mechanism. The two of them are working together to collapse nexuses twice as quickly (individually).</p><p>There is a city in Elyria with a dark nexus, where Van Wagram currently resides. The plan is to go there, kill Van Wagram, have Vashir take his place, and set a trap at that nexus for Beardthicket when he arrives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vance's jailbreak</strong></span></p><p>Naxk and Vashir get a free pass thanks to Dob'y'slav's efforts.</p><p>Dob'y'slav tells Admatha the truth about who she is, and lords it over her a bit: "I have the power to sway your fate... beg me." When Admatha refuses, Dob'y'slav leaves.</p><p>When Vance detects Sahrit in the Temple of Sigil, he immediately teleports to Arx to find the party. He learns of their arrest and visits the prison. He zombifies the guards and orders them to free the party. "My son has reached his destination. If you wish to be free of this place, aid me now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Predicted breakdown for joint session</strong></span></p><p>Red - Za'har, Naxk, Vashir<br />Blue - Admatha, Iraja, Kumo</p>      </div>
