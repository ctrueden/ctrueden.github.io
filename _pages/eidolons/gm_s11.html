        <p>In the Empire, where Rory Beardthicket finally springs the trap:</p><ul><li>Admatha - quake her into the situation, done</li><li>Iraja - more prophecy, hooray</li><li>Kumo - politicking with Ironheart, and keeping in touch with Za'har</li><li>Naxk - assists in setting a trap for Rory Beardthicket</li><li>Vashir - living the good life, holding on to power, building alliances, holding banquets (he's got big balls), whatever</li><li>Za'har - pursuing balance, seeking answers</li></ul><p>Party comes together:</p><ul><li>Naxk, Vashir and Za'har are all notified that the trap is sprung.</li><li>Iraja is forewarned and meets them there essentially in advance. Possibly she contacted them and told them in advance as well.</li><li>Kumo definitely cares about this guy one way or another, and maybe was also notified (thanks to his contact with Za'har).</li><li>Admatha quakes in during the nexus attack.</li></ul><div><strong>Bahamut's Crusaders:</strong> the faction pledged to assist Beardthicket in the destruction of the nexuses; they always cause a distraction to provide cover for Rory.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Lagos Idewu:</strong>&nbsp;a renegade Oni warlock, who is secretly one of Dragontamer's informants, is helping Beardthicket for his own reasons, and knows many secrets of the hells as he was once very high up in the warlock organization.</div><ul><li>Lagos has told Dragontamer the truth, corroborating what the Emperor himself announced. But Dragontamer needs total proof before he can act overtly treasonously toward the priesthood.</li><li>Thus, Dragontamer visits the Priest of the White personally, now that he has regained the trust of his dragon steed Tarlisis (a white dragon that Dragontamer defeated and subsequently redeemed).</li><li>He promises Tiamat that he will do everything in his power to deliver one of the Orbs of Dragonkind (which he found out about from Lagos) into the Priest of the White's hands. Ideally, he will acquire both. In exchange, Tiamat tells him the actual truth. She also tells him the locations in Hell of the two Orbs, to increase his chance of success.</li><li>Thus, Dragontamer recruits one of the groups of PCs to infiltrate hell and steal one of the Orbs. If possible, they can try to collect both, but capturing either is insanely dangerous. Also ideally, they are to recover the soul of one Lagos Idewu so that it may be returned to him.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>The Trap:&nbsp;</strong>Alarm spells are permanently rigged around every remaining nexus in the Empire. However, Beardthicket routinely dispels these wards before acting. However, Vashir's faction sets a better trap at the Elyrian nexus, by infusing the neighboring walls with magically phosphorescent material. The Norns are ordered to fall prey (intentionally) to any distraction or attack, so that Beardthicket thinks the coast is clear. But the material stops glowing when he dispels the alarm, someone sees and notifies the party.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>However, Beardthicket is too smart for any of this. He walks right into the Elyrian palace to speak to "van Wagram" directly. He claims to come to parley, and expects them to honor this request for neutral discussion and attempt at resolution. Beardthicket attempts to convince the PCs that collapsing all the nexuses is a good thing, because it will cut off contact with the undesirable outer planes. Closing these portals, he argues, is vital. And this new threat, the Ordering, can even cause quakes in the Empire! *vehemence* *quake in Admatha and some plague zombies* "You see!!!"</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>*fight with plague zombies*</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Meanwhile, Sora is in the nexus, collapsing it. She cast another alarm to cover up the one she dispelled, to keep the phosphorescent walls glowing.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>After talking to them for an hour, if it lasts that long, there is a small rumbling explosion noise from beneath the palace, and Beardthicket says, "Oop, gotta go! Thanks for the audience," and teleports away.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Later that day, Dragontamer contacts Za'har and expresses his condolences (assuming the nexus was collapsed).</div><blockquote><div><div>My condolences on the loss of Elyria's nexus.&nbsp;Dragontamer has discovered information of utmost importance.&nbsp;Please come to Alexandria at once.&nbsp;Bring only those you trust with your life.</div></div></blockquote><div>At Alexandria:&nbsp;A compelling woman clad in white, with eyes the color of ice, is with him. He asks Vashir in private: "Who do you trust?" and assembles that group. "I need you all to go to hell," he tells them. Specifically, Stygia the 5th (or if no Ryan: Maladomini the 7th).</div><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Frozen Lake is a portal to Stygia, specifically to the frozen lake where Moradin is entombed and the Xyxical dwells.</li><li>Someone in Alexandria's palace is the first Emperor's mirror. Representing his vanity, it is a portal into the 7th layer of hell. It would take them into the Archduke's palace.</li></ul><div>Dragontamer spends a significant time talking to them, and helping them prepare, arming them with knowledge. He introduces them to Lagos, who can assist them further.</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Migration:</strong></p><ul><li>REMAIN: Admatha, Naxk, Vashir, Za'har -&gt; Saturday Blue [Alexandria]</li><li>QUAKE OUT: Iraja, Kumo -&gt; Saturday Red [Plague]</li></ul>      </div>
