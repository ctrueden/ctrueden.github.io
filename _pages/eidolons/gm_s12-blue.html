Hopefully, Za'har believes him.</p><p>Once in Alexandria, the party encounters Emperor Valens the Youth, training with Delia, Dragontamer's white dragon associate.</p><p><strong>Kas:</strong></p><ul><li>Present at the beginning of both groups, post-quake.</li><li>Haroun: "You are progressing well."<ul><li>When Kas is explaining to Sahrit the components of the soulstriking weapon, Kas's words trigger an Empty Prophecy.</li></ul></li><li>Sahrit: Tells him of the components needed to forge a soulstriking weapon, capable of destroying Vance:<ul><li>The redeemed soul from brother's body, kept by the Vanquisher</li><li>The body of the elf formerly possessed by his brother</li><li>A bone from a powerful psuedonatural, substantial enough to be made into a sword</li><li>Truenaming knowledge</li><li>Blessings from Vecna</li><li>Remains from one of the incarnations of Kas's Sword</li></ul></li></ul><p>Dragontamer tells the party the truth about Tiamat and Bahamut:</p><ul><li>In divine connection with his deity, he was told to seek the truth from Glandur, the Priest of the White.</li><li>He visited Glandur, to ask Tiamat herself for the truth.</li><li>In return, he agreed to a task: the recovery of an Orb of Dragonkind from Hell itself.</li><li>Though he was told of a portal to Hell in Alexandria palace, he is unable to activate it.</li><li>He implores the party to go in his stead.</li><li>Tiamat has pledged her full support of this attempt.</li><li>The orb is located on the 7th layer of hell, Maladomini, in Baalzebul himself's possession. They will need to ask him for it back. :-)</li></ul><p>Dragontamer also predicts what will happen once they bring back the Orb:</p><ul><li>The orb is cursed, but there is a plan to uncurse it.</li><li>Dragontamer predicts the five high priests will argue over who is to control it (he pledged it to them, at least temporarily).</li><li>He would like the party's help in concocting a plan to eventually wrest control of the orb back into good hands.</li></ul><p><strong>Fused consciousness:&nbsp;</strong>Since the Hells are singular planes, and multiple eidolons are traveling there at once, they sort of temporarily fuse. They feel stray thoughts and memories from other versions of their lives. Mechanically, they gain experience and expertise allowing them to use a free action point with each d20 roll, in addition to any they would normally spend.</p><p>[explore Baalzebul's palace – see BoVD p. 158-161]</p><ul><li>Teurn, Wysturak and Yaghoq the pit fiend bodyguards</li><li>Vashaak Ratoth Bruu the male medusa servant</li><li><a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-lists-and-details/-o/otyugh">Otyughs</a> that keep the feces in check</li><li>Large number of ghargatula personal guards</li></ul><p>Baalzebul (BoVD p. 158) was the first emperor, and possessed the remaining orb of dragonkind:</p><ul><li>He was a geomancer, had a wife and kids, wife was lost to the flow.</li><li>He saw a prophecy that caused him to start the Empire.</li><li>Asmodeus, as a woman, assisted him in forming the Empire and spreading its influence across the world.</li><li>Asmodeus claimed her world.</li><li>Baalzebul resisted the tyranny, with some number of loyal followers.</li><li>They were all either slain in combat vs. devils, or withered to death (and became Hell Rot zombies).</li><li>Baalzebul now rules the 7th layer of hell, Maladomini.</li></ul><p>Baalzebul is cursed to carry the orb forever:</p><ul><li>His form is grotesque and huge, and emits noxious gases (e.g., cloudkill).</li><li>The orb has grown into Baalzebul's body.</li><li>Only one willing to accept Asmodeus's curse can choose to bear the orb.</li><li>To bear it would free Baalzebul from his curse.</li><li>The transformation (both ways) is immediate and terrible.</li></ul><p>The new bearer will be cursed, and be placed under the thrall of Tiamat.

He does not want to see history repeated on more worlds. Thus, he may tell them about the his withered plague servants sent to sow chaos and spread the vile plague Hell Rot.</li><li><strong>Moradin:&nbsp;</strong>Baalzebul does not know the truth about Moradin. He tells them that Moradin has taken the name "Levistus" and is now the ruler of the fifth level of Hell, Stygia.</li><li><strong>The other orb:&nbsp;</strong>Baalzebul confirms the fact that Asmodeus has the other orb of dragonkind, and getting it would be nigh-impossible.</li><li><strong>Naxk's pact:&nbsp;</strong>Baalzebul, as a geomancer, was expecting the party. As such, he has prepared a new contract for Naxk (specifically to piss off Asmodeus). He offers Naxk the chance to change allegiance. The new contract book is just one page, with the line: "In exchange for infernal power in life, I agree to serve Baalzebul in death."</li></ul><p><strong>Cliffhanger:&nbsp;</strong>Once they return to the mortal realm, Dragontamer is waiting with all five high priests of Tiamat:&nbsp;"There isn't much time; we must begin the uncursing ritual at once!"</p>      </div>
