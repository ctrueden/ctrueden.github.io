They are protecting it from Beardthicket, and all attackers. They helped to drive off the plague withered.</li><li>They explain that they hid the populace in the city's temples, and the zombies never entered, for whatever reason. "Perhaps hallowed ground is anathema to them." The Norns report that none of the zombies approached within many thousands of feet of the sequestered nexus; as a result, no Norns raised a blade against any undead.</li></ul><p><strong>A nexus in balance:</strong></p><ul><li>Lays withered to rest.</li><li>Cures Hell Rot.</li><li>Nerull is (surprisingly, perhaps, to Admatha) in favor of the nexus in balance.</li><li>Would restore Admatha to life (though she remains a cleric of Nerull).</li><li>Initially, creating the nexus in balance at Oraculum is possible.</li><li>Would need a catalyst to cause it to spread across the world in a chain reaction.</li></ul><p>If Iraja seeks prophecy at Manavendra, or plays back the nexus in balance prophecy, it will now show the energies cleansing the undead.

(Fuck that guy.)</li><li>If shown Iraja's vision, could postulate that should two major nexuses be drawn close enough together, when one is normal and one is inverted, it may be possible to formulate a ritual merging their energies. Failure would result in quite probably one of the most destructive releases of energy the world has ever seen. And of course, there's no guarantee it would work.</li><li>Ed will probably want to search for two such nexuses close enough together—and he will realize the twin nexuses of Oraculum might work.</li></ul><p><strong>Graz'zt's Oraculum takeover:</strong></p><ul><li>Through dark prophecy, Graz'zt had foreknowledge that Oraculum could be his undoing.</li><li>He knew he must protect the nexuses there, so he moved his main force there and inverted both nexuses.</li></ul><p><strong>Cliffhanger:</strong>&nbsp;Ed sees that both the Oraculum nexuses have been inverted...</p>      </div>
