He tells them:</p><blockquote><p>"Allow me to give you a warning: should you choose to seek out and confront Levistus, to determine the truth of what has happened to him, be warned that he has regained his Hammer. It is said that the only way to kill Moradin is for one of his own creations to be used against him. Take heart, at least, in the knowledge that he does not yet have his Crown, which would grant him true immortality."</p></blockquote><p>After they leave Hell, five priests of tiamat are waiting in Alexandria with Dragontamer:</p><ul><li>Important Personality Stuff for the Undefined Three:</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>Glandur (White, male): Driven for power, but aware that he is the weakest of the five.&nbsp; After being gifted with the head of the frost giant king, has been making inroads with the Frost Giants to obtain their support in exchange for 'protection'.&nbsp; Is now Mordollwen's mate, but still respects and fears Narylfiel.&nbsp; Would have a difficult time choosing between them, but ultimately he would side with Mordollwen.&nbsp; He will appear to the party as a Devan man in white armor, clearly a mockery of that which Dragontamer wears.&nbsp; A stark-white cape will flap in a nonexistant breeze behind him, and his white hair will fall to his waist.&nbsp; He will make a point of speaking up whenever it is expedient, as long as he isn't countermanding Mordollwen or Narylfiel.</li><li>Erynion (Green, female): Driven by a deeper understanding of the world.&nbsp; Spends most of her time with the Nomadic tribes, where she has several guises.&nbsp; Those who would seek her out would first need to discover her identity.&nbsp; Has the ability to redirect any divination by a mortal being to see what she wishes.&nbsp; Mordollwen's prophecies and Erynion's deception intrigue her, and so she has largely made herself remain on good terms with them.&nbsp; She will appear to the party as an ordinary-looking elven woman with brown hair and eyes draped in a simple green robe.&nbsp; Divinations will reveal nothing, and she herself will say little.</li><li>Alagos (Blue, male): Driven by a desire to secure the people of the Wastes as a power in the world.&nbsp; Has been approached by several tribal leaders to learn the secrets of the Wastes, and has given them in exchange for alliance.&nbsp; Of all of the others, he only respects Mordollwen, whose ability with prophecy intrigues him.&nbsp; He is jealous of Glandur for obtaining Mordollwen's favor, finds Erynion simple and Narylfiel overly violent.&nbsp; He will appear to the party as a gnoll in brilliant azure full plate, cloaked and hooded.</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>Mordollwen will look sadly? possessively? (Sense Motive?) at Sahrit, but not speak to him on matters of significance unless he approaches her.&nbsp; She will however take any threat on him personally, and declare him to be of use to her</li><li>If they want to try to obtain the crown from Narylfiel, they may discuss that</li><li>Dragons' Likes and Dislikes:</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>Mordollwen:&nbsp; Likes Glandur and Erynion.&nbsp; Dislikes Alagos and Narylfiel.</li><li>Narylfiel:&nbsp; Likes Alagos and Glandur.&nbsp; Dislikes Erynion and Mordollwen.</li><li>Glandur:&nbsp; Likes Mordollwen and Narylfiel.&nbsp; Dislikes Erynion and Alagos.</li><li>Erynion:&nbsp; Likes Mordollwen and Alagos.&nbsp; Dislikes Glandur and Narylfiel.</li><li>Alagos:&nbsp; Likes Mordollwen.&nbsp; Dislikes Glandur, Erynion and Narylfiel.</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>script some stuff about prophecies, since mordollwen is an oracle</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>Something about the hammer</li><li>Something about the return of the other orb</li><li>At least once she will force herself to say nothing, but stare straight at Dragontamer</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>none of the priests wants to bear the burden, but they REALLY don't want dragontamer doing it</li><li>they try to convince each other to do it</li><li>discussion (presumably in secret) with dragontamer about wresting the orb back, eventually, to reinvigorate bahamut</li></ul><p>Whichever priest ends up with it will start to transform into something horrible with claws and tendrils, but quickly revert to something resembling themselves, but fiendish, with the stench and other feces and such present.</p><p>Cliffhanger:</p><ul><li>If the orb is given up, and the party goes to confront Levistus (and look for Rebin) immediately, the cliffhanger will be their entry into the Hells.</li><li>If the party offers to hold on to the Orb until the curse can be lifted, then the cliffhanger may be the same, or it may be when the orb is uncursed, time permitting.</li><li>If the party (or just Naxk) refuses to give up the orb and runs,
the cliffhanger can be that there are five angry dragon high priests
after them!</li><li>If they choose to scheme with Dragontamer to reacquire the orb from the priests, break the curse, etc., the cliffhanger could be something that Delia says (she could potentially be pretty insightful about the Tiamat priests, especially Alagos).</li></ul>      </div>
