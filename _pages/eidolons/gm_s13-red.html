Scout it out. Learn that Graz'zt has transferred his base of power there.</li><li>Try to raise an army:<ul><li>Talk to the Vanquisher to gain Horde assistance</li><li>Find sympathetic Delphians (Arx, Sibyl) and Fey (the warrior clan)</li><li>Joesph: visit the Raven Queen, to reunite with Anne (Isaline can help!)</li><li>Isaline: could call on the forces of Elyria (Boris would offer to extend the Underdark's protection to Elyria...)</li><li>Ed and Biger: could call on the hospitalers as an elite unit</li><li>Iraja: could try to contact Sophia, or nomad allies</li><li>Kumo: something with the Blue Hand?</li><li>Visit the Platypods in the Wilds?!?</li><li>Call on the aid of other PCs?</li><li>Ask the gods?</li></ul></li></ul><p>If they visit the Raven Queen:</p><ul><li>They reach the shadar kai village</li><li>Biger notices that Wrin is gone—he is no longer riding him—but he cannot recall exactly when that happened. Did he dismount? Doesn't remember that... [the Raven Queen does not allow Wrin because he is a direct conduit to Garl Glittergold]</li><li>Villagers tell Joe he is one of them; Joe remembers several of the villagers</li><li>Corvidae also dwells within the village, and greets Isaline warmly, thanking her for bringing peace to his soul</li><li>When Joe disappeared, Jennifer did too</li><li>But Anne is here, waiting for Joe, at Joe's cottage</li><li>The Lady (Raven Queen) can appear to the devout at her temple, in erinyes form (Lucifer's original form)</li><li>She is wearing a cold iron bracelet with twenty chain links (which she cannot remove)</li><li>If Joe asks about Jennifer... "She has been with you all along"</li><li>Boccob shows up (looks human, very similar to Vance except with two working eyes and obviously still a living being) to discuss how she's been "more active" lately<ul><li>"What are you plotting?" he asks with suspicion.</li><li>Raven Queen: "I am under no obligation to answer any of your questions. You are not welcome here."</li><li>Boccob: "Playing with other gods' toys even, I see" and gestures at both warforged.</li><li>Boccob: "Well, if Wee Jas isn't going to do anything about your antics, perhaps I should."</li><li>Raven Queen: "YOUR portfolio is UNdeath, not death. Or at least it WAS, until it was reclaimed."</li><li>Boccob: "*snarl* You have been bringing souls of the dead back into the world... perhaps I'll just ask one of them directly." And he invokes <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells---final/grasping-hand">grasping hand</a>. To learn Joe's secrets, he must pull Joe to him. On the other hand, even if he succeeds at this, it will not help him much.</li><li>The Raven Queen transforms into the Lady of Pain to protect Joe, dispersing the avatar in a burst of deadly chains.</li></ul></li><li>Presumably, the party will have questions about this afterward.</li><li>She will be limitedly willing to answer them. Specifically:<ul><li>Joe being a combination of two souls.</li><li>Half of his essence made it possible for Anne to retain her consciousness.</li><li>Urges them to pursue the creation of a nexus in balance. To Kumo: "You seek great change in this world: this will undoubtably be a direction of interest to you and your kind."</li><li>She wants them to swear an Oath on the Raven Queen not to discuss anything that they have seen in the realm of shadow.</li><li>In return, she promises to lend her aid directly against Graz'zt when the time comes.</li></ul></li></ul>      </div>
