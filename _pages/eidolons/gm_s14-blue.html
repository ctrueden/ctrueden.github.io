        <p><strong>Plotline:</strong> The Hells</p><p><strong>Migration:</strong></p><ul><li>REMAIN – Admatha, Arwel, Sahrit, Za'har</li><li>PLUS – Simone</li><li>MINUS – Naxk, Vashir</li></ul><p><strong>Location:</strong> Narlfiel's abandoned lair in the fifth Hell</p><p>Does the egg hatch? No, but it begins to glow. If they keep zapping it, the shell will eventually glow to white and then dissipate, leaving a newborn red dragon in a pile of goo. It will begin shivering and crying. Zapping it again will make it gurgle with happiness and contentment. But it will need cooked meat very soon, or it will start crying again.</p><p>Vashir and Naxk are torn away from a rift with chains that encircle them. This "quake" has no vertigo. Simone is deposited in their place.</p><p>When the chains touch Simone, she sees visions of the past:</p><ul><li>Veccob: "There is a task that you must perform for me if you wish me to keep your secret. Melora has become... an obstacle. We shall pay her a little visit..."</li><li>Lucifer (still wearing the holy symbol) crying, in chains, embracing a bald human man, also in chains, with lined features: "I love you, Tharizdun"</li><li>Lucifer (wearing the same holy symbol as Ericks Goldsmith) leading 
an army of humans into battle, her allies being cut down by Moradin, her
 facing off against Moradin...</li></ul><p>To escape, they can visit any other known portal. In Alexandria, for example, there is a portal to the 7th hell. But how can they know that?</p><p>[Ad lib this!]</p><p>Once they escape, they can go back in and try to melt Moradin.</p><ul><li>If they succeed, Moradin is weak, and in a near-comatose state, and he says, "Find my son"</li><li>But Levistus will show up again when they try to melt Moradin</li><li>Levistus tries to reason with the party<ul><li>"You think you know what's best for the world, but you don't. What do you think will happen if you release him? Do you think you will be making the world a better place? You will collapse the Empire, and all of those people who rely on HIS (points at Moradin) essence to survive will wither and die!"</li><li>Real danger of Moradin being killed and his essence being stolen by Levistus (because Levistus would rather have it than let it dissipate or be taken by someone else, after all)</li><li>Is Levistus right that this could collapse the Empire? (Levistus doesn't want to feed the dwarves, and Tiamat is now half free)</li></ul></li><li>Levistus knows the proverbial jig is up. He can either kill them, or join them, but the knowledge of the imprisoned Moradin may still leak.</li></ul><p><strong>Character stuff:<br /></strong></p><ul><li>Simone: Can perceive Asmodeus's erosion... does any of that happen this time? If they <a href="/eidolons/gm/plotlines">go back to Fochlucan</a>, perhaps.</li><li>Arwel: Lots of Tat'enda stuff... need to get her into the Ordering plotline after next Friday.</li><li>Za'har: Discussion with Levistus should be interesting enough for him.</li><li>Admatha: Levistus tries to convince her that helping Asmodeus is in Nerull's best interest (all become withered!). If necessary, references conversation at the Temple of Sigil.</li><li>Sahrit: Once they leave Hell, if they have the baby dragon, Mordollwen might get involved...?</li></ul>      </div>
