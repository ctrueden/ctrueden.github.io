their war cry</li></ul></li><li>Rituals include:<ul><li>gray render bonding ceremony (if it fails, the cub is killed)</li><li>pre-battle body painting is done but not particularly formal</li><li>new life being born is very serious—parents are told they must teach the child to survive effectively</li><li>coming of age is very serious—young people are warned they must now ultimately rely on themselves</li><li>death is celebrated with a festival, especially if the deaths saved other lives, or the battle went well as a result</li></ul></li><li>Big emphasis on body paint along the arms and legs (grants divine favor effect—but not on the face; "paste gets in your eyes")</li><li>Major deity: Ehlonna—she is more youthful and involved than Obad-Hai</li><li>Also big: Corellon—often depicted as Ehlonna's father in their culture, and a mighty warrior</li><li>Many rangers with animal companions (of more "normal" sorts than the Echidnox have)</li><li>One order of monks as well that practice an art focused on tumbling and kicking<br /><ul><li>Myl os Val came from this tribe (Calanon left the Harion and met her here)</li><li>So Ed's art looks very familiar!</li></ul></li><li>Travel with very large beasts—<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/grayRender.htm">gray renders</a> that have bonded to chosen warriors—used as both beasts of burden and during fighting</li></ul><p>Events:</p><ul><li>Suspicious of massive horde activity, the T'Sen watched them, and 
learned of the Terminas attack<ul><li>They knew Terminas was infested with 
demons... but they could not bring 
themselves to help their ancient enemy.</li></ul></li><li>Quite preoccupied with the Terminas situation—who are these "Platypods" and what do they want?</li><li>Sidolphus, plenipotentiary of Terminas, is in captivity of the T'Sen<ul><li>She fled Terminas when Graz'zt emerged, to seek help, but the T'Sen blamed her for the incident</li><li>They will only help undo the harm she has done once she admits that the Delphian way of life is irresponsible</li></ul></li><li>Sibyl, plenipotentiary of Oraculum, is here as well<ul><li>Had a prophecy about Sidolphus, and the PCs, near Terminas</li><li>"The beginnings of healing the bond between our peoples"</li><li>She escaped Oraculum during the confusion of Graz'zt's death</li><li>She tells the party about the events of Oraculum, the nexus in balance, etc.</li><li>But the T'Sen treat her similarly, in that they blame her for the state of Delphia, <em>especially</em> since she claims to be a prophet</li></ul></li></ul><p>Problems:</p><ul><li>Cursed temple gives Asmodeus the erosion power<ul><li>But the Ordered nexuses 
have magnified its power, so it is now very noticeable</li><li>Party experiences the past eroding—"the whole lens has changed"<br /><ul><li>Simone does not see the Vanquisher at all—in no reality was he there</li><li>Simone &amp; Za'har must make Will saves to even remember him being there last session</li></ul></li><li>Afterward, Simone can perceive that the probabilities have actually suddenly changed</li></ul></li><li>Platypods now believe that Delphia's technology is bringing about the Calamity (due to the demons), and have decided to exterminate the Delphian way of life<ul><li>They probably can be reasoned with, but they are highly dangerous</li><li>They cannot refresh except in the Wilds—but some of their geomancers stored a large quantity of essence into each of them</li><li>They distill their own poison and reapply it to their claws—primary Fort save or 4d6 Con, secondary 2d6 Con (DC 20 + 1/2 HD + Con modifier)</li><li>Claws also destroy metal as a <a href="http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-lists-and-details/-r/rust-monster">rust monster</a> (Reflex save for attended items is DC 20 + 1/2 HD + Con modifier)</li></ul></li></ul>      </div>
