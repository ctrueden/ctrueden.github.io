He follows... feels himself lose consciousness. At this point, Joe receives his dream (Mark chooses). Then, he awakens to the sound of a towering monstrosity sniffing him. It licks him, then swallows him whole. He must then find a way out of its belly.</p><p>Being near the Temple of Sigil, he feels his Soul Eater powers strongly empowered. He can, with time and effort, drain the Tarrasque and absorb it into his mind. After he does so, he is standing next to the golden doors. Anne is there, grown up now. She explains that the Lady has regained her full authority.</p><p>If Joe reaches for the doors, Anne says: "No! Touching them will destroy you." She intones some words in Primal:</p><blockquote><p>"The gates of hell are open night and day; <br /> Smooth the descent, and 
easy is the way: <br /> But to return, and view the cheerful skies, <br /> 
In this the task and mighty labor lies."</p></blockquote><p>And the inscription on the door changes: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" and she bids Joe to touch the door...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ed's simulacrum<br /></strong></span></p><p>The Raven Queen, newly restored to her full power, grabs Ed with her chains. He hears her voice in his mind: "Go now, or your friends will be destroyed." He feels her chains spiritually bind to his arms, and knows he could lash out with them... rend... pull...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The fighting pits</strong></span></p><p>Asmodeus: "I know that I would be wasting your time and ours if I were to send the ordinary denizens of the pit after you. Therefore, I have devised something very special, in honor of your visit." Asmodeus calls forth the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/monsters/abomination.htm#hecatoncheires">Hecatoncheires</a> to destroy them. The crowd roars in response.</p><p>Meanwhile:</p><ul><li>Ed and Joe both come through the portal in opposite directions around the same time.</li><li>Anne guides Joe from the temple to the fighting pits, through the 
streets of Nessus. Due to his awakening, Joe can snuff out the existence of lesser devils. Ed can shred devils with the chains at will.</li></ul><p>Once he arrives, Ed can grab the Dragon Orb, mounted over Asmodeus's ruby throne, and pull it in (no save).</p><p>Or he can grab Asmodeus herself as she is concentrating on aiding Mammon at the Ordered nexus (need to beat her CMD).</p><p>The pits are surrounded by indestructible walls of force, but the chains can go right through, and pull things through, at will. Once inside, Asmodeus cannot escape. Or if the Orb is pulled through, Asmodeus will lower the walls and jump in there herself. Either way, she'll transform into her 13 foot tall form.</p><p>Mephistopheles (secretly Hextor) is in the stands watching, and will make a move at the opportune moment. He makes a speech, when appropriate: "I've been plotting this for thousands of years... if I had known that all I had to do was throw that pretty rock in the pit, this would have been over a lot sooner. To all you denizens of Nessus: submit yourselves to me now, or perish in flames!"</p><p>Meanwhile, Joe can unleash the undead Tarrasque to oppose the Hecatoncheires...</p><p>That leaves the party to battle with Asmodeus, with Mephistopheles throwing in the occasional helping hand to ensure Asmodeus's destruction.</p>      </div>
