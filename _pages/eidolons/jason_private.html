        <p>I'm thinking right now of a rogue, maybe with some finesse fighting stuff, and aspirations towards arcane magic.&nbsp; I would like to get some telepathy with merit points and maybe some very minor shapeshifting stuff, although the latter is not necessary and if either doesn't work well with merit points I'll do it with some magic instead.</p>
<p>Probably half-elf, with halfling for the other half?&nbsp; I'm not sure how that works since there aren't humans.&nbsp; Also, if I end up buying the above mentioned powers with merit points could I be part doppleganger or something similar?&nbsp; Not a big deal, just a thought.</p>      </div>
