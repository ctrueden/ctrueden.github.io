<p><u>(Underlined added by Jeff)</u></p>
<p>Name: Biger OPece (&quot;Bye-jer Oh-pess&quot;)<br />
Race: Warforged<br />
Class: Bard (Emphasis: synergy, boosting...&nbsp; buffomancy)... ((Though this can be changed if desired.))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Backstory</u></p>
<p>Biger was one of the first soulforged made for a purpose other than war.... this was about 150 years ago, though he's not certain of his exact age, because of the gap in his memory.&nbsp; He was built to provide entertainment and be a servant for a wealthy Noble, a gnome named &quot;Thruslik Ralomer&quot;.&nbsp; He was very experimental at the time, though since then, other small soulforged, and other soulforged not built for combat have been constructed.&nbsp; He was built with durability, aesthetics and flexibility both mental and physical in mind.&nbsp; He was in and of himself a work of art.&nbsp; That he could produce yet more art is a true testament to his Designer, the gnome &quot;Yolarlen Budonga&quot;.&nbsp; Yolarlen turned on Biger, and handed him over to thruslik proudly.&nbsp; When Thruslik asked what the crank that was on Biger's back was for, Yolarlen shrugged: &quot;We aren't sure.&nbsp; It wasn't part of the design, but there it is anyway... If you turn it, let us know how it turns out.&nbsp; If you can still talk, of course.&quot;</p>
<p>Thruslik Immediately Started Working biger to the metaphorical bone.&nbsp; While Thruslik Was awake, he demanded the full attention and music of Biger (which wasn't so bad.... Biger truly enjoys playing his Instrument... though he was bothered that he never go so much as a &quot;that was a nice song&quot;.)&nbsp; And while Thruslik Slept, Biger did other chores.&nbsp; Everything from cleaning out small spaces to calculating his Dues and managing the paperwork, he usually had to work at least 4 hours on this, frequently more (Preventing him from shutting down as often or as long as he'd like).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, very occasionally, Thruslik would need to attend days long meetings with other gnomes to discuss strategy, construction, and the like.&nbsp; During these times, Biger would rest and speak with some of his warforged friends.&nbsp; They were built for war, and to pass the time they played tactical games (Similar to Othello, for instance), for they enjoyed conflict as much as Biger enjoyed music.&nbsp; As they played their games, he watched and played his music, especially of the sorts that Thruslik disliked ( haunting, mourning, 'deep' songs).&nbsp; One particular warforged named &quot;Jurlesque&quot; told Biger tales of the battles he'd been in and had a mentor mindset... Biger would frequently rework these tales into songs for Thruslik to enjoy.</p>
<p>In addition, several times, Thruslik needed a message delivered to a high ranking noble in another city, or for rare components to be collected for crafting. During these meetings, Biger was under a lot of pressure to perform well.&nbsp; If his audience was displeased with his message, he had to word it better and play appropriate music.&nbsp; He enjoyed these outings because they were a break from a routine which quite simply bored him.&nbsp; At least most gnomes live an exciting life, and therefore so do their workers... but no... Thruslik was an analytical, cautious man... No exciting explosions or the like in his home, no-sir-ee.&nbsp; This trait caused him to be a bit of an outcast of sorts among other gnomes... and also not only prevented him from turning Biger's crank, but also made him lock it in place.</p>
<p>During one such delivery (In this case, he was to join some adventurer's in withdrawing some adamantine ore from a very large mine which had been neglected for several decades due to its location in the wastelands... the nearby nexus had 'dried up').&nbsp; Now, every time, someone would ask about Biger's crank, and he would always tell them:&nbsp; &quot;I don't know what it does, and neither do the gnomes who made me... so I really suggest you leave it alone.&quot;&nbsp; Now, Most people were reasonable about this, but this adventuring party wanted to see what it did.&nbsp; He was adamant that they not turn it, however, so they eventually gave up.</p>
<p>Well, he thought they did.&nbsp; The group rested in the mines, and the leader of the party, the cleric of Olidammara named &quot;Kolmen Juskol&quot; offered to take first watch.&nbsp; Biger was convinced that he had convinced the group to leave him well enough, alone, so he slept that first watch.</p>
<p>And when he woke up, he was somewhere he had never been (Though it was clearly a sort of wasteland... no Nexuses or ley lines were in sight), it was the middle of the day, the weather was completely different... he was comforted by the fact that what little gear and supplies he had was still with him, but he was shocked to find that the lock on his crank had been removed, and that the crank wasn't in the same position it always was.&nbsp; Although he couldn't reach the crank (And mage hand couldn't turn it anyway... it's part of a living creature), he did later manage to take a spare lock and use mage hand to lock it back into place.</p>
<p>He quickly realized that he was free.&nbsp; Far away from anywhere he had ever known, and with no idea of what day, month, season, or year it was, he felt completely unbound.&nbsp; Until now, his life had been commanded completely by someone else.&nbsp; Only now that he had tasted true freedom, did he realize he would never again be able to stand it.&nbsp; And he swore then and there to do his best to make sure that no one else would be forced to live the life he had, unable to make choices for themselves, though remembering that some people legitamately CHOOSE such a life... and therefore may have it.</p>
<p>And with that vow, he felt a... presence, acknowledging it, seeming pleased.&nbsp; At that moment, he noticed a small nugget of gold lying in the withered, sparse grass.&nbsp; He picked it up curiously, and felt it resonate with him, and he knew that Garl Glittergold had granted him favor.&nbsp; After a day of rolling along, slowly, but happily (hoping he'd find a nexus to recharge, as he suspected he was low), he was attacked by a pair of outcast orcs.&nbsp; He called out for help, and, much to his surprise, a leopard appeared out of nowhere and started tearing apart the orcs.&nbsp; After it had finished, it turned to Biger and said &quot;I'm Wrin, Built by master... brother:...&nbsp; Ride?&quot; Indicating a pocket in its back which was, upon closer examination, clearly artificial. Biger settled into the 'seat' comfortably and grinned as he fit perfectly into it.&nbsp; Wrin ran, far faster than Biger had been.&nbsp; After about 10 hours, they stopped and chatted... Wrin taught biger how to channel the gift Garl had granted him, as well as how to call Wrin, among other things.</p>
<p>Biger himself managed a new trick or two, becoming able to first call a phantasmal horse, then to interpose it with Wrin, to grant it incredible mobility. They continued on at this incredible pace, travelling about 10 hours a day, speaking for four, spending a couple making and breaking camp, and about eight hours of thought and rest, the latter two categories spent alone, as Wrin could only remain for a while.&nbsp; They travelled onward at this incredible pace for three weeks, while Biger became worried... how could he have come this far without recharging?&nbsp; What powerful magic had cast him out here, and just how long had he been there, anyway?&nbsp; But around then, they began to see signs of life, and ley lines.&nbsp; They followed one of these to a small village.</p>
<p>Within the village (of Nomads), he managed to get some basic equipment, using what he had to barter with.&nbsp; He also found out that no one there had so much as -heard of- his hometown or any of the places it had traded with.&nbsp; Now, he knows that its name might have changed, but he simply didn't recognize any of the local geography either, nor did any of the people at the village know.&nbsp; He set out again, willing to leave his past behind for now.&nbsp; And if or when he did manage to find his hometown, he wouldn't be especially eager to go back to it.&nbsp; And for now, he would do what he could to make sure people lived the free, happy lives they deserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Warforged special characteristic:<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p>Instead of the warforged Composite Plating racial feature, Biger is a masterwork bardic instrument capable of producing a variety of sounds. Biger can &quot;play&quot; the instrument&nbsp;(which is also his voicebox)&nbsp;without using his hands, for any of the following Perform types, or simultaneous combinations thereof:&nbsp;keyboard, percussion, wind, string, and sing.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Requirement:&nbsp;Versatile Performer feat at first level (waiving the normal prerequisite of 5 ranks in Perform)</li>
</ul>
<p>Biger's <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/buildingcharacters/characterTraits.htm#slow">Slow</a> trait:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Instead of feet, Biger has treads that roll his box-like body around.</li>
    <li>His movement is halved&nbsp;(15 feet instead of 30 [<u>Or 10 instead of 20, if small]</u>).</li>
    <li>He takes a -8 penalty to Climb, Ride, and Swim skill checks.</li>
    <li>As a standard action during his turn each round, Biger can move up to his speed and run over opponents at least one size category smaller than himself. This attack deals 4d6 bludgeoning damage. A&nbsp;trampled opponent can attempt either an attack of opportunity at a -4 penalty or a Reflex save&nbsp;(DC&nbsp;10 +&nbsp;1/2 Biger's character level&nbsp;+&nbsp;grafted creature's Str modifier)&nbsp;for half damage.</li>
    <li>Cannot be tripped, +2 to defensive CMB when being overrun, quadraped carrying capacity (x1 [no effect] for small, x1.5 for Medium)</li>
    <li>+1 Vitality/level</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Levitate:</strong> Small, efficient Jets can lift him in the air, allowing him to hover and gain altitude. (Cost, 3 mp, +3 mp/5 feet...)</p>
<p><strong>Horizontal movement jets:</strong> While levitating, he can move up to his speed horizontally, paying 1 vitality per foot moved. (Cost: 3 mp)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Biger's Crank<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p><u>While he was unconscious, it was turned (Despite warnings to the contrary).&nbsp; He remained unconscious for some mount of time, and recently woke up again.&nbsp; He doesn't know what has happened in the interventing time, or what turning the crank actually did... he only surmises that it was turned because the locking mechanism on it was disabled at the time he reawoke. (x merit points)</u></p>
<p><u>The Champion of Freedom Variant:&nbsp; Aura of courage (lvl 3) instead works against compulsions, and Aura of Righteousness (lvl 17) then works against fear</u>.&nbsp; <u>Additionally, the Code of Conduct is slightly different, mandating a CG alignment instead of LG.&nbsp; He must respect indvidual liberty, help those in need (If they wouldn't use that assistance of evil ends or the like), and to punish those who threaten or curtail personal liberty, and need not respect legitimate authority, but unless that authority is being abused or overbearing, need not threaten it, either.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Biger's Mount<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p><u>Instead of the standard heavy warhorse (Or warpony?), perhaps an Effigy Leopard (CR=3, compared to a heavy warhorses 2, a light warhorses 1... Warpony's are CR&nbsp;1/2, and Riding dogs are CR 1.&nbsp; This might therefore cost some small amount of merit points).&nbsp; It would progress normally as paladin mounts do, otherwise (Including being intelligent, and probably therefore losing an immunity to mind affecting that effigy creatures usually have, being non-intelligent) (Though the HD inreases are construct HD instead of magical beast HD:&nbsp; (D10 instead of d8, same BAB, 3 bad saves instead of good Fort/Ref)).&nbsp; [The effigy template usually removes all skill points and most feats.. because the creature becomes nonintelligent.&nbsp; How would this work with the intelligence of the mount?]&nbsp; In addition, the Command ability might be altered (To do something similar to constructs or effigies in particular), or kept (And work on great cats, as would typically happen).&nbsp; </u></p>
<p><u>More with the mount:&nbsp; It would not give him the normal penalty to ride checks while Biger was riding the mount.&nbsp; When Biger casts Phantasmal steed, the leopard expands in size, becoming large [long] (Lowering its AC, attack, and stealth checks), gaining temporary hitpoints equal to the normal HP of the phantasmal steed (CL=HP), and gaining the improved movement the phantasmal steed would, and no longer negating the ride penalty for Biger (He doesn't fit quite as securely in this expanded form's slot).&nbsp; When the temporary HP from the spell are gone, OR&nbsp;the spells duration expires, the spell ends.&nbsp; (Basically, this just makes it so that he doesn't need to dismiss his mount in order to use a phantasmal steed.&nbsp; It still carries the other limitations of phantasmal steed... can't be used like this in a small enclosure, for instance).&nbsp; Note, though, that normally phantasmal steeds can't wear barding ((Unless I'm mistaken)), which is a significant difference... so I'd be willing to pay a few more merit points for this slight variation.</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>NPCs [out of date]<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Yolarlen Budonga:</strong> The genius who thought up the idea of testing the effects of withering on Warforged.&nbsp; His motivation for doing so was to hope to create warforged, then stop tapping the Nexuses.&nbsp; In this way, the Technomagic Prophets (TMPs) could exist as a nation seperate from the empire of Ideologues, and remain on good terms with them.&nbsp; He is a gnome (Class; artificer, or wizard[or bard]/maester).</p>
<p><strong>Thruslik Ralomer:</strong> Another gnome, similar to Yolarlen, but with different motivations.&nbsp; He is the master who first concieved the warforged, though this detail has been lost, and he and Yolarlen are now seen as the co-creators.&nbsp; Thruslik Disapproved of Yolarlen's motivation in creating Biger, but wanted more warforged to be made (So that he would become more famous), so he pushed it to the council of domestic development.&nbsp; Upon Biger's Return, he claimed full credit for the idea, and unveiled his reasons for creating him: so that the TMPs could finally infiltrate the empire of Ideologues.&nbsp; Biger could enter the empire, and masquerade as a nonwarforged, thanks to magic, disguise, and practice, and could gather valuable information about their inner workings.</p>
<p><strong>Elatheral Plores:</strong> A Genasi geomancer, he was on the council of domestic development, and disapproved of Biger's creation for multiple reasons (Though he was outvoted). He was probably tainted by the Ideologue, as he believed that renewels and other uses of the nexuses were weakening the earth.&nbsp; He argued that the creation of these warforged was overtaxing the Nexuses. He eventually protested the use of the Nexuses by Refusing to renew, becoming exiled quickly, and withering away shortly after.&nbsp; However, his withering wasn't witnessed, and Upon Biger's return, he arrived at the reunion meeting, looking aged maybe 100 elf years, and having realized the folly of failing to renew before it was too late.&nbsp; Whether or not it exists, his withered, undead self's status is completely unknown.</p>
<p><strong>Qel'ath'lo'nu Ip'fel'nen:</strong> An eladrin runecaster on the council of domestic development, she is convinced that the withering is ubiquitous without renewel.&nbsp; She believes that what happens in the empire of Idealogues is that citizens renew, but are sworn to not admit such.&nbsp; She decided to vote for the creation of Biger, knowing that he would fall to the withering, but -extremely- interested in what sort of undead he would become when he did so.</p>
<p><strong>Biger Koldge:</strong> A result of a Quake (Not that anyone knows that), resulting in a version of Biger whose motivations are more in line with Thruslik's than with Yolarlen's.</p>
<p><strong>Wieu Laorps:</strong> The bardic instructor of Biger during much of his time with the Nomads, teaching him most of what he knows.&nbsp; He is a halfling bard who was fascinated with the warforged, and so gladly trained him in exchange for the ability to study him.&nbsp; He was part of a well off tribe which still had a nexus when Biger left it, and as far as biger knows, he's alive and well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Prior backstory [out of date]<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p>((All times are as Biger remembers them, or remembers them having been told to him, for the events before his forging.))</p>
<p>Some 320 years ago, the first warforged was made.&nbsp; About 20 years later, Yolarlen decided that the TMPs should test whether or not warforged do in fact need to renew... if they didn't they could save a lot of energy, perhaps even not neededing to tap the nexuses at all, as living people were 'phased out'.&nbsp; Thruslik brought this before the domestic council and gained grudging approval, and Yolarlen went to work.</p>
<p>Yolarlen forged &quot;Bringer Of Peace&quot;, who was sent out (After having been brought before the council and imaged) into the wilderness with some basic weapons (His armor having been forged onto him already) and basic training, and was told not to renew or return for 250 years.&nbsp; He was installed with a &quot;final messenger&quot; component, so that, should he die, such would be reported.</p>
<p>During these 250 years, Biger lived variously by himself, among the Nomads, and among other TMP cities.&nbsp; But he never renewed, and he minimized his time among the TMP cities.&nbsp; He learned much of what he knows from the Nomads, including his musical talents.&nbsp; He also aged very rapidly, his mithril body becoming scratched and dented almost of its own free with, and his wooden components stiffening up somewhat.&nbsp; After a while, though, the decay stopped; The wood, though long dead, remained pliable, and the mithral he was made of resisted the extreme corrosion which may have happened had his body been mere steel (Though some letters on his nameplate [on the inside of his 'bicep'] had worn away, resulting in everyone (Including himself) knowing him as Biger OPece.)</p>
<p>After his exile, he returned to the city, to see that little had changed.&nbsp; Indeed, of the five members on the council he had seen, only one had aged significantly... (Though as Biger was later told, this one [Elatheril] had actually been thought as dead or otherwise lost for some time, and Biger suspects that Elatheril may well have been dead, before he was remembered as stumbling back into town after a 4 year self imposed exile.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the other direction, each of the council members remembered only their own motivation for having made him.&nbsp; Though he'd felt entropy before, he felt an enormous quake building up, and tried to sort himself and his mind to remain steady in the face of this drastic change.&nbsp; In a sense, he succeeded.&nbsp; But another Biger suddenly walked in the door, back form -his- 250 year exile:&nbsp; &quot;Biger Koldge&quot;, the mental construct of Thruslik, with a similar story and history as OPece, but a very different motivation:&nbsp; instead of being an emissary of peace, he saw the past years as a way of training for infiltration, and had spent much of his time learning of the Ideologues, rather than the Nomads.&nbsp; In addition, OPece felt another part of his mind and memories becoming splintered and breaking off, but to this day, he has no idea what that was about, as he's not met any other Biger's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two Bigers made their reports, and a rivalry immediately began between the creations of Yolarlen and Thruslik.&nbsp; OPece was determined to show that diplomacy and comraderie were better than spying, betrayal, and war, while Koldge tried to prove the opposite.&nbsp; Though they are often at ends, they respect eachother, and don't simply dismiss the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Years since, OPece has done odd jobs here and there, mastering his crafts, and learning as much as he can, especially about the beliefs of the Ideologues.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Koldge hasn't been seen much in the TMP,&nbsp; spending most of his time among the Ideologues in disguise, trying to learn how they avoid withering and entropy.</p>
