<p>This warforged looks like it should have been scrapped a few centuries ago, as weathermarks scar its body, and the ravages of withering have touched it..&nbsp; Its movements are rather sluggish, it's strength, unimpressive.&nbsp; But it works.&nbsp; Indeed, it works surprisingly well, considering its condition.&nbsp; That it functions at all is a testament to the skill of its creator, and that it seems to have suffered only a slight decrease in capability indicates master craftsmanship.</p> <p>After only a few moments speaking with it, it becomes obvious why it was kept.&nbsp; It manages to sound genuinely interested to whatever you say, while asking for clarification in a polite manner when needed.&nbsp; It is obvious that it remains eager to learn, despite its age, and teaching it never seems a chore so much as a pasttime.&nbsp; It seems to have surprisingly deep understanding of living minds, though it is clearly something... different.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, what one first tends to notice is Biger's unique shape.&nbsp; Some at first assume incorrectley that the two heads which seem connected to the same body are both his, as the lower one only rarely speaks.&nbsp; Those who have heard the lower head speak know that its inflection and thinking is far different. Further examination reveals that there are two actual creatures... the lower one is shaped like a mechanical leopard... &nbsp;This is Wrin, Biger's trusted companion.&nbsp; The upper one is Biger himself, shaped like a modern day tank, with two arms coming out just behind his head.&nbsp; He lacks a neck, his head instead protruding from between the treads , near the front of his body.&nbsp; At the opposite end, there are a pair of cranks, one gray, and one a dull orange.&nbsp; They have several padlocks keeping them in place, and Biger for some reason refuses to allow people to turn the cranks.</p>      </div>
