<p><u><strong>Backstory<br />
</strong></u><br />
Isaline was born in a small town named Hanfield on the edge of Elyrian territory.&nbsp; Hanfield, a small farming town of four hundred, stood upon a small sequestered nexus and was quite unimportant.&nbsp; Scant memories remain of these better times; her father was part elf and her mother a human who was even more striking than Isaline.&nbsp; It was secluded and had not seen an army for thirty years until one winter day when the Vanquisher&rsquo;s horde assaulted the town.&nbsp; Isaline escaped immediate death by having been playing in the fields and was not trapped within the motte and bailey like the majority of the residents.&nbsp; It was not long before her capture by his troops and execution approached.&nbsp; Luckily the Vanquisher&rsquo;s dagger broke when hitting her brow and left a grievous enough wound to be left for dead.&nbsp; The eye was badly damaged and would mend, but it would forever hold a piece of the blade and some of its magic.&nbsp; It was not for a long time that the purpose of destroying Hanfield to break open its nexus became clear to Isaline.&nbsp; With seven other survivors they huddled together against the cold for two days until the Marquis of Elyria and his troops arrived to take the three who still lived to a safer place.</p>
<p>Isaline was taken as a ward of the Marquis Frederick Vanhem and put under the tutelage of his own former teacher Corvidae.&nbsp; Corvidae, an ancient Deva cleric of the Raven Queen, spent three years helping Isaline recover but there would always be a hardness and lack of emotions within her.&nbsp; Coming to terms with the deaths she had seen came first, but Corvidae recognized her as a human and did everything in his power to indoctrinate her into the Raven Queen&rsquo;s teachings.&nbsp; He did not need to press her to do so as she took to the lessons and ideals extremely quickly.&nbsp; Before the age of nine Isaline had already sworn her life to a goddess most Imperials did not know.&nbsp; So at the Marquis&rsquo; holding of Celapelai (one of the oldest estates in the Elyrian noble&rsquo;s park) Isaline recovered her mental faculties and was trained by the best tutors the Marquis could find.&nbsp; The days were spent in lessons with free time split between fencing, riding, and learning old songs on the fiddle.&nbsp; Likewise she was taught about the tenets of Moradin and while it could not supplant the Raven Queen it would shape her beliefs and help push her into the life of a soldier.&nbsp; There was no lack of other people her age, but her status as an outsider and mockery over her scar kept her distant.</p>
<p>The life of a soldier was not easy, but through sheer determination and an utter lack of fear Isaline rose through the ranks.&nbsp; Even then it took over ten years to rise from a footman to commanding an entire battalion of Elyrian troops.&nbsp; She developed a reputation as a sound strategist and a skilled fighter after leading a twenty man recapture of Forc»á Rive, a major fort, from over ten times that number of orcs and a brilliant vanguard action at Porte de Glacon.&nbsp; A year before being assigned to Gustav Brehem&rsquo;s cradle guard Isaline gave birth to her daughter Sophia.&nbsp; The father Seth Balderossa, an Eladrin Outrider of Elyria, perished in an assault on a Cult of Orcus only two years later.&nbsp; Sophia was raised at Celapelai and rarely was Isaline free from her duty guarding the Marquis&rsquo; heir to spend more than one day a week together.&nbsp; The Cradle Guard watched Gustav for sixteen years while enduring three assassination attempts.&nbsp; The final one was a significant attack made by a Lord Gabrieli, the recently deposed chamberlain of the kingdom, with silent support of other foes of the Marquis managed to attack the palace and kill the old Marquis.&nbsp; Isaline fought a masked being in ornate black plate to a standstill before reinforcements finally arrived and drove off the remaining assassins.&nbsp; Although unable to gather sufficient evidence it was Soren van Wagram, Isaline has sworn vengeance against the dwarf but cannot move until the opportunity presents itself.&nbsp; Only Isaline and one other of the original guard survived until Gustav finally had his coronation ceremony.</p>
<p>Promoted to the Third (of Seven) Outriders by the new Marquis, Isaline received a beautifully crafted suit of Outrider Armor and one of the swords of the old Marquis (the Long Sword known as the Ardent Blade).&nbsp; Her most impressive deed was just about a month ago in a series of battles to capture a nexus at the fortress now called Eloyes.&nbsp; One of the largest battles in recent years; the entire Protectorate under Elyria massed close to forty thousand soldiers to take a series of seven mountain and river forts guarding the passes to the former free city of Llanelli (which prior to a massive horde attack under the Vanquisher had been amongst the five biggest free cities).&nbsp; Several attempts by the nomads and displaced citizens backed by prophet mercenaries had already failed when the Elyrian led army blocked all the paths and began a long siege.&nbsp; Gustav Brehem opted to use Heaven&rsquo;s Door four times in the first two weeks; obliterating three forts and causing a rockslide that buried a fourth.&nbsp; Unable to approach or even aim at the remaining three, a more conventional week long siege took two more.&nbsp; The final fort, known as the Nest of Crows for the slaughter that often occurred on two narrow approaches, still remained in the hands of an ogre chieftain.&nbsp; For a week smaller siege engines in the passes hammered at the fort to moderate effect as Elyrian troops waited.&nbsp; With one gate and one wall breached a large scale assault began but was repulsed twice by heavy arrow fire and traps.&nbsp; A third attempt with the Outriders leading both attacks reached the walls and began the arduous task of clearing the fort.&nbsp; Finally Isaline and the Second Outrider Germaine De&rsquo;Rante engaged the chieftain hoping to break the hordes spirit.&nbsp; The ogre was beyond them both, no matter how many strikes they landed it did not fall and the Outriders were losing ground quickly when Germaine was shot in the back by one of the ogre&rsquo;s bodyguards.&nbsp; Without thinking Isaline dove between Germaine and the ogre&rsquo;s battleaxe; blocking it once (which broke her shoulder and arm) and then having it buried in her shoulder on the second swing which gave her one moment to strike the ogre&rsquo;s head from its shoulders.&nbsp; Collapsing from the wound, Isaline woke after three days of dreaming of a bird cawing and shadowy shapes.&nbsp; She was back in one of the hospital camps with a strange new sensation; the thoughts of an unknown creature were at the edge of her mind and clenched in her left hand several black feathers.&nbsp; The city had been retaken and the Elyrian troops were busy rebuilding the forts in their newest claimed territory and those who had seen Isaline fight would remember and build her reputation as an elite soldier.&nbsp; Her reputation grew more fearsome as Isaline and her new mount returned to active duty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><span style="font-weight: bold">Bonded</span></u><u><strong> mount<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/nightmare.htm">nightmare</a>, but change <em>astral projection</em> and <em>etherealness</em> to <em>shadow walk</em> with rider 1/day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>NPCs<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>The Vanquisher: </strong>A flawless human looking leader of a horde past the eastern edge of Elyria&rsquo;s control.&nbsp; Wears a daunting skull helm that disguises his features for it is said that none who have seen his face lived to speak about it.&nbsp; A very skilled geomancer specializes in sensing danger and predicting attacks on his horde.&nbsp; Has been known as a foe of all peoples for over fifty years.&nbsp; Rumors abound of supernatural or greater powers he possesses to have lived and survived for so long and an ability to distill nexus energy into something else.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Marquises of Elyria:</strong> Both dragonborn rulers of Elyria and its protectorate.&nbsp; The old Marquis Frederick Vanhem took Isaline in and gave her anything she asked for.&nbsp; Always watched from afar as it would have caused issues if he had appeared to be too close to a human orphan.&nbsp; A kind lord who cared deeply for his people, his life was ended by an assassination orchestrated by the Duke of Blackdale.&nbsp; Gustav Brehem (cleric) is now the Marquis and is very much his father&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; Has complete trust in Isaline and can rely on her in any situation.&nbsp; Wants to expand Elyria and at least gain a seat on the Ideologue Council in the near future.&nbsp; Would like to eliminate the Duke of Blackdale in revenge, but risks civil war in the protectorate if he cannot gather sufficient proof first.&nbsp; The Marquis possess at least two known relics; the family blade Schiavona and the massive magical war cannon somewhat ironically named Heaven&rsquo;s Door.</p>
<p><strong>Corvidae:</strong> An ancient deva cleric of the Raven Queen.&nbsp; Tutored both Marquis Frederick and at least three of his ancestors.&nbsp; Has been an important neutral figure throughout the Ideologues working for any who will pay him in magic items.&nbsp; Has been missing for about five years.&nbsp; The Marquis has placed a reward for information that leads to finding him and Isaline would love to be reunited with her former teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Soren van Wagram:</strong> A noble dwarf from Blackdale, a city that has been subservient to Elyria for around a century, who is intent on building his power base and challenging the Marquis of Elyria for control of the other protectorates.&nbsp; By all accounts is the heir of the last Duke of Blackdale, dating back around 115 years, and his possession of the ancient Aefelthirk&rsquo;s Plate armor backs up his claim.&nbsp; Responsible for the assassination Marquis Frederick and at least one attempt on the infant Gustav.&nbsp; Lacks the manpower and allies that Elyria could summon in open war so he works mainly behind the scenes attempting to weaken Gustav&rsquo;s power before openly making a challenge.&nbsp; It is unknown what lengths and what allies he would be willing to accept in order to further his plans.</p>
<p><strong>Sophia de Celapelai:</strong> Nineteen year old half-eladrin daughter of Isaline.&nbsp; A talented fighter and duelist who is currently on a roundabout training with various masters throughout Ideologue territory and visiting the big cities.&nbsp; The spitting image of her mother, minus the scars and gray hair.&nbsp; Never particularly close to her mother, but they respect each other deeply and both would love for Sophia to become an Outrider before Isaline retires or dies.&nbsp; Perhaps not as loyal to Elyria as her mother, but was a staunch follower of Moradin who would not lightly betray her oaths.&nbsp; Was gifted with the sword Lily Blossom by Gustav upon her leaving a year and a half ago.</p>

<br />
&bull; How would you like to die?&nbsp; <br />
