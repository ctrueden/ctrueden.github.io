<p>My name is Isaline de Celapelai and I am dying. Each day I inch closer to my own demise, but withering or refreshing are of no concern any longer. I have accepted my fate, to be truly mortal in a world of &quot;immortals.&quot; I fear nothing and all I require is provided for by my duty to my lord.&nbsp; For twenty-nine years I have served the Marquises of Elyria; first as a soldier and officer, a Cradle Guard to the young Marquis Gustav Brehem, and lastly as the Third Outrider of Elyria.&nbsp; My story lacks the great deeds and heraldry of heroes, but it will be recorded nonetheless.</p> <p>By my estimation I was born years ago in a town no one remembers. We were at the edge of Elyrian control and thusly protected by the Ideologues work as well. I remember loving the wild strawberries I could find just outside of town, but I cannot recall my parents' faces. This idyllic life was shattered while I was still growing when the Vanquisher and his horde came. I was lucky to be outside the town and was not immediately slain or devoured by orcs, trolls, and horrible undead. I could not hide and soon was captured and brought before him. With his undead sated and the living monsters carrying every possession they could find the Vanquisher simply executed the remaining survivors. I was last in line and paralyzed by his magic as he killed the others before finally reaching me. His horrible skull helmet leered close to my face and through it I gazed upon his features. He struck my face with his blade and had it not been for my thick skull cracking the edge I would have died rather than simply losing my right eye. Passing out from the pain and loss of blood I must have been left for dead until the old Marquis Frederick Vanhem and his men found me. With three other survivors I was taken back to Elyria to recover.</p> <p>The next months were a blur as I was taken as a ward of the Marquis and recovered physically. It would take three years under the tutelage of Corvidae, an ancient deva cleric of a forgotten god, before I was willing and able to speak again. His teachings helped to accept the things I had seen and embrace the dangers of life while not fearing death. Despite my recovery he could do nothing to curb my hatred of undead and my distaste for using the powers of the nexuses to refresh. For years I grew up in a city full of diverse peoples, but never saw met another person quite like me. Truly a strange coincidence as Elyria leads a large protectorate of just over twenty towns and cities. As an Ideologue city I was heavily influenced by the teachings of loyalty and dedication espoused by Moradin and to a much lesser degree by Bahamut. The Marquis Frederick Vanhem took care of almost any need, but he always had much more important work and simply watched from afar. When I reached the age of enlistment I took the vow of loyalty and service to Elyria as a paladin. Never will I forgot or break my vow to the Marquis: &quot;By my life or death I shall never break the trust of my Lord, betray his orders, or endanger Elyria.&quot; For ten years I rose through the ranks from a trooper to battalion commander while Elyria expanded its control and drove the hordes back mile after mile.</p> <p>Then one of the greatest events in my life occurred, the birth of Frederick&rsquo;s son Gustav Brehem. The old Marquis rewarded my loyalty and service by choosing me as one of twelve Cradle Guards. For eight hours every day four of us would stand guard against any threat. Three attempts were made on his life in those sixteen years, including the one that took the life of Frederick. While nothing could be proven I remain sure it was the Duke of Blackdale, Soren van Wagram. One day I hope to find evidence of his treacherous plots and see that foul dwarf hang from a gallows in Celestine Gardens. It was all worth it on the day Gustav first sat on the throne for his coronation and the people looked proudly upon their young dragonborn ruler. I was quickly promoted to the Outriders of Elyria, the most elite warriors and military leaders of our forces. Being given the ceremonial armor of an Outrider was perhaps the happiest day of my life; while the personal glory was not above enjoying it could not compare to the compliments my lord bestowed upon me. Thus I have served from the front these last three years and return to Elyria for my lord&rsquo;s wedding ceremony this coming month. Rumors abound amongst the other officers that the Marquis has a new plan to discuss with the Outriders upon our return.</p> <p>Isaline is marked with a fair number of scars, most noticeably the one causing her nickname of &quot;Old One Eye.&quot; Shoulder length blond hair is broken up by spots of gray that matches her cold gray eye. A skilled cavalier she wears lighter armor than the average foot soldier, a common trend amongst the Outriders. She has the appearance of someone who has withered to a human age in the late forties.<u><strong><br /> </strong></u></p>      </div>
