        <p><strong>Egorin: Master of the Fist of Heaven</strong></p>
<p>Grandmaster Egorin is a dragonborn of quiet, graceful bearing. His scales are of a silvery-platinum sheen, and he bears a set of long draconic whiskers. Since Za'rhan's latest cycle, Egorin has been his mentor, both in the martial arts and the idealogue's philosophy. While maintainting a rigid sense of dicipline, Egorin speaks with a soft manner, encouraging the budding strengths of his students, rather than dwelling on their shortcomings. His insights are apt, his advice inspiring. From time to time the question has been raised as to why he does not become a leader of soldiers, leaving a senior student in charge of his diciples. His answers to this are rarely direct, choosing often to respond with another question.</p>
<p>He maintains that a broadening of the mind as well as a strengthening of the body is essential to true mastery, and often sets his students about strange, seemingly unrelated tasks, in effort to aid them in obliquely revealing the truth of his lesson, and expanding their ability to more completely master the pursuit of The Way. While Egorin espouses that no truth should be ignored, and one should never close thier mind to the revelation therof, he has historically discouraged Za'rhan from exploring the memories of his past incarnations. The reason for his insistance was never made clear, but after the incident with the acolyte of the Hell Fist, Egorin repealed his earlier decision, telling Za'rhan that his journey for those truths could no longer wait. It was in part at Egorin's behest that Za'rhan left Imperial territory, and began his quest.</p>

<p><strong>Beldwin Jarlegg: Imperial Captain</strong></p>
<p>Captain Jarlegg, or Beld among friends, is as loyal a Dwarf as one can hope to meet. His service to the empire has been exemplary, many would say inspired. He is a powerful personal combatant as well as an accomplished commander, and while his tactics have been criticized at times as conservative, even ponderous, his objectives are almost always achieved, with a minimal loss of life. It was under Beld whom Za'Rhan first served as a defender of the Empire. The two became remarkably fast friends, and Za'rhan soon learned that while a stalwart soldier, Beld held a profound respect for life, including his opponents. He spoke with Za'rhan about how he wished for a world that saw former enemies eating at his table, all united under the protections of Imperial blessings. Za'Rhan holds Beld in great esteem, and deeply respects his judement.</p>
<p>Za'rhan did not inform Beld of his exodus from the Empire. While he knows that Beld holds him as member of his own family, his dissapointment would have been too great for Za'rhan to bear should he dissaprove. It is unknown if upon meeting again, Beld would try to convince him to return, or support him in his journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hessia Jarlegg: Senior Student</strong></p>
<p>Beld's Daughter, Hessia, has proven to be an exceptionally talented and dedicated student of the Heaven Fist. When she first joined she was little more than a child, and struggling under the weight of her desire to make her father proud. Za'hren became her mentor. He worked patiently with her, Reinforcing Egorin's teachings, and teaching her to master her own personal strentghs. She takes after her father's sense of kinship, and quickly forged a bond with her teacher. She is both strong willed, and occasionally headstrong, but her dicipline has been made clear by the results of her training. She has taken Many of Master Egorin's lessons deeply to heart, and maintains an inquisitive perpective about the world, rarely accepting something as truth unless it has been explained to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>Originally, Hessia was determined to join Za'rhan on his journey, but he forbid it. They argued for some time, but finally she agreed to wait until Egorin determined her training was complete. It is likely Hessia has pursued that goal with renewed vigor, but the subject may not have been dropped as easily as Za'rhan has been led to believe.</p>

<p><strong>Alyssa Tanner: Proprietor of The Sad Owl</strong></p>
<p>Alyssa has been the owner of the Sad Owl Tavern for some time. Near a large farming community and along a great trade road, Alyssa does a comfortable business, nearly year-round. Outside the jurisdiction of any particualar land, the Sad Owl has been rumored to be a place for various trade in otherwise regulated goods and services.</p>
<p>Alyssa herself is a somewhat wiry halfling woman, her near midnight hair kept bundled and out of the way. After being waylaid by brigands during a severe storm, Za'rhan was sheltered in the Sad Owl, offering to work off his debt. He helped repair the storm damage, and learned that the same group that had attacked him on the road had threatened both travelers and the local famers before. Beyond that, they regularly came demanding a share of the crop, keeping them in a state of perpetual poverty. Alyssa had apparantly tried to hire mercenaries in the past to clear them out, but had never met with success. Za'rhan sympathized with this plight, and offered to aid her. His method however, was to organize the local farmers, and teach them the fundamentals of combat.</p>
<p>With Alyssa's aid, they organized a militia and a defense strategy, overwhelming the unprepared bandits with their opposition.</p>
<p>Alyssa maintains the Sad Owl, which sevres as a point for Za'rhan to rest, should his jouorney take him near it again.</p>

<p><strong>Mysterious Ally: Student of the Fist of Hell</strong></p>
<p>Za'rhan knows little about this shrouded figure, but on the fateful day he/she came and helped defend the nexus, memories began to awaken in Za'rhan. The dicipline of the Hell Fist no longer buried in Zah'rhan's mind, he seeks this figure out, hoping to learn the meaning of the Hell Fist's secrets, as well as the reason they came to aid the guardians of the nexus.</p>      </div>
