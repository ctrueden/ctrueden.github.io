Alpha was rebuilt and upgraded, and at the whims of their creators they faced each other again,with Beta's loss, then with a further rematch Beta again prevailed.&nbsp; This cycle continued many times until the gnomes noticed a lag in Beta's growth.&nbsp; He had reached a block in his development, a flaw in the design.&nbsp; Beta simply stopped learning, with Alpha emerging victorious time and time again.&nbsp; And so the Gnomes struggled to find a new approach.</p> <p>While they poured over the design schematics, circuit diagrams and bickered over the details, an unexpected solution presented itself in the form of a strange elf who visited their lab.&nbsp; Introducing herself as only Myl os Val, she offered her services as a trainer for Beta, on the only condition that her lessons be uninterrupted.&nbsp; Seeing Beta was being considered a failure already, the gnomes readily agreed, willing to try just about anything &quot;For Science!&quot;</p> <p>During the first lesson the teacher instructed him to defend himself.&nbsp; For a solid hour she beat upon the metal man with her bare hands, his attempts to attack back being utterly futile, and he focused only on getting out of the way of her hammering attacks.&nbsp; Her hands bleeding, and his metal armor cracked and ruined, his frame bent in numerous places, she instructed him to discard the weapons and armor and defend himself again.&nbsp; Seeming not to understand the instructions, Beta followed them anyway, standing awkwardly in front of his sadistic instructor.&nbsp; This time when the attacks came, Beta began to rely on simply not being in their way, finding that at least the weapons and armor weren't slowing him down.&nbsp; Still, he was unable to attack and spent most of the time evading the harsh attentions of his insane teacher.&nbsp; At the end of the hour, the teacher's hands now bruised and bleeding in several locations, simply smiled, the wounds healing on their own accord as she explained: &quot;Those&quot; she gestured to the crumpled pieces of armor and weapons he had used to little effect for the first hour &quot;are crutches.&nbsp; They slow you down, they make you rely on them, make you unable to act without them, and they are holding you back.&nbsp; They did you little good when facing an unarmed woman of half your weight, wearing nothing more then robes.&nbsp; You are all that you need to fight and fight well.&nbsp; And with my help, you will come to realize this.&quot;</p> <p>The lessons continued from there.&nbsp; In the mornings he would do chores around the lab on her instructions, exactly as she instructed.&nbsp; In the afternoons she would pummel him without mercy, and in the evenings, after he cleaned up the mess she made, and after the Gnomes had repaired him, she would lecture him on obscure riddles and logic puzzles.&nbsp; Soon, Beta began to improve.&nbsp; The pummeling sessions became a little less one sided, as every so often he'd be able to throw a punch or kick her way, and later he even managed to do so without her tossing him through a wall.&nbsp; The gnomes watched all of this, and despite their occasional outbursts of impatience and outrage, Myl os Val reminded them of her price, and they found themselves grumbling quietly in the corner, being ultimately unwilling to openly confront the &quot;bizarre little elf woman.&quot;</p> <p>After a couple of months, she announced that Beta was ready to face Alpha again.&nbsp; Beta stepped into the ring unarmed and un-armored, with Alpha towering over him, well over half again his height, crackling with the raw power the Gnomes had crammed into him.&nbsp; The Gnomes looked on, taking bets with their friends for how long it would take for Beta to be disabled this time.&nbsp; And before the start bell had died down, the fight was over, but much to his creator's surprise it was with Beta victorious.&nbsp; They were ecstatic (despite having lost a substantial amount of money to the teacher, who was the only one to predict the victory), and they were back in business.&nbsp;</p> <p>Alpha and Beta resumed their regular matches, with victories being traded back and forth, with Beta's teacher continuing to give him lessons, win or loose in the interim.&nbsp; Then one night, fully a year after she first appeared to the gnomes in the lab, Myl os Val gave Beta a gift, something now his and can never be taken away, a name:&nbsp; Eidylol Pes.&nbsp; With that gift and a single kiss on his metal forehead, Myl os Val disappeared, and hasn't been seen since.</p> <p><u><strong>Backstory - mapping the nexuses<br /> </strong></u></p> <p>The next day, the city magistrate approached the gnomes with a request.&nbsp; He was about to send out a three-person expedition out of the city on a task of some importance, and he needed two capable warforged to act as escorts.&nbsp; The gnomes, having admittedly grown bored with the constant dueling of Alpha and Beta, and eager to try them out &quot;in the field&quot; readily agreed to send their experiments out into wilds as an escort.&nbsp; The three traveled for a full year before the leader of the expedition, one Sadine La&rsquo;Nadriel diseapeared without a trace during a particularly powerful set of tremors while the group was between nexi.&nbsp;</p> <p>The two waited for as long as they dared to, in hopes that the woman they had been protecting for a year or so was on her way.&nbsp; After the second week however they were forced to head back to the last nexus or run the risk of powering down in the middle of nowhere with a low probability of recovery.&nbsp; Once there, it was decided that Alpha would follow protocol and return to the city with a copy of all the data that had already been collected.&nbsp; Beta, now referring to himself as Ed (on the request of Sadine, who found Eidylol Pes to be too much of a mouthful) continued on, both in search of Sadine and to continue making her map.&nbsp; Two months into his solo journey, Ed encountered a merchant by the name of Max, who sought to claim Ed as salvage and sell him to the highest bidder as high quality warforged were scarce this far away from technoprophet holdings and he stood to make a fortune off such a find.&nbsp; Ed recognized Max for what he was more or less immediately, as Max behaved towards him in a similar way to that of Ed&rsquo;s creators, that Ed was at best a form of moving furniture.&nbsp; But Ed also saw in Max an opportunity, as Max was obviously versed in a number of languages, most notably the more local dialects, while Ed knew none, and was making do with hand gestures for the better part of the previous month.&nbsp; Max of course was quickly persuaded to desist in his somewhat short sighted schemes when Ed refused to put on the slave collar and then proceeded to toss the caravan&rsquo;s head of security (Jafik, a half orc barbarian) half way up a tree without so much as batting an eye. The arrangement was simple, Max would enjoy the benefits of a discretely armed guard, and Ed would have a language tutor.&nbsp; When Ed finished learning all that he needed to know, he followed Max to the nearest trading post and continued on with his own mission alone, which he&rsquo;s been doing since.</p> <p><u><strong>Physical description<br /> </strong></u></p> <p>Ed isn&rsquo;t what one would consider your standard combat warforged.&nbsp; When he was built he was designed to, at least in terms of body mechanics, resemble an organic being as closely as possible.&nbsp; This was, in theory, to allow the Gnomes who built him to slap on whatever weapons and armor already available so they could try out the latest improvements they&rsquo;ve made to Alpha on a skilled but otherwise &ldquo;flesh and blood&rdquo; opponent, without the added mess of needing to find &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; to get crushed without mercy.&nbsp; As a result his body proportions are largely humanoid, with his frame built to be slender so as not to get into the way of the armor.&nbsp; His outer frame is a pale near white.&nbsp; His face has a passing resemblance to elven or eladrin features, and his eyes are semi reflective black orbs.&nbsp; His mouth moves when he talks, though there&rsquo;s a slight delay between what was said and the movements normally associated with making the sound.&nbsp; The motion is purely cosmetic as the Gnomes were becoming unnerved by his talking without his lips moving, but they never cared enough to get the timing down perfectly as that wasn&rsquo;t really a priority (hence a -2 to charisma).&nbsp; Typically he wears loose fitting cloth robes that cover his limbs and torso, keeping the worst of the bad weather from affecting his relatively vulnerable articulating joints.&nbsp; When he moves he does so with the expected machinelike precision, but with a subtle grace observable to the keenly perceptive implying that he&rsquo;s more then just a humanoid servant.</p> <p>What makes Ed truly remarkable however isn't his body exactly, but that he's been able to surpass the capabilities of that body in new and ever increasingly complex ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, when he was first created, his hands and arms always seemed to tremble slightly.&nbsp; No matter what the Gnomes did to try and fix the problem, it was always there, so despite repeated attempts to iron it out they just gave up on it.&nbsp; During his training however, Ed was able to learn to not only cease the tremors of his limbs, but also to control them, causing his hands to vibrate with increasing speed and strength more or less at will.&nbsp; During the first fight with Alpha after his training, he was able to use these vibrations to resonate within Alpha and damage a critical component, causing Alpha to power down seemingly with just one (albeit solid) hit.</p> <p>That Beta was capable of such a feat is impressive, that he was able to figure out how to without outside assistance is remarkable, and that no one knows how he's doing so is down right creepy.</p> <p><u><strong>NPCs<br /> </strong></u></p> <p><strong>Myl os Val</strong> (Sound of Rain [Elven]) (Lawful good): In another version of history, the same two Gnomes had created Beta two years earlier.&nbsp; In that version of reality, for reasons that were briefly a mystery and source of distress to Beta&rsquo;s creators, the warforged had gone rogue and went on a killing spree, which was only ended several weeks later by a pair of elves, one ranger and one monk, who had finally tracked it down.&nbsp; The ensuing battle however cost the ranger his life, leaving his mate, the monk, to mourn his loss and (understandably) allow herself to be swept away by the next change in the flow.&nbsp; While she got her bearings in the new reality, she came across a lab similar to the one that created Beta in the first place, and out of a sense of morbid curiosity she snuck inside to have a look.&nbsp; To her horror she found another Beta, sitting alone in a room, flexing a battered arm and staring at it blankly.&nbsp; She watched as it was ordered out of the room, donned armor and armed, and then thoroughly thrashed by Alpha&rsquo;s attacks.&nbsp; She watched as the Gnomes put it back together, cursing and swearing, calling it a disappointment, how they were sure they had worked out all the kinks this time, and how this &ldquo;uncooperative piece of trash&rdquo; was getting them nowhere.&nbsp; She found herself understanding a little more about the creature she had lost her mate to those months ago.&nbsp; She decided that instead of destroying the creature, as was her initial intent, she would fix it, as she already knew the answer the gnomes were trying so hard to uncover; it didn&rsquo;t have a reason to fight.</p> <p>The gnomes were surprisingly easy to convince at first.&nbsp; They had apparently begun to doubt their ability so salvage their troublesome creation, and were at this point willing to try just about anything.&nbsp; Their enthusiasm on the new approach faded however when they began to understand its nature. But it didn&rsquo;t matter, the deal had been struck, and it was binding.&nbsp; She taught her new disciple many things, more then just how to really fight, but the why.&nbsp; She instilled in the creature of her nightmares the desire to improve itself, not just through combat but through all experience.&nbsp; She gave it a purpose, a reason to exist, a reason to fight, and a reason to win, tempered by the understanding of knowing to look for a way to win without fighting.&nbsp; Her pupil learned quickly.&nbsp; He would have done well in her school, and could have eventually made even her sufu proud.&nbsp; And on the first day of his return to the trial grounds, she felt pride even before the fight began, growing only more so when her student lay his rival low with a single telling blow.&nbsp; Not only had her student surpassed the obstacle before it, but it had done so with a technique entirely its own.&nbsp; Only her eyes could detect the flicker of motion of Beta&rsquo;s hands before it struck Alpha&rsquo;s torso.&nbsp; Only her ears could hear the peal of Alpha&rsquo;s hull, the dull tone made by the shaking of her student&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; This was a trick it had taught itself.</p> <p>The trials continued, and win or loose she continued to train her student.&nbsp; She was always pushing, always keeping him close to the limit of his abilities to keep up, but never so far as to push him over the edge.&nbsp; She was always strict, always disciplining, but never abusive.&nbsp; She gave him curt praise for his successes and stern corrections for when he erred.&nbsp; And in the end, fully one year after she began, she had taught him all that she could.&nbsp; She gave him his name as her master had done with her many years before, and left.</p> <p><strong>Sadine La&rsquo;nadril</strong> [Eladrin] (Chaotic good): The daughter of the city, Sadine has had a fascination with the workings of the ley-lines ever since she first learned of their effects on living beings and their reliance on them.&nbsp; One property that has always been of interest has been their relative (by comparison to everything else) stability, that regardless of whatever the flow may change, the nexuses were always more or less where they were last.&nbsp; For years she searched through the records in the research libraries, always she found theories but never concrete answers.&nbsp; And after she had been through the collections to the point of exhaustion she still found her thirst for knowledge on the subject unsatisfied.&nbsp; So she began her own research, performing what tests she could to the nexus within her city before expanding her experiments to other nexi within her factions domains.&nbsp; She even went as far as to subject herself to a change of the flow, both to take measurements during the transition and to compare the data from parallel nexi.&nbsp; Most recently she decided to take a different approach, and travel to all the nexi she could possibly reach, so she could not only make an accurate map of all of their positions, but to take measurements from each one.</p> <p>After a couple of years of appeals, the city magistrate relented and approved the grant money needed to set out on one such expedition, on the condition that his daughter take with her two armed body guards.&nbsp; And so the magistrate commissioned the gnomes to either construct or produce two of their higher quality specimens to guard the researcher on her field trip.&nbsp; With Alpha and Beta (who she ended up calling Ed) in tow, Sadine set off to see the world.</p> <p>Their travels were largely uneventful, the larger of the two warforged acting as a significant deterrent for opportunistic bandits, slavers and the like, and generally the locals found her boundlessly cheery disposition to be tolerable enough not to give her any serious trouble, even being willing to help her on her way on more then one occasion.&nbsp; If it weren&rsquo;t for the tremors a year later sweeping her away from her companions, she&rsquo;s sure the expedition would be going on without a hitch, but now she&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s problem.</p> <p><strong>Zanzibarianaster</strong> and <strong>Mo</strong> (actually Mo&rsquo;s name is un-pronounceably long to non gnomes, so this is what the rest of the world has settled on, whether he likes it or not) [gnomes] (Who the **** knows what their alignments are):&nbsp; The twins have been making warforged for as long as anyone can remember, at least as long as it&rsquo;s been since anyone&rsquo;s been able to tell the two apart with any level of reliability.&nbsp; So when they set off to create yet another &ldquo;unstoppable killing machine the likes of which the world had never seen!!&rdquo; those within earshot knew they meant it.&nbsp; With their reputations on the line, the two gnomes decided upon a novel approach to augment their age-old technique.&nbsp; They would make for their creation a training dummy that was able to learn, adapt and exploit any weakness that it could find, allowing the gnomes to trouble shoot these problems before their creation was released on the field of battle.&nbsp; And so they created Alpha and Beta, and turned them loose upon each other.&nbsp;</p> <p>From their battles the gnomes got their much-desired data, being able to improve upon Alpha, and simply repairing Beta each time.&nbsp; The mismatching of the battles were never a concern to them, though the speed at which Beta was able to keep pace with Alpha did cause them some measure of annoyance.&nbsp; How was their creation going to look when a poorly equipped humanoid model with a slightly bigger brain was able to bring it down half the time?&nbsp; Regardless they were happy to take the feedback from the combat data.</p> <p>All was going well until about a months after the trials began, when Beta apparently began loosing every battle.&nbsp; At first they thought they had reached the pinnacle of creation, and therefore had succeeded at their great task, but something didn&rsquo;t feel right.&nbsp; Alpha still seemed unfinished, and so they came to the conclusion that the problem was Beta.&nbsp; They tried everything.&nbsp; They rebuilt his brain twice, checked his power distribution nodes, reinforced stress fractures in his frame, hells they even tried saying nice things to it once or twice, but they couldn&rsquo;t get it to last more then a couple of seconds in the ring.&nbsp; And on the night where their last nerve was finally about to snap, an elven woman wearing simple robes and a stern expression approached them, offering her services.&nbsp; Not knowing who she was, where she was from, nor caring overmuch why she was interested, they readily agreed.&nbsp; Beta would be someone else&rsquo;s problem, and if the project failed they could blame it on someone else.&nbsp; The terms were actually favorable to them, as they could easily say that they couldn&rsquo;t make any proper attempts to correct the repairs being made on their creation, as to do so would be a violation of the contract.</p> <p>But when the training began, their attitudes changed.&nbsp; Weapons and armor&hellip; crutches?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s absurd!&nbsp; Holding him back?&nbsp; Against Alpha?&nbsp; Ludicrous!&nbsp;&nbsp; Unarmed and unarmored Beta wouldn&rsquo;t last two seconds against their greatest creation ever!&nbsp; And so they voiced their objection, threatening to discontinue this farce if she didn&rsquo;t start making sense, and fast!&nbsp; But, as she calmly pointed out, a deal is a deal, and the gnomes would just have to put up with things being done her way, unless the Gnomes want the magistrate to know that they needed help making their greatest creation work.&nbsp; And so they watched as the teacher taught their training dummy, as she spoke to it, as she beat upon it with her fists, as she made it clean the floors in the kitchen using only its toes.&nbsp; They watched two months later as Beta, scrawny without his plate mail and spear faced off against their unstoppable dreadnought.&nbsp; They sniggered openly, placing bets with their guests, who had come to watch the spectacle with renewed interest, on the duration of the &lsquo;fight&rsquo;.&nbsp; Their jaws hit the banister in unison as Alpha fell to its knees from one punch.&nbsp; ONE!&nbsp; Helpless they were when the teacher took her winnings from the betting pool.&nbsp; But she delivered on her promise, and agreed to stay on, and the grudgingly appreciative gnomes resumed the trials after having to fasten a power distributor that had come loose during the fight.</p> <p>10 months later, the gnomes were given an opportunity to prove their claims of Alpha&rsquo;s supremacy.&nbsp; The Magistrate had come, asking them to send their two best warforged to guard his daughter on some map-making expedition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your lordship, all that your daughter requires is Alpha&rdquo; they claimed, but the Magistrate insisted on two.&nbsp; Given that Beta was taking up space anyway, and that the insane elf had finally left (without warning no less), they sent both of their creations to act as armed escort, eagerly awaiting hearing tales how their invincible creation saved the Magistrates daughter, and cashing in on the favors of a relieved and grateful father.</p> <p><strong>Experiment #357001-Alpha</strong> (true neutral): Alpha was what one may call a very traditional combat form warforged.&nbsp; It was designed from the beginning to be unsubtle, unstoppable, and uncompromising.&nbsp; At first the combat adaptations were comparatively minor, an oversized spike covered gauntlet here, a built in light ballista there, making it a respectable addition to any military unit as medium infantry.&nbsp; However then began the sparing matches between it and Beta.&nbsp; The first match was a clear win for Alpha, but in the rematch after Beta was rebuilt, Alpha would loose.&nbsp; Each time Alpha lost, the gnomes would haul the scrap iron back into the machine shop, pour over the components, isolate the problem areas and rebuild a stronger version of Alpha for testing.&nbsp; After each set of improvements, Alpha would win the match handily, with the rematch going to Beta after a lengthy competition. The self-imposed arms race would continue through many generations, with only Alpha&rsquo;s core personality module remaining as a constant.&nbsp; Alpha however never felt malice towards Beta (though its doubtful this would even be possible for Alpha's 'personality'), it was simply understood that through fighting each other, they would both become more powerful and more capable, just through different methods.&nbsp;&nbsp; It never occurred to the metal behemoth that Beta&rsquo;s creation was solely to act as a trouble-shooter for Alpha&rsquo;s own design flaws.</p> <p>But when Beta started consistently loosing, Alpha felt despair.&nbsp; If Beta couldn&rsquo;t beat Alpha anymore then Alpha couldn&rsquo;t become more powerful, and so neither could Beta.&nbsp; The idea of its growth being stopped for such a reason was unacceptable.&nbsp; When it heard that Beta was getting help, Alpha knew hope, which only grew when it faced its brother in the ring two months later.&nbsp; Hope changed to joy when its brother struck it in the chest and sent it falling to the ground with but a punch.&nbsp; The improvements, the growth, the fights, these would continue, and this made Alpha very happy.&nbsp; But when Beta&rsquo;s helper left, and the creators were asked to send the pair out into the world with someone it didn&rsquo;t know, it was unsure of itself for the first time.&nbsp; Would it be strong enough, it wondered.&nbsp; Would life continue when it returned once the task was competed?</p> <p>Alpha had some difficulty with its new assignment.&nbsp; It was awkward out in the world, unsure, a giant well armored child exposed to reality.&nbsp; Sadine was patient with it, helping it and its brother learn about its surroundings, the people they met, the land, and so forth.&nbsp; Beta learned faster then Alpha, which was fine with it, since Beta as always helped it learn and become &lsquo;better&rsquo;.&nbsp; But then Sadine disappeared.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t killed, she just was swept away as things sometimes are.&nbsp; Alpha hadn&rsquo;t failed its task, but it did feel remorse.&nbsp; When the brothers decided to part ways, the remorse grew, but Alpha knew that it needed to return, just like it knew that Beta needed to leave.&nbsp; As it headed back towards the city that made it, it also felt hope that it could fight Beta again.</p> <p><strong>Max the Merchant of mysteries and exotic goods</strong> (LLC) (LE/NE): Max the merchant of mysteries was never really good at staying on the up and up.&nbsp; He was equally at home trading above the board as he was dealing below it.&nbsp; He dealt in everything obscure, rare and valuable.&nbsp; Artwork, magic items and spices moved through his hands as often as bizarre and dangerous weapons and narcotics.</p> <p>So when old Max heard about a non-combat style warforged wandering alone and unattended along the ley lines, he couldn&rsquo;t help but send his lackeys to collect.&nbsp; But when he saw Jafik sail through the air like a rotten egg, he felt more then compelled to agree to the warforged &lsquo;reasonable requests.&rsquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So what if I had to keep my dealings legal for a while,&rdquo; he rationalized, &ldquo;with muscle like that I won&rsquo;t have to pay Jafik&rsquo;s overly inflated wages.&nbsp; That alone will recoup the losses inside a month!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he taught Ed about the world according to Max.&nbsp; He gave the warforged a couple trade languages, a history lesson or two (as much as can be taught in such a world) and was just about to start giving him lectures about morality when the cheeky warforged informed him that it had what it needed, and was going to part ways at the next trading post.&nbsp; Max watched his former bodyguard leave, quietly vowing that the next chance he got he would find a way of owning that robot.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><strong>Rules questions<br /> </strong></u></p> <p>Alright, so after something like 2 days spinning my wheels trying to come up with obscure power ideas and systems to run for this character, I&rsquo;ve come to a distressing conclusion:<span>&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean sure we could if we wanted to put the time into it, we could hammer out the entirety of Ed&rsquo;s new style of martial arts and a power progression all the way through to the end of the campaign, but to do so would be an unfair time requirement from both of the DM&rsquo;s , not to mention potentially slowing combat even more down to a crawl every time I have to take a turn.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, I&rsquo;m going to try and keep things simple, and make Ed a Gestalt (that&rsquo;s Simple?!?).</p> <p>Ed is going to be Fighter (primary) Monk (secondary), as this setup should allow me to take prestige classes that are monk centered without impacting on my fighter progression.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve not abandoned the concept of Ed &ldquo;developing&rdquo; his own style of fighting, as I think that concept is too central to the character, and can be represented by the combination of the monk and fighter classes (full base attack progression, weapon training and &lsquo;armor training&rsquo;) and by tweaks to both classes, in addition to the expenditure of merit points during character creation.</p> <p><i>Changes to base classes</i></p> <p><i>Monk:</i> The following abilities in the monk class are either redundant due to race, irrelevant due to setting (and arguably race), or undesired:<span>&nbsp; </span>Purity of body (race is already immune to disease), Diamond body (race is already immune to poison), Quivering palm (I&rsquo;ve never really liked this ability, and although some variation of it is still fitting to the character, as a personal preference I&rsquo;d like to see it drastically changed or replaced altogether) and Timeless body (As the setting is centered around the idea of layline nexuses providing functional immortality, and because the race technically doesn&rsquo;t age, just runs out of power, this power should probably be replaced or altered significantly.)</p> <p>The following abilities should probably be reviewed either due to questions concerning the nature of Gestalt, or how the powers will function in a wound vitality system: Wholeness of body (This power is used to restore HP through the expenditure of Ki, and in your system Ki is vitality, and HP doesn&rsquo;t exist.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you do a simple HP = wounds conversion, the power is significantly powerful, so a different ratio may be desirable) combat maneuver training (my level will be my base attack, should we drop this power from Ed&rsquo;s list and replace it with something else?) And the monk bonus feats (Are monk bonus feats considered a separate class ability to fighter bonus feats, allowing for the gestalt character to receive functionally 2 feats every 4<sup>th</sup> level?<span>&nbsp; </span>Or do they overlap, with the character receiving only 1 bonus feat every 2 levels as per the fighter progression?)</p> <p>The following ability is rendered obsolete by the purchase of a merit, and revision is desired:<span>&nbsp; </span>Slow fall (It is my intention for Ed to pick up a climb speed and a swim speed.<span>&nbsp; </span>My recommendation is for the slow power to be altered to increase his climb speed and swim speed, and perhaps allow for increased maneuvering options, like for example wall jumping, and jumping from the water as if I was standing [and therefore as if I had taken a running start as per High jump class feature] later on)</p> <p>Finally, I would like there to be some change to Perfect self to better represent the apotheosis or transcendence being experienced by a machine rather then the one being experienced by an organic being.</p> <p>Fighter: In addition to what has already been mentioned above, the fighter class has a few minor issues I would like to address:<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>Armor training:<span>&nbsp; </span>Ed isn&rsquo;t so much in armor as he is a body that has armored components.<span>&nbsp; </span>This could cause problems for either class admittedly, but I would like to propose the following; armor training simply increases Ed&rsquo;s natural armor (and therefore not touch AC) by the amount that it would normally increase a fighter&rsquo;s AC, at the normal rate for the class (so one point every four levels).<span>&nbsp; </span>This would allow us to consider Ed to be unarmored for all purposes of the Monk class abilities (and therefore making the class even viable, since he can&rsquo;t exactly remove his arms just so he can punch people harder o.o) while keeping one of the more interesting improvements pathfinder makes to the fighter class.</p> <p>Armor mastery: I think the bonus gained here would make more sense as being integrated as a component of whatever modifications we make to Perfect self (replacing the DR/ Magic to DR/-, probably at some lower level if desirable) would be in better keeping with the character.</p> <p>Weapon Mastery: Most of this power is fine, even with the wounds vitality and critical system in place.<span>&nbsp; </span>Increasing the critical multiplier however is rendered irrelevant by your critical hit system.<span>&nbsp; </span>My recommendation is that this aspect of the power be replaced with increasing the critical threshold by 1 after all other modifications (a lesser version of the ki critical ability from the old 3<sup>rd</sup> ed weapon master.)<span>&nbsp; </span>Admittedly the auto confirming critical portion of that power in addition to the increased critical threshold could increase the lethality of the character to a level you are not comfortable with, so you may have entirely different plans for this class ability.<span>&nbsp; </span>As its intended for the character&rsquo;s chosen weapon to be unarmed strike, I would like to replace the &ldquo;un-disarmable&rdquo; portion of the power with<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;increase CM DC by 2 for maneuvers used against this character&rdquo; or something else you decide is more fitting.</p> <p>This is a lot of suggested alterations to take in all at once, and I&rsquo;m fairly sure this is stretching your rule of three already, so for now I&rsquo;ll leave it at this.<span>&nbsp; </span>The vibration attacks I thought may have been both interesting and unique, but I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll be able to fit it in with all the above (or even if I&rsquo;ll be able to fill in all the above to begin with). &nbsp;Given the significant alterations to build to what I had originally intended, I'm going to need to rehash his background somewhat. &nbsp;I intend to try and get to that some time tomorrow, but time has this habit of not being mine up here, so we'll see how that goes.&nbsp;</p> <p>System questions:<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it possible to ready an action to &ldquo;disarm an opponent of their weapon as they attack&rdquo;?<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>-Is it possible to do so if the opponent is using a reach weapon?<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>-Do the same rulings apply to trip (using the weapon or the lunge as a lead in for throwing your opponent?)<span>&nbsp; </span></p> <p>-What about sunder (smashing the weapon to bits as it gets within reach?&nbsp;</p> <p>Does the DC increase from defensive combat training stack with the DC increases from the improved disarm etc feats? (DC increases appear to be un-typed in feat description.)&nbsp;</p> <p>How does sundering work against magic items?<span>&nbsp; </span>How will it work for attacks that lack an enchantment bonus but otherwise is considered Magical (a monk&rsquo;s ki attack, for example_&nbsp;</p> <p>Will stunning fist uses be tied to vitality?<span>&nbsp; </span>Or will it have a separate pool?&nbsp;</p> <p>Gestalt questions: How does Flurry of Blows work with an altered base attack progression?<span>&nbsp; </span>Is it what one would expect, simply giving you bonus attacks on top of your higher base attack bonus progression?&nbsp;</p> <p>Crack Addled Merit Point things:<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the powers I&rsquo;d like Ed to have is the vibration attacks (dubbed &ldquo;Toladae Myl&rdquo; or Cicada Song by his teacher) that he developed during his back-story.<span>&nbsp; </span>The best way to initially represent this technique that I can think of is to tie 1d6 Sonic damage to his melee attacks, perhaps requiring the expenditure of vitality to allow him to do so.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the activation of this power should have some other effects, such as being audible as a buzzing sound shortly before impact that can be heard with some kind of listen check, as although the sounds generated by the attack aren&rsquo;t themselves necessarily audible to the human ear, they may cause sympathetic vibrations that are.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have I think 18 merit points remaining, and a racial &ldquo;feature&rdquo; yet to be applied, and am willing to allow this malfunction turned boon to be used to pay for this initial power.&nbsp;</p> <p>I would also like for Ed to be able to improve on this technique as he gains levels, as was originally intended when I first came up with the concept.<span>&nbsp; </span>However as I&rsquo;ve decided to go Gestalt, simply paying with merit points as I go is now impossible.<span>&nbsp; </span>So that leaves either turning the technique into some kind of elaborate feat tree, or using the technique to fill holes in the classes made by other incompatibilities, mentioned already by my earlier correspondence.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you would like me to send a &ldquo;class alteration request summary&rdquo; email with both this and the highlights of the previous email, I will be more then willing to compile it.<span>&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;</p> <p>Having no real appreciation for the true value of merit points or what constitutes a proper substitution, all I can offer you is basic ideas of what I would like the technique to do in higher levels:&nbsp;</p> <p>-Increased damage to metal objects during sundering attacks (or when targeting unattended objects made of metal or stone)&nbsp;</p> <p>-Making the sonic component of the damage into a touch attack (if you hit the touch AC and not the full AC, the enemy still takes the sonic damage)&nbsp;</p> <p>-Be able to imbue the sonic damage to objects that are thrown, including objects being returned via combination of the snatch arrow and throw anything feats&nbsp;</p> <p>-Convert the bonus damage resulting from Vitals strikes to sonic damage&nbsp;</p> <p>-Enhance (in some way) the effects of stunning fist (expanding the list of legal targets, or increasing the rounds the target is stunned for, increasing the DC)&nbsp;</p> <p>-And of course, increasing the bonus sonic damage dealt.</p>      </div>
