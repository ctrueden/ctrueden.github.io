<p><strong>Race:</strong> Selectively bred, including human, earth and water elementals, and possibly other, stranger things.</p>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Geomancer with custom bloodline</p>
<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Let's say Neutral Good.&nbsp; Haroun's personality and morality are currently rapidly developing as he's exposed to the outside world.&nbsp; While he's a good person at heart, he isn't actually very good at being good.</p>
<p><strong>Private backstory:&nbsp;&nbsp; (IN&nbsp;PROGRESS)<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Haroun has a nexus within him, upon which he draws for geomantic power and, more importantly, prophecy.&nbsp; The nexus resides within his left lung, slowly growing in size and strength, and this process is killing him.&nbsp; The slow growth has already severed the nerves leading to his left leg, which has been replaced with a technomagical prosthetic.</p>
<p>The nexus within him has several important ramifications.&nbsp; First, it serves as a continuous source of geomantic energy, which can be used for geomancy, and also means that Haroun will never wither.&nbsp; It can also be tapped more directly for dramatic effects, but tapping the nexus directly has fairly severe drawbacks.</p>
<p>The nexus wants to become part of the earth, rather than remaining bound within Haroun's body.&nbsp; Because the nexus is threaded through Haroun's soul, this process would with absolute certainty result in Bad Times (most likely his death).&nbsp; If Haroun taps into the nexus for dramatic effect, or if he stays in the same place for too long a time (e.g. after an 8-hour rest), the nexus will begin to take root, and will require significant time and effort to break free.&nbsp; The nexus is also responsive to the flow of ley energy; if Haroun ventures too close to a large nexus, the large nexus will try to consume him.&nbsp; This pulling is painful to Haroun, and the counter-pull is noticeable to those within the large nexus.&nbsp; A similar &quot;pulling&quot; effect occurs if Haroun stands within a ley line.</p>
<p>Haroun is surrounded at all times by a fine web of ley lines within the earth, which are used by the nexus within him to draw power from the surrounding land.&nbsp; This fine web extends several hundred feet from Haroun.&nbsp; While the lines are not normally noticable, they can be detected using magical means or by unusually perceptive people in dark conditions.&nbsp; Also, these ley lines become much stronger, more visible, and extend further away if Haroun's nexus becomes rooted.&nbsp; As a result, Haroun can be tracked based on this web, and the more he uses the power within his nexus, the more easily he can be found.</p>
<p>Because the ley lines of the nexus are visible upon his skin, were he to disrobe in the presence of a stranger, they would be able to tell that he is not a normal genasi, and that whatever is wrong with him is centered on his left lung.&nbsp; Even through his skin, the nexus within him glows, shedding light as a candle.&nbsp; As a result, he never disrobes in the presence of anyone whom he does not completely trust - and right now, he trusts no one.</p>
<p>I will not specify how exactly the nexus came to be bound within him, but I would speculate that his water elemental heritage is key for retaining mobility.&nbsp; However, his watery nature also makes him more vulnerable to the effects of nexus tides, a normally subtle phenomenon where the power within a nexus waxes and wanes with the phases of the moon.&nbsp; The exact effects of this are open to dicussion.</p>
<p>Haroun is not genasi, though he appears to be.&nbsp; He is actually a much more complicated, selectively-bred and constructed individual, specifically created to house a nexus.&nbsp; However, Haroun is unaware of his unusual bloodline; he inferred that he was a genasi because he was raised among genasi, all of whom appeared roughly similar to him.&nbsp; He has not yet thought to question his heritage, though he draws power from it through a unique bloodline (per sorcerer rules).&nbsp; I'll also likely purchase some powers using merit points which reflect his unusual pedigree.</p>
<p>Haroun was raised in comparative isolation in a compound created which used the same technology as the cities of the technomagical prophets.&nbsp; The compound was built near minor ley lines (none large enough to cause Haroun significant discomfort, but still allow his keepers to demonstrate geomantic principles), and was completely enclosed.&nbsp; His keepers left, and the supervisors came, through teleportation portals built into the compound, but Haroun was never allowed to leave.&nbsp; This was the only life he ever knew, and he never questioned it until recently.</p>
<p>His early days were idyllic.&nbsp; He was cared for and tutored by his six keepers, all genasi.&nbsp; He never knew his parents, but does not realize that this was unusual.&nbsp; He was trained extensively in the wielding of geomantic energies and a wide variety of esoteric principles.&nbsp; He was taught about the values and the majesty of the technomagical prophet culture, and his place within it.&nbsp; He was taught personal combat for self-defense.&nbsp; Most importantly, he was taught to tap his nexus for prophecy, which is how he spent most of his time.</p>
<p>Haroun is uncertain how old he is, partially because he lived completely indoors with no windows, spending much of his time immersed in prophecy and subject to nexus tides, all of which contributed to a poor accounting of time.&nbsp; He's probably about 24 years old, but doesn't know for sure.&nbsp; He may or may not be mortal.&nbsp; It's also possible that his keepers may have done things to his memory, or that the flow of time within the compound was altered somehow.&nbsp; The group that created Haroun was obviously very well-funded and devoted to the project.</p>
<p>Much of what he was taught during this time - he was fed a long line of stories about how he was like all the other prophets, and how many of the things that were done to him were normal, as well as mythology and stories about what was to come - were blatant lies.&nbsp; He was never told of the boundless sky, or the sun, the rain, or the tremendous variety of things in the world.</p>
<p>And then, one night, everything changed.&nbsp; A team of attackers breached the walls of Haroun's compound.&nbsp; Their origin and motives were unclear, but they killed Haroun's keepers.&nbsp; He escaped, but whether this was deliberate or simply due to his foresight, geomantic power, and ability for self-preservation is unclear.</p>
<p>Since escaping, he is being hunted by multiple parties; one from within the empire, and two from within the technomagical prophets.&nbsp; He has become aware that much of what he was told throughout his life were lies, and has become bitter and disenfranchised, though in truth, he wishes he could return to innocence, from which he never desired to fall.</p>
<p>There's more to the backstory, but this is a start, and I'm kind of burned out from writing at the moment.&nbsp; Please note that one of the source materials I'm attempting to draw from (in part) for this character is the story of Siddhartha.&nbsp; I'm using Tolkien's Elvish for elf and eladrin names, Celtic for dwarf names, Arabic names for genasi, and common nouns for warforged.</p>
<p><u>Description of the technomagical compound:</u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Haroun refers to the technomagical building that he was raised in as his &quot;shell&quot;, in what should be a fairly self-evident analogy.<br />
<br />
<u>The night of the attack</u>:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been three months and seven days since I was broken out of my shell, but I still remember the events of that night with perfect clarity.<br />

<u><b>Haroun's psychological profile:&nbsp;&nbsp; (IN&nbsp;PROGRESS)<br />
</b></u></p>
<p>Haroun is incredibly naive.</p>
<p><u><b>NPC Descriptions:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (IN&nbsp;PROGRESS)<br />
</b></u>Note:&nbsp; Arabic names were taken from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sudairy.com/">www.sudairy.com</a>.&nbsp; Eladrin names are &quot;elfier&quot; version of arabic bases.<br />
Celtic names were found in a variety of places on the internet.<br />
<br />
<u>Haroun's Keepers<br />
</u>Six Genasi attended Haroun in the shell.&nbsp; They were carefully selected to keep him under control; to anticipate his needs, and meet them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Anas</u> (M, Firesoul Genasi, Believed Deceased)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Physical Description:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Anas appeared as a heavyset, jolly firesoul genasi; his skin was a deep red on the thicker parts of his body, thinning to a lighter orange-red at his extremities.&nbsp; Rather than hair, he had a thin mane of perpetually burning flame.&nbsp; Anas was fond of wearing comfortable, free-flowing silks.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Relationship with Haroun:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Anas served as Haroun's teacher for history, culture, and ethics.&nbsp; Though very fond of Anas during his stay in the shell, Haroun now realizes that virtually everything that Anas taught him was a lie, and feels deeply betrayed and bitter.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Personality:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Anas was incredibly creative, playful, and charismatic, and also had a tremendously good memory (necessary to keep all the stories straight).&nbsp; He taught Haroun using stories and parables, occasionally sung or set to Aisha's music.&nbsp; Many of the early stories and the old myths that Anas told were the same types of stories that bards tell, but often had names, morals, or important details changed.&nbsp; The history and culture were outright fabrications, though incredibly detailed, consistent, and often based loosely in the truth (though Haroun does not recognize this).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">It's unclear whether Anas was actually directed to lie, or if he did so of his own volition.&nbsp; He may have been a pathological liar, but his stories appeared carefully crafted to control Haroun's behavior.&nbsp; Anas taught Haroun never to lie, to trust unfailingly in the goodness of those who cared for him, to smile, to work hard, and that he would be rewarded for his hard work in this life.&nbsp; Anas also taught Haroun that the gods (or, as he called them, &quot;coherent natural forces&quot;) did not really exist; only prophecy exists, and the collective will of society sculpts the power of prophecy into society-spanning things that alter the flow of things.&nbsp; Though the gods appear real and immutable, according to Anas they are very mutable and change as society does.&nbsp; Anas painted the Technomagical Prophets as an enlightened people who recognized this truth, while the surrounding peoples and the evil Empire which threatened them were savage and superstitious.&nbsp; Of course, by touching the power of prophecy directly, Haroun was among the highest and noblest tier of mortals.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Notes:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Budail's skin was a dark greyish purple, almost black; the color of an impending thunderstorm.&nbsp; His eyes were lit from within by a quiet power and intensity.&nbsp; Being near him, small hairs stood on edge and a faint smell of ionization was</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Relationship with Haroun:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Budail taught Haroun the arts of geomancy, insight, and the magical natures of things.&nbsp; He taught Haroun how to reach inside himself to tap into his true power and potential, as well as how to reach into magical objects and devices to acitve their true potential.&nbsp; He emphasized self-knowledge, confidence, and the tapping of one's own emotions as the true paths to power.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Personality:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Budail always appeared calm on the surface, but inside, was extremely intense and severe.&nbsp; Though he never took any action against Haroun, the young prophet was always stuck between mild terror and awe of the stormsoul.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Notes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&quot;Sorrowful one&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Dee and Kaie both speak a highly complex private language.&nbsp; Since adulthood, they have adapted it to be able to be silently signed.&nbsp; They have taught several useful bits to Kas and Biji.&nbsp; Frustratingly for everyone else, however, the exact details of the language seem to change significantly every time the pair of dwarves is caught in Flow.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dee and Kaie always try to stick close enough together so that if a quake occurs, either both will be caught, or neither will.</p>

<ul>
    <li><u>Biji</u> (M, troll)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Physical Description:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Biji is a massive troll, and intentionally dresses like a stereotypical troll warrior / shaman, complete with a skull necklace and a dirty club.&nbsp; Extremely sharp-eyed and sharp-nosed individuals may notice that his hygiene is actually excellent (even his breath!), making it nearly impossible to smell him coming.&nbsp; Despite his size, he is silent and nearly invisible when he wishes to be.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Personality:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Biji is deceptively smart.&nbsp; He plays up the &quot;stupid savage&quot;&nbsp;role that most of his opponents expect until he can decisively act to gain the advantage.&nbsp; He will often let blows land, due to his ability to regenerate, then pretend that those blows are actually wounding or partially incapacitating him.&nbsp; This is merely a ruse to lower his opponents' guards, and also to amuse Biji.&nbsp; He has a very dark and twisted sense of humor, with a definite cruel streak.&nbsp; When confronted with an opponent who has no hope of defeating him, he will play with the foe, which can draw fire from his more professional comrades.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">His role in the party is, in part, muscle and combat prowess, though he is a skilled and stealthy infiltrator.&nbsp; He also wields shamanistic powers and negative energies to somehow disrupt spellcasting and the function of magical items; he also somehow controls light levels to aid in his group's stealth when necessary.&nbsp; His participation was crucial for breaking the shell open.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Notes:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">It's a troll name.&nbsp; There is no symbolism here.&nbsp; What do you expect?</p>
<p><u>Those who hunt Haroun<br />
</u>Of the empire:</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Gawain</u> (M, dwarf)</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Physical Description:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Gawain is stout and cheerful, lithe and observant.&nbsp; He dresses in simple armor, with a haversack on his back that appears to be completely full.&nbsp; Though he wears a ring of sustenance, he snacks frequently, and never hesitates to offer hospitality to those he meets.&nbsp; He is the model of a well-off traveller.&nbsp; He clinks in an exaggerated fashion when he moves, unless he desires stealth, and then he makes not a single sound.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Personality:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Gawain is a highly-skilled and ruthless scout and ranger for the Empire.&nbsp; He is immensely fond of the finer things in life, including fine teas, sweet cookies, and comfortable lodgings; however, he will never sacrifice expediency for these comforts while on the job.&nbsp; He carries a large number of these in the handy haversack on his back.&nbsp; If he is deprived of his comforts, his cold and ruthless efficiency will simply be replaced by a furious swiftness.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Gawain ultimately works as a tracker and a bounty hunter for the Church of Moradin, which constitutes part of the government of the Empire.&nbsp; He is immensely pragmatic and incredibly devout.&nbsp; He prays daily (at sunrise) to Moradin for swiftness in his journeys and a safe return home to his wife and four children (he is fairly old, and has many children, but only four are young enough to live at home).&nbsp; His sense of honor is derived from both his god's teachings and from his pragmatism; he exists somewhere between lawful neutral and lawful good.&nbsp; He will help those in need if he can, but feels little loyalty or compassion toward those who live outside the Empire, because the Empire accepts all who come seeking aid.&nbsp; He will not kill unless he must, and the church almost never asks him to.&nbsp; The church pays him well for his services because he is so skilled; he does not haggle over his price, and would work for less if the church commanded him.&nbsp; However, the church wisely recognizes the value of keeping such a skilled and fiathful servant happy.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">His faith and pragmatism intersect nicely with regards to his loyalty to the Empire.&nbsp; He regards the fact that he does not need to refresh or worry about quakes causing instability in his home life as great gifts from his god.&nbsp; When he is out in the world, he avoids quakes if possible.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">Gawain is skilled at reading ley lines and maneuvering through the lands of the nomads and independent villages.&nbsp; Speaking with him, most find him eccentric, charming, and harmless - a rustic traveler, seeing the world.&nbsp; Only his quiet morning prayers betray his origin.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">In combat, Gawain uses a merciful longbow, occasionally combined with silence items, to incapacitate his opponents while they are off-guard, before they realize what has occurred.&nbsp; He sweeps in, grabs his target, and sweeps back out, leaving any guards or companions alive, and leaving any supplies untouched.&nbsp; He recovers his arrows and covers his tracks, to leave no trace with which he might later be found.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">On the travel back, he is pleasant and cordial to his kidnapped target.&nbsp; He will offer his creature comforts to the target, but will not force them to partake if they are unwilling.&nbsp; He makes it very clear that they will not be harmed (by him or by the church) if they cooperate, but that any attempt to escape will be met with swift retaliation.&nbsp; If necessary, he simply keeps his target unconscious.</p>

<p><strong><u>Non-combat geomancy</u><u> (IDEAS/DRAFT)</u><br />
</strong><br />
<b>Superposited Bag</b><br />
Type: Quantum Superposition<br />
Level: 1 or 2<br />
Casting Time: 1 minute<br />
Duration: 1 day per level, until discharged<br />
Target: One bag or container<br />
Effect:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">This spell may be cast at any point when the character is choosing to pack a bag.&nbsp; The character closes the bag ceremoniously, and the contents of the bag enter flux.<br />
Up to one day per caster level later, the character may, upon opening the bag, decide what the bag contains.&nbsp; The contents of the bag must have been possible - the character must have had unfettered access to the relevant items, and the items must&nbsp; have been able to fit inside the bag.&nbsp; Once opened, the spell ends; the contents of the bag are decided and cannot be changed.<br />
This spell may also be used when the character has the opportunity to purchase items, such as a store setting.&nbsp; In this variant, the character places currency or valuable items for trade in the bag before closing it, and when opening it, finds items of up to that value (based on the prices of the store), plus change, if any.<br />
While the contents of the bag are in flux, the bag's weight is as though empty, or as the weight of the currency or trade items placed in it, as appropriate.<br />
If the bag is opened or breached in any way other than by a deliberate opening of the caster, the flux collapses randomly.&nbsp; This usually means the contents of the bag are unchanged, but can result in any packing configuration that was possible (GM's discretion).&nbsp; Similarly, if the caster attempts to collapse the flux into an impossible outcome, the flux collapses into the closest possible outcome.</div>

<b>Perfect Phrase</b></p>
<p>Type: Probability Alteration</p>
<p>Level: 1 or 2</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 standard action</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Target: Self</p>
<p>Effect:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The caster reaches into the sea of probability and chooses the best thing to say in pursuit of a specific end.&nbsp; This spell can be used to create the perfect apology (&quot;I didn't realize that vase was so important to you, I'm sorry&quot;), perfect bribe (&quot;Would you let me in if I promised you a bottle of 14-year-old scotch?&quot;), perfect reality check (&quot;What would your children think if they saw you now?&quot;), etc.&nbsp; If the relevant phrase is a lie, the caster will still need to roll a bluff check to deliver it.<br />
This spell does not allow the caster to do what cannot be done; if there is nothing he could say to convincingly bribe a guard, for example, then the spell fails.</div>
<p><br />
<b>Avoid Catastrophic Failure</b></p>
<p>Type: Prophecy</p>
<p>Level: 1</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 standard action</p>
<p>Duration: 10 minutes per level</p>
<p>Target: One creature</p>
<p>Effect:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For the duration of the spell, whenever the target attempts a skill check which has a catastrophic failure option (an &quot;if you fail by 5 or more&quot; type option, such as climb, disable device, UMD, etc.), the caster is granted a momentary insight before any spectacular failure occurs.&nbsp; The caster may use this insight to warn the target and interrupt the action, stopping the catastrophe.&nbsp; This spell only functions if the catastrophic failure is obvious; for example, it could not prevent the target from failing an appraise check by 5 or more.<br />
Please note that some uses of this spell, such as stopping a diplomacy check that is about to catastrophically fail, may not be feasible (&quot;Stop talking!&nbsp; You're screwing it up!&quot;).</div>

<p><strong><u>Combat geomancy&nbsp;(IDEAS/DRAFT)</u><br />
</strong><br />
<b>Split Attack</b></p>
<p>Type: Controlled Quake</p>
<p>Level: 2 or 3</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 standard action</p>
<p>Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>Target: One attack, where both the target and initiator are within medium range</p>
<p>Effect:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Warriors always make decisions about who to attack in a combat.&nbsp; This spell takes advantage of that uncertainty.<br />
When this spell is cast, the caster chooses a single attack which occurred less than one full round ago (the caster may not choose an attack that he himself made).&nbsp; The initiator of that attack rolls the attack again, against a different target, including any temporary bonuses.&nbsp; A quake occurs around the new target, who is affected by the attack as the dice indicate.&nbsp; The original target of the attack is unchanged.<br />
This spell cannot be used to cause the same creature to be attacked twice.</div>
<p><br />
<b>Offensive Superposition</b></p>
<p>Type: Quantum Superposition</p>
<p>Level: 1 or 2</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 standard action</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round per level, until discharged</p>
<p>Target: One willing creature</p>
<p>Effect:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The target's weapon blurs as multiple possible realities blend together into a superposition.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">For the duration of the spell, any attack the target makes must be rolled twice.&nbsp; The first time the two results differ (miss vs. hit, hit vs. crit), then the superposition collapses into the outcome that is more favorable for the target.&nbsp; This ends the spell.</div>
<p><br />
<b>Defensive Superposition</b></p>
<p>Type: Quantum Superposition</p>
<p>Level: 1 or 2</p>
<p>Casting Time: 1 standard action</p>
<p>Duration: 1 round per level, until discharged</p>
<p>Target: One willing creature</p>
<p>Effect:</p>
<p>The target's form blurs as multiple possible realities blend together into a superposition.</p>
<p>For the duration of the spell, any attack against the target must be rolled twice.&nbsp; The first time the two results differ (miss vs. hit, hit vs. crit), then the superposition collapses into the outcome that is more favorable for the target.&nbsp; This ends the spell.</p>
