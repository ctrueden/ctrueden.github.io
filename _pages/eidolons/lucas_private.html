He often (but not always) rejoins the same group as before, as      the new persona<o:p></o:p></li>     <li class="MsoNormal" style="">When no one is around, he      looks kind of like a &quot;dirty hippie&quot;<o:p></o:p></li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p> <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><strong><u>NPCs</u></strong><o:p></o:p></p> <p><strong>&quot;Children of Kumo&quot;</strong> - When Kumo breeds, he creates a copy that is loosely based on him, but is influenced by the circumstances of the &quot;birth&quot;.&nbsp; It takes the form of whatever Kumo was at the time the quake was initiated, although obviously, being Kitsune, this form is easily malleable.&nbsp; Its personality is heavily influenced by the emotional state of the person for whom the wish is granted.<o:p></o:p></p> <p><em>Kasumi&nbsp; (Spring Haze): </em>Kasumi was born from the confusion of a farmer.&nbsp; The farmer had inherited his family farm and had been working it his entire adult life.&nbsp; As a child, it was impressed on him both how much an honor the inheritance was, as well as how much of a responsibility he had to his family to keep the farm running.&nbsp; The farmer felt trapped in this role, unfulfilled, but subconsciously.&nbsp; It wasn't until Kumo granted his wish to be free of his farm that he realized how much he yearned to be free of it.<o:p></o:p></p> <p>Kasumi was created at this point, and due to the farmer's confusion and lack of self-reflection, Kasumi does not know who he is or what he wants.&nbsp; He is ignorant of his powers, using them only in instinctual self-defense.&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was initially &quot;born&quot;, he was dressed as a well-to-do provincial merchant, in clothing that was simple but well-made.&nbsp; However, since then Kasumi has simply been wandering, living by foraging or begging, and his clothes have turned to rags.&nbsp; Appearing always as a male elf except in rare cases where he manages to change form, Kasumi constantly wears a look of shock and incomprehension.&nbsp; Because he does not realize he was &quot;born&quot; from Kumo, he simply thinks he has amnesia, and has forgotten his past.&nbsp; Most people think him mad.<o:p></o:p></p> <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p> <p><em>Tora (Tiger):&nbsp; </em>Tora was born from a Geomancer, who had previously trusted and liked Kumo. &nbsp;When Kumo initiated his &quot;wish quake,&quot; the Geomancer was able to &quot;read&quot; it and realized what was happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;His last feelings were those of anger, hatred, betrayal, and a strong desire to kill Kumo.<o:p></o:p></p> <p>Thus, Tora endlessly hunts Kitsune in general and those of Kumo's line in particular.&nbsp; He is totally, absolutely committed to this impossible task; all things exist as a means to this end.&nbsp; He is aware of and in control of his powers, but generally eschews illusion, subterfuge and any manner of subtlety in favor of good old-fashioned violence.&nbsp; He tends to favor the Nomads due to their freedom of movement. &nbsp;(Kitsune, in general, avoid the Empire. &nbsp;The inability to quake is existentially distasteful to them.)&nbsp; Tora is a 3 point enemy.<o:p></o:p></p> <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p> <p><em>Kaeribana (Flowers blooming out of season): </em>Kaeribana was &quot;born&quot; from a young woman who desperately wished for true love.&nbsp; Kaeribana was thus created from the wish, both the offspring of Kumo and the fulfillment of the wish itself, as the young woman's perfect mate.&nbsp; Sadly, the Kitsune are a long-lived and very robust species, and he outlived his intended mate.<o:p></o:p></p> <p>He wanders now, as Kitsune are wont to do.&nbsp; He only remembers vague bits about the young woman, mostly remember from the beginning of her life rather than the end, because that was the reason for his being.&nbsp; He has not met Kumo since his birth, but if he does, he will be passionately in love with Kumo, mirroring the love of the young woman.<o:p></o:p></p> <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p> <p><em>Shiki and Shinkumo Nodoka</em>&nbsp;<em>(Shiki - Four Season Shinkumo - From Shin, meaning true or reborn, and Kumo, the character&nbsp; Nodoka - Tranquil):&nbsp; </em>Shiki met Kumo and immediately knew who he was, accepting him and his nature.&nbsp; Shiki and Kumo had a brief romantic encounter, in which she was supportive, understanding, and caring, seeming to love Kumo unconditionally.&nbsp; &nbsp;She desired nothing but the happiness and fulfillment of Kumo, through their relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;From this wish Shinkumo was born, and the two have paired up, living together.<o:p></o:p></p> <p>Shiki has a great deal of knowledge about the existence and lore of the Kitsune, in actuality being a very old Kitsune herself, much older than Kumo.&nbsp; As Shiki and&nbsp;Shinkumo are both Kitsune in full knowledge and control of their abilities, gender and appearance are fluid with them.&nbsp; Long-term pairing is rare with the Kitsune, but at least for now, Shiki and Shinkumo are very content to be together.<o:p></o:p></p> <p><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p> <p><strong>Non-Children:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p> <p><em>Yaremka:</em> A male tiefling shopkeeper in the Underdark.&nbsp; Kumo visits him often when in the guise of a merchant, in the guise of an attractive female tiefling.&nbsp; Initially, this gave Kumo a mild advantage in commerce, and Kumo has kept the form to provide continuity of character.&nbsp; Although Kumo has not tried to breed with Yaremka, Yaremka is aware that there's something going on with Kumo.&nbsp; This is because Kumo makes very random business decisions, generally buying stuff to fuel illusions (and using the shop as a place to refill the Useful Pouch) rather than based on actual value.&nbsp; Additionally, some of Kumo's stuff has proven to be illusory in the past.&nbsp; However, since they have something of a friendship now, Yaremka has been able to cheat Kumo on a few occasions do to its very odd buying habits, and the fact that Kumo has never done anything overly destructive, Yaremka tolerates this and looks forward to seeing spider.&nbsp; Yaremka assumes that Kumo is basically a traveling shyster, moving to keep ahead of his last victim.</p> <p><o:p><br /> </o:p></p> <hr /> <p><u><strong>Geomancy ideas<br /> </strong></u></p> <p>Force agreement with minor lie (Lucas):</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Lucas: &quot;I'm hitchhiking, I need to go to Milwaukee&quot;<br /> Victim: &quot;But I'm going to Minneapolis&quot;<br /> Lucas: &quot;Oh, we're going to the same place!&quot;<br /> Victim: &quot;Yes we are!&quot;<br /> Can either change the person to be going where you said, or change what you said to be going where they said.</p> <p>Rerolls</p> <ul>     <li>Force reroll of sense motive vs bluff -- tell a new bluff</li>     <li>Force reroll a bluff check</li>     <li>Roll twice and take the better</li> </ul> <p>Seem more familiar (both Andy &amp;
