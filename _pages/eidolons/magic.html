        <p>We are making several changes to traditional D&amp;D magic:</p>
<ol>
    <li>There is no prepared spellcasting. <a href="/eidolons/classes/runemage">Runemages</a>&nbsp;(wizards), <a href="/eidolons/classes/cleric">clerics</a>, <a href="/eidolons/classes/champion">champions</a>&nbsp;(paladins) and <a href="/eidolons/classes/ranger">rangers</a> are spontaneous casters with limited spell selection.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Caster levels for <a href="/eidolons/classes/bard">bards</a>, clerics, <a href="/eidolons/classes/druid">druids</a>, <a href="/eidolons/classes/geomancer">geomancers</a> (sorcerers) and runemages advance at half rate, on odd levels. For example, a 13th level cleric counts as a 7th level spellcaster, and hence has just learned 4th level spells. A 20th level runemage is a 10th level spellcaster who wields 5th level spells.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>There are no spell slots. Rather, casting spells is now tied to vitality. The cost of a spell equals the minimum class level needed to know that spell. For example, the aforementioned 13th level cleric pays 13 vitality to cast <i>destruction</i> (a 7th level spell). A 20th level paladin pays 16 vitality to manifest <i>holy sword</i>, because 16th level is when he first obtains 4th level spells. Vitality returns at a rate of 1 per round. In summary, this system means that magic users have less punch but always have something left to cast.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Talk to us if you want to play a necromancer.<br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><a href="/eidolons/rules/psionics">Psionics</a> will not be allowed, but rune magic is thematically similar enough that you could play a psion-flavored character.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Metamagic feats<br />
</strong></u></p>
<p>To use a metamagic feat, spend vitality corresponding to the adjusted level of the spell. You are limited to your normal maximum effective spell level as normal. Casting a spell with one or more metamagic feats requires a full-round action, as normal for spontaneous casters, with the exception of quickened spells. Runemages who want to &quot;slow cast&quot; to avoid expending a rune can do so with a metamagically adjusted spell, but it takes a number of rounds corresponding to the effective spell level&mdash;e.g., maximized acid arrow takes 5 full rounds to cast.</p>      </div>
