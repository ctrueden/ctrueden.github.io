        <p>The following geomancer spells serve as examples for what can be done at each tier of the class. Others are certainly possible; if you wish to invent a custom geomancer spell, feel free to do so, balancing against those listed here, and run it by the GMs for approval. This list is absolutely not intended to be exhaustive, nor even necessarily fully representative of what is possible&mdash;they are just a few examples to get you started. And feel free to take anything on this list if it suits your character, as many of the spells were modeled after specific suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Apprentice Powers</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Attune Nexus</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 day<br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: Permanent until changed.<br />
Area:&nbsp;Nexus</p>
<p>This ritual takes one full day of constant meditation to perform.&nbsp; The Geomancer attunes himself with a Nexus, focusing on a type of enchantment he wishes to attune the Nexus to.&nbsp; The Nexus will thereafter be able to fuel the creation of one item per point of Essence, so long as the other conditions (masterwork items, spellcasters with the appropriate level and spells) are met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Avoid Catastrophic Failure</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Component:&nbsp;Quake<br />
Range:&nbsp;Touch<br />
Duration: 10 minutes per level<br />
Target: One creature</p>
<p>For the duration of the spell, whenever the target attempts a skill check which has a catastrophic failure option (an &quot;if you fail by 5 or more&quot; type option, such as climb, disable device, UMD, etc.), the caster is granted a momentary insight before any spectacular failure occurs.&nbsp; The caster may use this insight to warn the target and interrupt the action, stopping the catastrophe.&nbsp; This spell only functions if the catastrophic failure is obvious; for example, it could not prevent the target from failing an appraise check by 5 or more.<br />
Please note that some uses of this spell, such as stopping a diplomacy check that is about to catastrophically fail, may not be feasible (&quot;Stop talking!&nbsp; You're screwing it up!&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clouding the Moment</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 Swift action.<br />
Component: Quake<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range:&nbsp; 20' radius around the Geomancer.</p>
<p>This power must be activated immediately following the use of an area-altering Geomancy or illusory effect.&nbsp; Creatures in the area are inclined to believe that nothing has changed and in fact the change has in fact always been present.&nbsp; A will save vs. the Geomancer's Disguise check will allow the character to remember the moment of the change.&nbsp; The magnitude of the change may give the subjects bonuses to their saving throw; a minor change (such as removing a minor tear in clothing, or smoothing one's hair) grants no bonus, but significant changes can grant a +5 (noticeable change, such as adding a necklace, removing a hat or changing eye color), +10 (significant change, such as shifting between beggar's rags and royal garb), +15 (&quot;Oh, you only -pretended- to stab him!&quot;) up to +20 for a profound change (&quot;Why have we been carrying this corpse around?&quot;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cure Illness</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: Concentration<br />
Range: Touch</p>
<p>When this power is activated, the Geomancer touches a victim suffering from a nonmagical illness&nbsp;and floods their body with healing energies, immediately&nbsp;removing the disease.&nbsp; This power does not restore ability damage lost&nbsp;to the disease unless&nbsp;one of the subject's ability scores was reduced to 0, in which case it restores&nbsp;each ability score to a minimum&nbsp;of 1, and cannot remove ability drain at all.&nbsp; This ability costs one Essence to the Ley Line for each round it is active, and for each illness cured, the Geomancer must expend two points of Vitality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dream</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 Standard Action <br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: 12 hours.<br />
Range: Personal</p>
<p>This power is often used by the Technoprophets to communicate between Nexuses.&nbsp; By forming a brief connection to the Nexus in which the Apprentice intends to sleep, he may experience a waking dream and communicate with the dreams of a specific creature as he rests.&nbsp; This creature must be named during the invocation of this power and must be sleeping within a Nexus during the time when the Apprentice is sleeping, or this power fails.&nbsp; If successful, the Apprentice may enter the dream of his target and communicate freely with him, pulling the target into a waking dream of their own.&nbsp; Up to ten full minutes of communication can occur before the participants are pulled back into their normal dreams.</p>
<p>Additionally, prophetic dreams can result from this power as well.&nbsp; These events are not consistent, but often provide different insights from those commonly received by using the Geomancy skill.&nbsp; Technoprophet devices that have been infused with this power occasionally speak words of prophecy, much to the consternation of Technoprophet sages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ease Pain</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round.<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: Concentration<br />
Range: Touch</p>
<p>This power enables the Geomancer to tap into the energy of a Ley Line to heal physical injuries.&nbsp; He spends one round attuning to the Ley Line, and each round thereafter, may touch a single creature, healing their wounds.&nbsp; For each round the Geomancer concentrates, he may restore wounds in exchange for his own vitality on a one-for-one basis.&nbsp; For each round the effect is active, the Ley Line loses one point of Essence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Following the Thread</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: 1 round.<br />
Range: Close (25' + 5' / 2 levels)<br />
Target: One creature<br />
<br />
This power allows someone to read the past of the target in a general way.&nbsp; This power can give the Geomancer some insight into the strongest emotions that have affected the character, and possibly additional general information (DM discretion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy Recall</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round.<br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range: Personal</p>
<p>With this power, a Geomancer can revisit a prophecy previously experienced.&nbsp; The character will then fall into the throes of a prophecy that will closely resemble, but never perfectly mirror a prophecy they have had before.&nbsp; This power is often used by novice Geomancers if they do not clearly recall their experiences, but even masters occasionally wish to revisit a prophecy in an attempt to find more answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stumble</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level: Apprentice<br />
Casting Time:&nbsp;Immediate Action<br />
Component: Quake<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range:&nbsp;Close (25' + 5' / 2 levels)<br />
Target:&nbsp;One enemy within range.</p>
<p>Some Geomancers focus their efforts toward bringing fortune to their allies, but others choose to inflict misfortune upon their enemies.&nbsp; Using this power, the Geomancer uses a small quake to distract an opponent at a critical moment, giving the chosen foe a -2 luck penalty to attack or Armor Class when resolving a single attack against that enemy.&nbsp; This power must be declared before the&nbsp;attack is rolled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Twist of Fate</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time:&nbsp;Immediate Action<br />
Component: Quake<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range:&nbsp;Close (25'&nbsp;+&nbsp;5' / 2 levels)<br />
Target:&nbsp;Self or one ally.</p>
<p>Even an Apprentice Geomancer has the ability to alter the likelihood of an event through the creation of a localized quake.&nbsp; By using this power, the Geomancer can choose to give himself&nbsp;or a nearby ally&nbsp;+4 luck bonus to a saving throw.&nbsp; This power may be used after the die has been rolled but before success or failure has been determined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Useful Pouch</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level:&nbsp;Apprentice<br />
Casting Time: 1 minute<br />
Component:&nbsp;Quake<br />
Duration: 1 day per level, until discharged<br />
Range:&nbsp;Touch<br />
Target: One bag or container</p>
<p>This spell may be cast at any point when the character is choosing to pack a bag.&nbsp; The character closes the bag ceremoniously, and the bag becomes the focus of a quake waiting to occur.&nbsp; Up to one day per caster level later, the character may, upon opening the bag, decide what the bag contains.&nbsp; The contents of the bag must have been possible - the character must have had unfettered access to the relevant items, and the items must&nbsp; have been able to fit inside the bag.</p>
<p>Once opened, the spell ends; the contents of the bag are decided and cannot be changed.&nbsp; This spell may also be used when the character has the opportunity to purchase items, such as a store setting.&nbsp; In this variant, the character places currency or valuable items for trade in the bag before closing it, and when opening it, finds items of up to that value (based on the prices of the store), plus change, if any.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the bag is opened, the bag's weight is as&nbsp;treated as if it were empty, or as the weight of the currency or trade items placed in it, as appropriate.&nbsp; If the bag is opened or breached in any way other than by a deliberate opening of the caster, the contents are randomly determined.&nbsp; This usually means the contents of the bag are unchanged, but can result in any packing configuration that was possible (GM's discretion).&nbsp; Similarly, if the caster attempts to&nbsp;choose an impossible outcome, the&nbsp;contents of the bag become the closest possible outcome (again, GM's discretion).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Adept&nbsp;Powers</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Defensive Current</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Component:&nbsp;Quake<br />
Duration: 1 round per level, until discharged<br />
Range:&nbsp;Close (25' + 5' / 2 levels)<br />
Target: One willing creature</p>
<p>By enacting this power, the Geomancer shields himself or an ally by slightly altering the flow of events.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the duration of the spell, any attack against the target must be rolled twice.&nbsp; The first time the two results differ (miss vs. hit, hit vs. crit),&nbsp;a minor quake occurs and the outcome that is more favorable for the target becomes the result.&nbsp; This ends the spell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Eye of Fate</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 minute<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: 1 round per level<br />
Range: Close (25' + 5' / 2 levels)<br />
Target: 1 creature<br />
Save: Will negates (See Text)<br />
<br />
A more sophisticated version of Follow the Thread, this power allows the Adept to see specific incidents of the target's history.&nbsp; The Geomancer must have some idea of what events the target has participated in, or the questions he asks are meaningless.&nbsp; The Geomancer may ask one such question each round, and the target may attempt a Will save against each such question.&nbsp; If at any time the Will save succeeds, this power ends and the target becomes aware that the Geomancer has been delving into their past.&nbsp; Should the Geomancer ask all of the questions allowed during the duration without the target passing their save (or ends the effect prematurely instead of continuing his questioning), the target will not be aware of this power's use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Focus Energy</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: Up to 1 round per level.<br />
Range: Personal</p>
<p>An Adept of Geomancy can call upon the Ley Lines to protect him.&nbsp; By enacting this power, he may create a weapon from the pure energy of a nearby Ley Line or Nexus.&nbsp; The strength of this weapon is dependent on the power of the Geomancer, but regardless, each round the Ley Line or Nexus loses one point of essence.</p>
<p>The weapon has an enhancement bonus equal to +1 per three Geomancer levels (maximum +3) and deals 1d8 points of pure energy damage per two Geomancer levels (maximum 5d8 at caster level 10), and is treated as a Brilliant Energy weapon.&nbsp; The character must wield the weapon personally, and cannot be disarmed of it.&nbsp; The weapon created can be any weapon with which the character is familiar, including ranged weapons.&nbsp; Ranged weapons create their own ammunition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fortune's Wake</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 swift action<br />
Component: Quake<br />
Duration: 1 round or until discharged<br />
Range:&nbsp;Personal<br />
Target: Self</p>
<p>Using this power, the Adept can follow the most likely flow, and cause his subsequent action to follow that course instead of that normally dictated by chance.&nbsp; On any&nbsp;single attack roll, saving&nbsp;throw, or skill check&nbsp;made before the start of his next turn, the Geomancer may take a result of 10 on the die in lieu of rolling.&nbsp; This decision must be made before the die is rolled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Known Outcome</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 hour <br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range: Personal</p>
<p>By spending some time at a Nexus, the Adept can learn the most likely outcome to a particular question.&nbsp; The answer will always be reasonably accurate, but the vagaries of chance can interfere with the given outcome, and in some cases the Technoprophets or younger Nomads will actively try to interfere to gain a more favorable result.</p>
<p>Should the Adept use this power to discover a truth about his own future, he can attempt a Geomancy skill check to recall this prophecy when the events he prophesies begin to unfold (DC:20).&nbsp; If successful, he gains a +5 luck bonus to any check, attack roll, or saving throw associated with the fulfillment or destruction of the events of the prophecy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Offensive Current</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Fate<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Component: Quake<br />
Duration: 1 round per level, until discharged<br />
Range:&nbsp;Close (25' + 5' / 2 levels)<br />
Target: One willing creature</p>
<p>The target's weapon becomes a focal point for a small quake.&nbsp; For the duration of the spell, any attack the target makes must be rolled twice.&nbsp; The first time the two results differ (miss vs. hit, hit vs. crit),&nbsp;a minor&nbsp;quake occurs and&nbsp;the outcome that is more favorable for the target becomes the result.&nbsp; This ends the spell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Phrase</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time:&nbsp;1 standard action<br />
Component:&nbsp;Quake<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range:&nbsp;Personal<br />
Target: Self</p>
<p>The caster reaches into&nbsp;a sea of possible&nbsp;futures for an instant&nbsp;and chooses the best thing to say in pursuit of a specific end.&nbsp; This&nbsp;power can be used to create the perfect apology (&quot;I didn't realize that vase was so important to you, I'm sorry&quot;), perfect bribe (&quot;Would you let me in if I promised you a bottle of 14-year-old scotch?&quot;), perfect reality check (&quot;What would your children think if they saw you now?&quot;), etc.</p>
<p>If the relevant phrase is a lie, the caster will be aware of this and&nbsp;needs to roll a bluff check to deliver it (and may choose not to do so).&nbsp; If he does not have the perfect bribe, but can get it, he can always come back later when he is properly prepared.&nbsp; This&nbsp;power does not allow the caster to do what cannot be done; if there is nothing he could say to convincingly bribe a guard, for example, then the&nbsp;power fails.&nbsp; This power grants a +10 luck bonus&nbsp;to&nbsp;any associated Bluff, Diplomacy or Gather Information roll used with the information granted by this spell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purify the Afflicted</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: Concentration<br />
Range: Touch</p>
<p>By connecting with a Ley Line, an Adept can use this power to purge the lingering effects of poison and disease, as well as contact with lesser forms of undead.&nbsp; With a touch, the Adept can remove ability damage from the target in exchange for six points of Vitality per point of ability damage healed.&nbsp; By expending an additional six points, the Adept may also purge all diseases from the subject.&nbsp; This power cannot restore attributes lost to ability drain, unless an ability score has been drained to zero, in which case any attribute can be raised to 1 at a cost of six Vitality for the Geomancer.&nbsp; Each victim restored through this power costs the Ley Line one point of Essence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shared Prophecy</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Adept<br />
Casting Time: One full round.<br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: 1 hour.<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Save: Will negates<br />
<br />
Using this power, an Adept can impart prophecy to another person.&nbsp; The Nomads typically use this ability to share their gifts with outsiders who wish to learn their ways.&nbsp; This power can be harmful to the minds of those unfamiliar with Geomancy.&nbsp; During the duration of this power, the Geomancer can freely attempt to access Prophecy by using the Geomancy skill, and any prophecies he receives will be shared with the target of this power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Master Powers</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Cure Mystic Ailment</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Master<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range: Touch</p>
<p>This power is similar to Cure Illness, but applies even to magical diseases such as Mummy Rot and Warp Touch, as well as magical poisons, causing them to disappear immediately.&nbsp; This can prevent poison from dealing its secondary damage.&nbsp; Unlike Cure Illness, this power will restore attributes that have been drained as well as damaged, but only restores them to 1 in any event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enchantment Alteration</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Master<br />
Casting Time: 1 hour<br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: 24 hours<br />
Target: Two masterwork items, at least one of which must be magical.</p>
<p>When invoked, this power allows the Geomancer to take the enchantment from one item and place it into another.&nbsp; The Geomancer performs a ceremony over both items, and over the course of the next 24 hours, the enchantment switches from one item to the other.&nbsp; If both items are enchanted, the enchantments switch places.&nbsp; If only one is enchanted, the magical item becomes masterwork and the other item becomes magical.&nbsp; Items switched must fill the same 'slot' or this power fails.&nbsp; A helm cannot, for example, be enchanted to be +2 and flaming burst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purification</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level: Master<br />
Casting Time: 1 full round.<br />
Component: Ley Line<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range: Touch</p>
<p>After connecting to&nbsp;a Ley Line, a&nbsp;Master Geomancer&nbsp;can restore any affliction short of death with a touch.&nbsp; By expending twelve Vitality, the Master may choose any of the following effects:&nbsp; Cure all ability damage; cure one ability of all Ability Drain, remove all Negative Levels, cure all magical and mundane diseases or poisons, restore lost limbs, or restore all of the character's wound damage.&nbsp; Multiple effects can be chosen, but the Master pays twelve vitality for each such effect.&nbsp; The Master is aware of every affliction he can heal using this power when he touches the subject, and may choose at that time how to use this power.&nbsp; Using this power costs the Ley Line&nbsp;five points of Essence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second Guess</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Prophecy<br />
Level:&nbsp;Master<br />
Casting Time: Immediate Action<br />
Component: Quake<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Range:&nbsp;Personal</p>
<p>Using this power, a Geomancer can reflexively tap into his gift of prophecy and receives a flash of insight regarding his current situation.&nbsp; He may immediate reroll any check to obtain knowledge about his current situation, including Sense Motive, Perception, or Knowledge.&nbsp; He receives a +10 bonus on this second roll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Luminary&nbsp;Powers</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Breath of Life</strong></p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;Purity<br />
Level:&nbsp;Luminary<br />
Casting Time: 1 day<br />
Component: Nexus<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Target:&nbsp;One dead creature.</p>
<p>At a nexus, a Luminary can break the barrier between life and death, though at great cost.&nbsp; By meditating within the Nexus for a full 24 hours, the Geomancer can tap the full energy of the Nexus to call the target's soul back into their body.&nbsp; Damage is fully restored and the soul repaired, meaning that the character arises at their full ability scores, and regains any levels lost due to level drain.&nbsp; This power will also restore lost limbs.&nbsp; At the culmination of this power, the Nexus itself swells, and then the energy drains out into the target.&nbsp; The Nexus thereafter loses the ability to empower any other Geomancy ability for 24 hours.&nbsp; People may still refresh, but any other powers that require a Nexus cannot be used; enchantment of items halts.&nbsp; Quakes caused by this effect are always significant, but the circumstances surrounding the death are believed to influence their strength.&nbsp; The specifics are a matter of debate, especially since this power is rarely performed.</p>
