        <p>&nbsp;<meta charset="utf-8" /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">Joesph was stunned after the events at the Super Nexus(for lack of a better name), not only did he now have the first lead on a way to maybe help Anne, but he had learned what happened to the humans of this realm, and met more gods than any mortal has a right to.&nbsp; Even after most of the others left, Joepsh stayed and studied the facility best he could.&nbsp; He also questioned Anne as to the nature of her relationship with the Raven Queen.&nbsp; However, she was evasive on the subject, only telling him that she wishes to speak with him.&nbsp; Worse, she got noticeably grumpier when he told her he didn't know if it was a good idea or not.<br /><br />Whatever her relationship with the Raven Queen was, it had colored her.&nbsp; And why did that mark suddenly show up on her body?&nbsp; No, the more pressing matter was his sickness that he had infected himself with.&nbsp; The Pseudo-natural taint was still gnawing at him, like a mouse nibbling at a chair leg.&nbsp; He didn't know how long it would be before he might lose himself.&nbsp; The demons he had consumed were...helping.&nbsp; But in a different way.&nbsp; An opposite way if that made any sense.&nbsp; Perhaps it was there link to the nexus's.&nbsp; A devil or demon seems to thrive on this Negative Essence, while these Pseudo-natural creatures were orcs that had been oversaturated in Positive Essence.&nbsp; If they are indeed two halves of the same coin, it might be possible to learn to control these infections and perhaps gain some insight into their nature.<br /><br />The plan was simple enough, but it was also dangerous.&nbsp; After convincing Anne to try and hold him back from the edge, Joesph set up a rune circle that he had found allowed him greater control over his odd powers.&nbsp; It placed him into a dream-like trance where time was subjective, but it gave him the best chance of success.<br /><br />First, Joesph carefully separated his only remaining undead passenger, the Frost Giant.&nbsp; The circle shifted as hundreds of intricate symbols blossomed into a connected circle with a strong dark essence at the center.&nbsp; Now Joesph as alone with the demons and his own infected essence.&nbsp; He passed deeper into the trance.&nbsp; Going slowly, Joesph seperated a small piece of himself from the embattled war within.&nbsp; He could feel that piece grow stronger in its taint as he did, until finally it had become...other.&nbsp; He could feel the deadness of emotion and alienness of the taint, and it moved to infect the rest of him.&nbsp; Now the trick would be to get it under control.&nbsp; To learn how to selectively pacify this piece of himself.&nbsp; He drew on the demonic taint to battle it, paying attention to how the demons fought their war.&nbsp; Over time he learned how to use the negative energy to contain and pacify the pseudo-natural nature, but also how to protect it from the opposite essence.&nbsp; However this measure would be a temporary gesture, he must completely redesign some of the runes on his body to keep that piece separate as a sort of...starter or battery of the taint.&nbsp; Joesph pulled himself out of the trance to find several hours had passed.&nbsp; He grabbed his inks and began sketching his designs on his stomach in smooth unnatural curves and almost maddening designs.&nbsp; When he was finished he could almost feel the positive taint stretch out in its new home.&nbsp; Now that part of the Pseudonatural essence was 'protected', came the most dangerous part.&nbsp; Fusing with the demons and gaining control of their essence without being overpowered.&nbsp; Anne looked at Joesph with his own fear mirrored back.&nbsp; Dropping back into the trance, Joesph crushed the remaining essence of one of the demons, but then devoured the other.&nbsp; The demonic taint flowed through Joepsh's body, burning as it did.&nbsp; Every sensation felt stronger then the last, and Joesph could feel the lingering positive taint be cleared away, all except for the taint he had protected.<br /><br />The power felt incredible, and Joesph wanted the taint to take every part of him so he could revel in the sensations.&nbsp; Until he felt a very sharp jab at his subconscious in the form of a firm slap to the face by Anne.&nbsp; &quot;Joe!&nbsp; Don't go there!&nbsp; You won't come back!&quot; Anne cried out.&nbsp; Then she reached into his belly and gave fuel to the positive taint, and suddenly the emotions weren't controlling Joepsh as badly.&nbsp; &quot;T-thank you.&nbsp; Now give me a minute here.&quot;&nbsp; Joesph dropped into the trance, and now having experience with the Positive taint, used this knowledge to fight back the negative taint.&nbsp; He again seperated a piece of himself, and allowed it to convert totally.&nbsp; Again Joesph awoke and began drawing on his belly, the other half of his new tattoo.&nbsp; This time he used a darker red, and drew in sharp static lines and edges.&nbsp; The two drawings looked like raindrops that are ever chasing each other.&nbsp; Each sending out branches into the rest of his tattoos, but too busy fighting each other.&nbsp; And indeed when the separated section settled in, he could feel the essences begin to compete without being able to destroy each other or escape their prisons/shields.&nbsp; But before he could relax, Joesph dropped back into the trance.&nbsp; Using his new found control, Joesph burned away the remaining negative taint, and then sealed away the bickering essences.&nbsp; When Joesph emerged from his trance he felt more sane then he had in weeks, but could still feel the two taints at the corner of his mind.&nbsp; He examined the new large tattoo on his abs, it looked almost alive.&nbsp; Hopefully he made the right choice to embrace the essences rather then try and destroy them.&nbsp; He reabsorbed the Skeletal Frost Giant and the circle collapsed as he stood shakily.&nbsp; Anne was hovering a fair distance away, looking shy.&nbsp; &quot;Your...not mad at me are you?&quot; she asked, with hesitation in her voice.&nbsp; &quot;No, you did the right thing Anne, I had almost lost control.&nbsp; I couldn't have done this without you.&nbsp; But I think its time for some rest before I attempt the device.&quot;&nbsp; It was obvious he had been in the trance for longer then usual, as according to the stars that were out, over two days had passed.&nbsp; The longest was probably the purging of his system, and placing the preventative systems to keep from being reinfected if he uses the essences again.&nbsp; Joesph took out his bedroll and slept there in the center hollow of the room.<br /><br />As Joesph slept he was plagued by nightmares, mainly of losing control and becoming a hideous monster, but there were a few of being driven insane by the Raven Queen the moment he meets her.&nbsp; When he awoke it was mid-afternoon and he packed his gear.&nbsp; &quot;Are we going to see the Raven Queen now?&nbsp; She really wants to talk to you Joe!&quot; Anne pleaded.&nbsp; &quot;I don't know if we can trust her yet Anne, especially after those warnings.&quot; Joesph replied.&nbsp; &quot;She isn't bad!&nbsp; She just wants to talk!&quot; Anne said angrily.&nbsp; &quot;Look I don't even know where I would go, but for now I think some study in the Empire is in order.&nbsp; I could probably swing getting access to some of the 'real' libraries in the Capitol, if not some of the private libraries of the Dragon Rider.&nbsp; I promise you Anne, once I know more about the Raven Queen I will seek her out.&quot; Joesph said quietly.&nbsp; Entering the expansive nexus device Joesph again reveled at the sight.&nbsp; He stepped onto the runes and began attempting to send himself to meet with the Marquee of the west, the Dragon Tamer.<br /><br />As he 'fell' through the leylines, he felt the pseudonatural taint grow strong, but using the demonic taint against it he kept control barely.&nbsp; When he met with Dragon Tamer, he was allowed to study for the part he played, and was informed as to the positive outcome of the battle in the east.&nbsp; Heartened by this news, Joesph told the Marquee of what occured on the other side of the world, and what the gods had told them of what is to come.(he shared mostly the message rather then every little thing, but we can play around with what I told him).&nbsp; The Marquee was very interested in the news, and said that he would think on what to do with the information.&nbsp; But for now Joesph should keep it to himself.&nbsp; Agreeing, Joesph retired to the libraries and began his study.&nbsp; After a week of concentrated study into the Raven Queen, Joesph had learned much.&nbsp; It wasn't just Anne who had a connection to the Raven Queen.&nbsp; It was likely Joesph had one as well.&nbsp; The shadows that clung to him, the ability to step through shadows.&nbsp; If anything, it was through Joesph that Anne had met the Raven Queen.&nbsp; It might be that she knows more about his abilities then any other.&nbsp; However, it seemed that while she was often associated with winter, her true realm was both incredibly dangerous and not of this world.&nbsp; The Plane of Shadow is where she calls home, and her palace lies in the deepest part of that dangerous world.&nbsp; There were few reports of other planes, and none that Joesph had met other then gods could travel as they wished.&nbsp; However it was likely that he may have a strong enough connection to the Plane of Shadow that he could perhaps go and meet the Raven Queen as Anne wished.&nbsp; She grew steadily more anxious as time went on.&nbsp; However she had been paying more attention to the basic rune magic lessons Joesph had been giving.&nbsp; Now his research went in another route, searching for a ritual that might allow him to enter the plane of shadow.&nbsp; After another week of study and discussion with the court Rune Mages, Joesph was little closer.&nbsp; He had experimented several times with the Taints, but they did not offer a better option.&nbsp; He had read several reports of some forbidden literature.&nbsp; But it would be likely that only a Technoprophet city would hold such texts any longer.<br /><br />Joesph sent word to the Dragon Tamer of his pressing matters, that he would be searching out answers in Technoprophet lands.&nbsp; He would also try and keep an eye out for demonic troop deployment and the like.&nbsp; It took Joesph almost two weeks to travel to the nearest Technoprophet city without arising suspicion with a phantom steed or the like.&nbsp; It gave him time to teach more to Anne, and work on some spells of his own.&nbsp; Every night he would spend time trying to meditate, thinking about what he had read on the Raven Queen.&nbsp; She was both kind and callous, both salvation and damnation.&nbsp; She was also known to be associated with destiny and fate.&nbsp; This might explain why even the gods could not divine Joesph's past.&nbsp; However, all of this was simply hypothetical.&nbsp; Maybe Anne never met the Raven Queen at all, and is making it up.<br /><br />When he arrived it was worse then he thought.&nbsp; Those that needed refreshing were hurried in and out of the city.&nbsp; If it were not for his powers, he would not have succeeded in infiltrating the city.&nbsp; He absorbed one of the guards and took the mans image to sneak inside, but didn't burn him entirely.&nbsp; He waited for night to fall and took a risk shifting into one of the book repositories.&nbsp; Using his special qualities he was able to remain hidden during the day and study books at night.&nbsp; He found little without help of a librarian.&nbsp; One night he found a book detailing creatures capable of penetrating the veil, including description of the mount of Isaline.&nbsp; During his study of the texts he also read a mention of a grimoire of secrets of necromancy.&nbsp; While interesting, it was unlikely to be in this library.&nbsp; &quot;Why won't you talk to the lady?&nbsp; We should go right now!&quot; Anne said, materializing again.&nbsp; &quot;Just because I know a way to get there doesn't mean I could find her, or whether I would survive such a journey.&nbsp; There are a lot of interesting texts here that I should study while I have the chance.&quot; Joesph responded.&nbsp; &quot;...I knew you wouldn't listen to me.&quot; Anne muttered to herself.&nbsp; &quot;Look we will go as soon as I'm done...&quot; Joesph started.&nbsp; &quot;YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WANT!&quot; Anne suddenly screamed.&nbsp; The bookshelves around them suddenly were pushed and began a cascading collapse that even the empire would hear.&nbsp; &quot;Oh shit.&nbsp; Anne we can talk about this la-&quot; Joesph started when Anne yelled again.&nbsp; &quot;You're not listening!&nbsp; Your just ignoring me and hoping I forget!&nbsp; I have to stay with you so you think I'll just forgive you!&nbsp; Well I hate you!&nbsp; I'll never like you cause you the person who killed me!&quot;&nbsp; At this Joesph stumbled back.&nbsp; &quot;I...do you really feel that way?&nbsp; I'm...I'm so sorry Anne, I know I made a horrible mistake and I am just trying to help you-&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I don't care!&nbsp; You don't listen to me and you don't like me either, you just feel bad cause you killed me!&nbsp; And I'm stuck with you.&nbsp; But the Lady told me how to go away.&nbsp; And know what?&nbsp; I don't want to stay with you anymore!&nbsp; I'm going to talk to the Lady alone and you can just leave me alone!&quot;&nbsp; &quot;What?&nbsp; No wait a minute, thats not fai-OW!!&nbsp; What...what are you doing?!&quot;&nbsp; Joesph yelled.&nbsp; Inside his head he felt the bond to Anne tear apart.&nbsp; He could see her struggling through the pain as well, but he felt just as much shock from Anne's sudden tantrum.&nbsp; Anne screamed out as she struggled to leave Joesph's side, and suddenly disappeared from sight and perception.&nbsp; Joesph struggled not to black out from the sudden pain and emotional trauma from the damage.&nbsp; He could feel the link was still there, but it was weak.&nbsp; Over time it would fade.&nbsp; She had left.<br /><br />Joesph stumbled through the fallen books and splintered wood hearing the sound of people making their way to the commotion.&nbsp; He managed to shift to a building outside before anyone could get close and started making his way to the walls of the city.&nbsp; He tried to consume the guard he had taken, but without concentration he could not manage.&nbsp; In fact he didn't know how long he'd be able to go without passing out.&nbsp; The city passed in a blur as he stumbled through the streets, oddly devoid of people.&nbsp; He didn't notice the dark figures until they stepped out of the shadows and as one hit him with binding spells.&nbsp; He quickly passed out as his body was racked with pain.<br /><br />Joesph didn't wake up, or rather was not allowed to wake up for several days.&nbsp; When he did, he felt odd, and soon saw why.&nbsp; They had prepared a special room for him, it was designed to seal Rune magic.&nbsp; Even the bindings on his body had disrupting runes drawn on them.&nbsp; The room was also very well lit.&nbsp; A dark older woman entered the room.&nbsp; &quot;Ah... welcome to conciousness Joesph Vernor.&nbsp; We have wanted to meet you for quite a long time, and then you suddenly destroy a quarter of a book repository and then stumble through the streets moaning.&nbsp; Rather then playing a little cat and mouse game however, I think its best if I tell you why your here.&nbsp; You have the key to withering, and we want it.&nbsp; And we will get it anyway we can.&quot;&nbsp; With that she began asking questions, and when Joesph would lie, or just give her an answer she didn't like there would be pain.&nbsp; Sometimes they wanted to see what he could do, but under very controlled circumstances.&nbsp; Eventually they started trying to take him apart while he was working.&nbsp; And then they started just using him to unwither those who paid for the service.&nbsp; At first he was angry and he fought, but it started boiling down to waiting.&nbsp; Waiting for them to make a mistake.&nbsp; When they would leave him be at night, he would plan, and then he would pray.&nbsp; Pray for the Raven Queen to keep Anne safe, and to help him bring death to they who extend their lives.&nbsp; He hoped that Anne might someday understand, and might return to him.&nbsp; If not he hoped she might have found her final rest.</span></p>      </div>
