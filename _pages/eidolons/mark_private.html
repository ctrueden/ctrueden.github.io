At least as far as he can tell.&nbsp; He remembers existing.&nbsp; But those memories aren't his.&nbsp; Well, he thinks their not his.&nbsp; 4 years ago there was a massive quake in the middle of the wasteland, far from any Nexus.&nbsp; And at the epicenter of this quake, appeared Joe.&nbsp; The experience was traumatizing, as he last remembered kissing his girlfriend in the alley of his hometown when the alterations happened.&nbsp; He was lucky there was a band of Nomadic creatures nearby, they helped him get his bearings.&nbsp; He'd seen the other races before, but his town consisted of mostly Humans, and all evidence of its existence had vanished around him.&nbsp; That, or it had never existed.&nbsp; Joe now was fairly certain he was an odd creation of the flux, complete with memories of his life before.&nbsp; However those memories didn't feel right, not as real as the memories he made everyday.&nbsp; His memories of his family and friends barely registered to him.&nbsp; He didn't miss them much.&nbsp;</p> <p>The only person who was different was Jessica Reynolds.&nbsp; He remembered she was the only one like him, with magic that is.&nbsp; The first time he kissed her, the quake happened and he couldn't reach her before she vanished in front of him and he got thrust into the world at large.&nbsp; Even now, the memories of her feel real, and he desperately wants to find her.</p> <p>Joe left the Nomads at the first Nexus they encountered.&nbsp; It was there he discovered that despite his withering, the nexus was not working on him like it did for the others.&nbsp; With this revelation, many of the residents of the small town started avoiding me, afraid of catching whatever it was that ailed me.&nbsp; It wasn't until an elderly Rune Mage stopped in the town that things changed.</p> <p>Jrathal had spent far too much time away from a Nexus, having been the prisoner of an Orc band until recently.&nbsp; The aged Dragonborn had studied magic for over a hundred years, but he had never heard of a human before.&nbsp; His curiousity in me led to letting me join him as an page, to help him now that his disability made taking care of himself more difficult.&nbsp; He also allowed me to study his texts, and I slowly came to understand magic.</p> <p>However, I soon discovered my magic was NOT ordinary.&nbsp; I soon discovered I could do things with magic that Jrathal could not, namely spirit manipulation.&nbsp; I could also somewhat manipulate the effects of withering.&nbsp; But it wasn't until last year that I discovered how dark my powers really were.</p> <p>I had begun experimenting with my control over withering, and I was freely wandering the slums of one of the larger cities.&nbsp; Jrathal had taken an apprentice and settled down, and I still spent most of my time caring for the man.&nbsp; I had been building up a relationship with the orphans in the slums, children who had even less time remaining to them then I had.</p> <p>There was a little girl I met named Anne, and the poor girl was more withered then Jrathal at the age of 5.&nbsp; Her white hair was long, reaching the tips of her fingers, and she hid her withered face in her tresses.&nbsp; I had been bringing her food, and trying to reverse the effect of her wither, but beyond a superficial alteration nothing changed.&nbsp; One afternoon however, she was doing worse then usual, and in my panic to ease her pain, I 'pushed' myself into her.&nbsp; Her wither reversed!&nbsp; For the first time since I'd known her, if not for her still stark white hair she looked like a 5 year old child again.&nbsp; However I soon felt the side effect of the treatment.&nbsp; I looked on my hands as I now withered closer to death in her place.&nbsp; I didn't want to die before I found Jessica!&nbsp; By the time I'd realized what I was doing, I'd grabbed the estatic Anne and tried to take back what I'd given.&nbsp; Her sudden fear soon changed to panic, as she felt her body withering again.&nbsp; It felt...so good!&nbsp; Like I was drinking pure life.&nbsp; I felt my original state return, but I went further.&nbsp; Anne started to cry, but soon she only had the strength to whimper.&nbsp; I kept going, until all I held in my arms was a pile of dust.&nbsp; I felt better then I did the day I stepped into this world.&nbsp; But once the rush of life was gone, I fully realized what I'd done.&nbsp; Her clothes were all that remained of her, and her cries had summoned the other children, but when I looked up at them they fled in terror.</p> <p>I threw up until I was simply dry heaving, and I didn't stop shaking for 3 days.&nbsp; The city was up in arms, they said they had a Necromancer in their midst, and I was terrified.&nbsp; I started to sense things on the border of my perceptions, the dead.&nbsp; But one in particular stood out to me.&nbsp; It was Anne.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked just as she had before I'd sucked her life away, wearing her tattered little dress.&nbsp; At first she was hazy, indistinct, but soon she looked as real as the nose in front of my face.&nbsp; And she followed me.&nbsp; But she never said a word, simply watching me with a sad look on her face.&nbsp; It was two weeks later that I screamed at her, "Leave me be!".&nbsp; She disappeared for 3 days.&nbsp; It wasn't until I called her name that she reappeared.&nbsp; "Why are you following me?&nbsp; I'm sorry, I didn't mean to kill you." I said to the ghost.&nbsp; I expected nothing, but she averted her gaze and looked uncomfortable.&nbsp; Then I saw she was trying to mouth words to me.&nbsp; It seemed I could not hear her, so I stepped closer and bent in.&nbsp; She then walked closer to me and looked around as though afraid of another listener.&nbsp; She bent in and whispered into my ear, I could barely hear it, "there is another here, beware".&nbsp; She then froze and started as she whirled toward a figure now standing in the corner of my room.</p> <p>There was a male Dwarf covered in bone armor, holding a staff seemingly made of a spine and a pelvis, shrouded in the shadows of my room like they were his cloak.&nbsp; "You have a lot of nerve.&nbsp; I could excuse an amatuer for not recognizing the wards I placed, and accidentally overstepping his bounds.&nbsp; But the power you used the other night was something even I can't do.&nbsp; Who the hell are you?" the figure asked, in a dark voice.&nbsp; "I'm noone, what happened the other night was an accident.&nbsp; I...I didn't do anything." I stuttered to the figure.&nbsp; "Lies.&nbsp; But your power IS intreguing.&nbsp; Your bones should make a fabulous spell component for wither magic..." the figure muttered while waving his hand at me.&nbsp; As he did, runes on his bone armor glowed and disappeared, and out of the floor whips made of spines wrapped around me.&nbsp; I was being pulled into the infinite darkness of the ground now, and it was all I could do to fighting.&nbsp; "I don't have all day." the figure said as he disappeared into the deep darkness.&nbsp; I could feel the end coming, and then I felt a cold hand on my face.&nbsp; Anne was standing there, looking into my eyes.&nbsp; I felt she was there for me, despite what I'd done.&nbsp; I had to fight this.&nbsp; "Dark Bolt!" I cried, and expended my only rune to blast open one of the bone tentacles.&nbsp; I reached out with my free hand and grasped Anne's.&nbsp; I felt her essence fill me, and suddenly the tentacles flew through my body as if it were air.&nbsp; I heard the enemy Necromancer sputter curses and begin preparing a new spell.&nbsp; With that I hightailed it out of there, running through the walls as if they were not in the way.</p> <p>It was a week before I stopped for more than a day.&nbsp; In that time I'd learned more about what I'd done.&nbsp; Somehow, I had used the abilities of an undead ghost's intangibility.&nbsp; Somehow I had empowered the ability enough to even slip free of enchanted bonds.</p> <p>Months later, I still had not learned who had attacked me, but I had a feeling it wouldn't be the only time I met him.&nbsp; Next time I would be ready.</p> <p>Recently I had caught a lead on my attacker, meeting a fellow human in this huge city.&nbsp; He however had withered greatly, and was shunned by others.&nbsp; He had appeared several years before I had, but had heard of this Bone Wizard.&nbsp; He told me he would speak to me in the morning, so I retired to my inn and spent my time refining my necromatic runes and communing with Anne.

Where she is, and what she is doing is unknown, but their bond is strong and it is just a matter of time before they find each other again.</p> <p>Enemies-</p> <p>5 pt enemy-The Dead Artificer's</p> <p>The rumor of these dark wizards has existed for hundreds of years, one is a dwarf who fashions masterwork magical weapons and armor from the bones and flesh of his enemies.&nbsp; He is a skilled warrior, who also uses necromancy through his twisted artifacts.&nbsp; His partner is a gnome artificer, whose specialty is not just raising armies of the undead, but trying to invent new and more powerful forms of the undead.&nbsp; He has an army of necromatic golems and perhaps a number of twisted warforged at his command.&nbsp; He prefers to do the fighting from a distance, using numerous spells to disable his foes without damage, to easier use their bodies for his experiments.</p> <p>They were the bane of the ancient kingdoms for over 200 years, until they faced the combined armies of several city-states.&nbsp; The battle was chaotic, but their lair was laid to waste and presumably they were killed.</p> <p>However, they had actually escaped during the battle, and fled to the wastes to avoid their enemies.&nbsp; They decided to lay low and build their power in the shadows, while taking this opportunity to study the undead in the wastes.</p> <p>It wasn't until a very strange necromancer stumbled into his powers, attracting the attention of the Dwarf.&nbsp; Investigating the source, he was suprised by the abilities of the young necromancer.&nbsp; Normally he would've hunted down this enticing individual, but strangely the boy could not be detected by normal spells.</p> <p>Normally the desire to take Joesph apart would not be enough to force the two to leave their hiding place, but since he has discovered their existance they believe he is a serious threat to the safety of their project.&nbsp; As they learn more about his powers though, he may become an even bigger target.&nbsp; Maybe even worth coming out of retirement for.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>3 pt enemy-The Necromancers of Arx</p> <p>[[While Joesph would never do something as silly as introduce himself or even talk to his targets of withering, Necro Joe is the nickname he's come up with for his alter-ego.&nbsp; Because of his odd moral compass, he specifically targets those who abuse their gift of seemingly eternal life.&nbsp; Many of these targets include rich and powerful individuals, or the men and women who work for these sorts of people.&nbsp; Some are small time crime bosses operating in the wastes, and others are powerful nobles traveling through.&nbsp; If their crime is light, he only leaves them partially withered, often taking one or two of the guards who get in his way.&nbsp; Those who are 'more' deserving get the whole treatment, and are absorbed as undead minions.&nbsp; While many of his targets will never have a tear shed for them, some have had bounties put on his alter-ego's head.&nbsp; The more powerful have sent men after him personally.&nbsp; This means that Necro Joe has a great number of enemies looking for him.&nbsp; However, because of his nature, none have gotten accurate physical descriptions.&nbsp; When targeting individuals, he wears a long black cloak, and a full helm which throws what little could be seen of his face into shadow.&nbsp; Because of this, Joesph has been able to go in and out of the towns and cities of the wastes without much trouble, as many are looking for a necromancer.&nbsp; However, some of his enemies will be able to connect the dots, as his entering the city often coincides with the appearance of Necro Joe.&nbsp; Its only a matter of time before trouble finds Joesph unprepared.</p><p>Addendum: Specifically, Joesph has made many enemies from his first serious attempt at withering an evil man.&nbsp; He had heard of an evil noble who lived in Arx, and still feeling guilty about Anne snuck into the city and withered the man to within an inch of turning completely.&nbsp; It was all Joesph could do to stop before absorbing him, but the man litterally had minutes before he would turn.&nbsp; Joesph left the man screaming, and escaped out of the city that night.&nbsp; The only person who survived to see his face was the noble, but it was likely he turned before telling anyone.&nbsp; At least thats what Joesph tells himself to feel safe.&nbsp; Its likely that the Arx nobles are very interested in an ability like his, and are likely the primary force behind those who would kill/kidnap Joesph.&nbsp; Whether this means the nobles in the parties an enemy of Joesph is yet to be discovered.]]</p><p>After being captured and studied by Arx, he has attracted the very real attentions of some of its worst number.&nbsp; These powerful necromancers want the powers he weilds, and now that they have gotten a taste of him, he must suffer their interests.(pending approval)</p>      </div>
