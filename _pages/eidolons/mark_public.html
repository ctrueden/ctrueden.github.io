<p>A human in a world devoid of his race, with memories not his own, some might notice that his race is only the start of the strange things about him.</p> <p>He wears a travelers cloak over his simple robes, and is strangely pale.&nbsp; He has black hair and grey eyes, and oddly shadows seem to cling to him even during mid-day.&nbsp; However, despite his odd appearance, he is a friendly person.&nbsp; While he is not a greatly accomplished Runemage, few have heard of his deeds, he has spent a number of years working as an escort for caravans in the wastes.&nbsp;&nbsp; He tends to keep a low profile, and does not often talk of his past.&nbsp; But in the wastes this is nothing strange, certainly not stranger then his species.</p><p>For those that have seen Anne she appears to be a 5-6 year old elven girl, with very long(waist-length) hair.&nbsp; The hair is stark white, though its hard to tell through a ghosts normal ghostlieness.&nbsp; Her hair covers her cute face, but its likely she can alter her appearance a small amount.&nbsp; She also often appears to be wearing baggy clothes, which when a closer look is attempted seem fairly dirty.&nbsp; She also appears wearing a oversized dress, all balled up at her feet, but this only seems to happen when she is in a good mood.</p>      </div>
