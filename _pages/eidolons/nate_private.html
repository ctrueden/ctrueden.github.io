The runes bothered me.  It burnt my eyes to look upon them, but I thought that was just the inherent strength of their magic.</p> <p>It took many tries, but eventually we had managed to have me refresh with the heart of the nexus with out any of the pain refreshing with a nexus normally involves for me.&nbsp; Presuming the pain is caused by the racial connections I inherited from my dad, with some implements and magic we should be able to make refreshing available to him.</p> <p>Kas joined us in this work.  I wonder if Father had ever realized how intimate Kas and Myself had become.  She was a strong and talented woman, and my Father knew this.  We were the only people he trusted to help him with this work.  If the circle had known the work we were doing we would have been stopped.  Only Mother had clue what was going on, and for the love of my father she turned a blind to it even helped us stay under the radar.</p> <p>We knew all five members of the Yew Circle were in the city that day.  One would think it was a risky time to enact our experiment, but it was better we knew where they were than not have a tab on all of them at once.  In hindsight, Father wanted them all there.  He wanted them all taken care of immediately.</p> <p>We made our way to the nexus glen and prepared the spot as needed.  I traced out the diagram we had designed and then placed the implements at their respective spots.  Meanwhile, Kas and Father withdrew the heart of the nexus.&nbsp; As Father held the heart there in his hands the look in his eye was like nothing I had seen before.&nbsp; A darkness fell, and I was met with worry.</p><p>Kas and Father diviated from the ritual.&nbsp; Kas plunges her sword into the heart of the Nexus</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dread Fortune</span></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>A Mother's Love</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><em>I awoke to see Mother standing above me.</em></span></p><p>She stood there above me a shadow choking the light of the moon.&nbsp; Her pale white glowing eyes a grand glory compared to Luna's gasps.&nbsp; She wore a dark flowing dress that looked to spill in to the shadows and her hair flew up in the cold nite wasteland breeze.&nbsp; Fochlucan was distant, it's nexus no longer visible, no longer lighting the sky.&nbsp; The fair beacon of safety had been smothered and killed.</p><p>"My son."</p><p>"Mother!!?&nbsp; It worked then, but what has become of Dad."</p><p>"Corrupted, a lich.&nbsp; Seeing the flow and its tides, he saw your precious destiny and wanted it for himself."</p><p>"My destiny?"</p><p>"It is for you to untie the world.&nbsp; He planted the seed of your undoing here on your chest," she point to the desicated hand print over Sahrit's heart, "but it goes both ways.&nbsp; Embrace it and greatness will be your's to take."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>&nbsp;Timeline:</strong></span></p> <p>-27 Vance found by Paimon at ~23 years of age</p> <p>-24 Paimon and Vance marry</p> <p>-20 <span style="color: #00ccff;">Paimon Dies of mysterious circumstances.</span>&nbsp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Evil" Born, Paimon "dies in labor."</span></p> <p>-19 Vance marries Sophia.</p> <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span>-18 </span><span style="color: #00ccff;">"Good" born</span></span></p> <p>-5 Sahrit and Vance begin project to make Vance "able to refresh."</p> <p>-3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Evil" suggests giving up on refreshing and instead studying how to take advantage of withering.</span></p><p>-2 Sahrit succeeds in refreshing without suffering the normal pain through an unstable fluxuation of Nexus energies.</p> <p>-1 Event</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"PCs"</span></strong></p><p><strong>Barnabas:</strong> Formerly Promethero Fochlucan's animal companion.&nbsp; He helped Sahrit escape Fochlucan through the onslaught of undead left in the wake of Vance leaving the city.&nbsp; Barnabas is not yet completely aware of Sahrit's nature, but soon will be when he aquires an intelligence.&nbsp; Being Sahrit's <span style="color: #ff0000;">(step)</span>grandfather's pet they had played often when Sahrit was younger and are well aquanted.</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NPCs<br /> </strong></span></p>  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vecna"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vance</span></a><strong> Doubain:</strong> His Father, the "First Lich."&nbsp; A powerful rune mage and geomancer.&nbsp; Found one day in the wastes by Paimon and brought back to the Fochlucan College.&nbsp; Eventually gained membership to the college, though not traditionally trained.&nbsp; He married Paimon and, after her death Sophia.&nbsp; As an enemy, Vance is looking to use Sahrit to his own ends, though what those ends are is a mystery as of yet.</p><p>"Vecna I am come to take me rightful place on your throne."</p> <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paimon">Paimon</a> Elsa-Doubain:</strong><em>Align</em>: CN <em>Eyes</em>: White <em>Hair</em>: Black <em>Gender</em>: F</p><p>"Evil's" mother, an Eladrin, first wife of Vance, and member of the Yew Circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; While pregnant, while refreshing, received a prophecy that the son of Vance will be a tool in the undoing of the world.&nbsp; She attempts to take her life along with the child.&nbsp; She succeeds though through magic and healing "Evil" survives in his timeline. "Evil" is told she dies in child birth.&nbsp; "Good" barely hears about her except in hushed whispers and rumors.&nbsp; Vance has tried in vane to resurrect her, and only manages to do so with the power of the Lich ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since her resurection she&nbsp; has gone for what any can tell is insane.&nbsp; As an ally, Paimon acts as a guide and protector to Sahrit.&nbsp; As and enemy, she meddles and hinders the son that was not hers.</p><p>"My child shall take back his rightful destiny!"</p> <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(wisdom)">Sophia</a> Fochlucan-Doubain</strong><strong>:</strong><em>Align</em>: NG <em>Eyes</em>: Deep Blue <em>Hair</em>: Blonde <em>Gender</em>: F</p><p>"Good's" mother, an elf, second wife of Vance, and now de-facto leader the the remnants of the Fochlucan College.&nbsp; As an ally she makes her resources available to Sahrit.&nbsp; As an enemy, she uses her resources against Sahrit to hinder his plans.</p><p>"Sahrit, you are more than these circumstances; you can rise above what your father has done."</p> <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kas_the_Bloody-Handed">Kas</a> Azazil:</strong><em>Align</em>: NE <em>Eyes</em>: Otherworldly Green <em>Hair</em>: Blue <em>Gender</em>: F</p><p>Father's "research assistant".&nbsp;&nbsp; In actuallity, she is his imp familiar disguised as an elven member of the Lyrists.&nbsp; Turned against Vance after the ritual for breaking some unnamed deal. She acts more like a succubus than an imp and is uncommonly powerful for an imp, prolly char lvls and MP.&nbsp; She and Sahrit were intimately involved before the ritual occured.&nbsp; As an enemy, she is playful with Sahrit, regarding him as an equal that happens to always be 2 steps behind.&nbsp; Her agenda is unknown, but she is at odds with Sahrit and Vance, who are at odds with eachother.&nbsp; She is not unlikely to ally with Sahrit to take down Vance, but even then she is prone to turn on Sahrit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Yew Circle</span></p> <p><strong>Promethero Fochlucan:</strong> Renowned Elven bard and founder of the Fochlucan College.&nbsp; In disagreement with the Technoprophets and the Nomads, he wandered off into the wastelands in a self-imposed exile to find his own solution that did not involve the fatalism of the Nomads nor the over-analyzing and over-artificing of the Technoprophets.&nbsp; He found a lush and strong nexus and took it for himself from a tribe of kobolds and built a home for himself there which soon became the Fochlucan College.</p><p>"Are we to stand by and let fate decide the course of history?&nbsp;

She followed Promethero out in to the wastelands much to his protest.&nbsp; A powerful druid in her own right, she is responsable for the protection of the college from the hordes of the wasteland.&nbsp; Under her call, creatures of the wild have gathered to the Folchulcan nexus/oasis for mutual protection.</p><p>"All of nature and all of life needs our help against the strife to come."</p> <p><strong>Evantane Desartia</strong>-<strong>Var'Bellit-Ban'Tora Dorasane the 15th</strong>:<strong> </strong><span style="font-size: smaller;"><em>Align</em>: CN <em>Eyes</em>: Orange <em>Hair</em>: Blue <em>Gender</em>: M</span></p> <p>Gnome defector from the Technoprophets during their formative years.&nbsp; He despises them for their acts of artifice and in particular hates Warforged, which he believes all to be an atrotious misuse and abuse of nexuses.&nbsp; He was overseer of the nexus and its magic item production.&nbsp; He doesn't hate magic items.&nbsp; What he hates is the Technoprophets over complication in craft.&nbsp; Strongly emphasizes simplicity in craft.&nbsp;</p><p>"A sword cuts and kills your enemy, not summon 12 knights from the Astral Sea to do it for you."</p><p><strong>Danstia Burso:&nbsp;

Defected from the empire after a crisis of faith.&nbsp; Only member of the Yew-Circle to survive.&nbsp; Since he has found a new faith in a god he calls the Bane of Darkness.&nbsp; Some think he has gone insane.&nbsp; Some think just because he is insane doesn't mean he's wrong.&nbsp; A few weeks after the events he disappeared with out a trace.</p><p>"My eyes are open now.&nbsp; I see it all laid out before me.&nbsp; The darkness is coming, and we must make of the light sword, sling, and arrow to gaurd ourselves from it.&nbsp; The light may no longer have time to comfort us, but now wielded in our hands, it will be our greatest protector."</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Artifacts:</span></p> <p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Vecna">Eye of Vecna</a>:</strong> Gives a number of vision and gaze attack based abilities, though is not limited to these.&nbsp;
