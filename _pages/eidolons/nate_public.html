<p>Under Con(De)struction</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Sahrit is easily mistaken for an Eladrin/Elf half breed.&nbsp; He is too short for and Elf, too tall for an Eladrin.&nbsp; He has soft glowing eyes with fairly visible irises and pupils, though they glow a pure white, an uncommon color for Eladrin, even half-breeds, such color glow is more often due to nexus over-consumption.&nbsp; The accentuated features common in feykind are subdued on him.&nbsp; The light presence of facial hair suggests possible dwarf blood, but his build would disagree.&nbsp; Any one with familiarity could pick out his human heritage, but ppl like that are few and far between.</p><p>He is dressed in the forest nuetrals of beaten leather and washed out greens, with the dirt worn expression of one who rarely leaves the road, except to go where the roads don't take you.&nbsp; His dirty blonde hair is long to just below his shoulders with sun faded streaks.&nbsp; The color of his eyes is difficult to make out behind the soft glow, but their lack of darkness suggests blue, grey, maybe a light green.&nbsp; His leather armor bears an embossed forest motif, scratched, worn, and betrayed by the nature of armor.&nbsp; His cloak, bordered by a complex piece of embroidered vine and knotwork, is frayed and worn thin in places.&nbsp; These things look like they were very nice things once, but time, use, and abuse have had their way with them.&nbsp;</p><p>At his hips are a beautiful mithral scimitar  adorned with the crescent symbol of Corellon on the pommel and an exquisitely designed dark wood lute.&nbsp; On his back is a darkwood shield embossed with the image of Obad-Hai which seems immune to the wear that has been placed upon his armor.&nbsp; These items look either immune to the rigors the rest of his equipment has been exposed to or simple cared for above and beyond reason.</p><p>Though often amiable, he tends to keep distant from others and keeps himself unapproachable.&nbsp; Some who've seen him enough describe him as erratic and often absent-minded at times.&nbsp; Others, will tell you he always wanders, misfortune constantly chasing at his heels.&nbsp; A black bear he calls Barnabas is almost always at his side, clad in mithral armor.</p></blockquote>      </div>
