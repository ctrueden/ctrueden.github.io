He will approach the creature, not as a rival, not as a subject, but as a potential ally in the fight against the demonic hordes. He will join the Vanquisher, fighting in the vanguard to strike at officers and lieutenants, bringing them a prime material Blood War. &quot;No mercy&quot; will be his war cry.</span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; border-collapse: collapse; ">At some point late in the year, the Vanquisher and Kith will be battling a demon lord of some power, Krazatheth the Loathsome, when they get separated from the army, which falls back to a defensive position when near to being overrun. At this point, seeing his battle lines compromised, the plan gone to hell, he scoops up the grig and they head to the pass, slaughtering whatever demons dare approach, and they ward the pass for two and a half hours, bunching up the enemy forces until the beleagered army can finish those out on the field and join their commander to seize the strategic position. Exhausted and bloodied, the two beings are carried to the back ranks to recover while the army, now in good order, finishes the assault. The event becomes known as Warder's Stand, and Kith is anointed Captain Warder (A new title) of his own squad of strikers, many of them fey.</span></p>      </div>
