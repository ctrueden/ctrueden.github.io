He knew that. No assassin could be; it was just part of the way you distanced yourself. And besides, some of the things he'd done...<br /> <br /> His latest mark was an old Gnomish inventor. Who knew why his employer wanted him dead? All <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> could determine was that his employer must be working for the empire in some capacity. The last mark, an elven maiden of... he couldn't tell ages, but the girl was young, had been a diplomatic attache to a liaison between one of the larger nomad tribes and Arboline, the one city that didn't make <span class="il">Kithlandil</span>'s flesh crawl when he entered. It was a nice city, as far as such things go. They'd made a conscious effort to be friendly to nature, and had considered the trees and the lay of the land and the ley of the land when constructing it. From the leather case he'd lifted off the elf's corpse, it was obvious they'd been discussing an alliance. <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> supposed his new mark was related to this alliance, or perhaps another. The empire couldn't bloody it's hands directly, of course, so his employer was scum who met him in an alley behind a tannery. He always smelled of urine and iron, which <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> did not like at all, but he paid well, and didn't ask for... trophies. <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> may be a murderer, but he was NOT a monster. One of these days, he supposed he'd have to trace his employer's connection back, but it didn't seem important right now. Who cared if the empire took over the world? What matter if this little alliance faltered or flourished? When you're drifting about half dead, all the colors tend to grey.<br /> <br /> In the century he'd been here, <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> had found plenty of time to adjust to this new environment. First had been relief, glorious relief. No more pain, agony, sorrow, fear. Then he discovered the landscape had changed. Not just geographically, but politically, socially, religiously, magically. No tree would accept him. No glade gave him welcome. He should have expected that, really. One does not defy a god and remain in good graces. Still.<br /> <br /> He flew up to the gnome's house, and lighted on a fence post, staring in one of the windows. It looked like a nice cozy little place. Probably had been in the family for generations. That made it easy to exploit. But where was the... Ahh. <br /> <br /> Every building had a weak point. He flew down toward the base of the door and pushed aside the flap, only to be met by a large, wet snout nuzzling out at him. <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> smiled and petted the dog gently. His voice soothing, he guided the dog out of the house and told him to stand watch. This was the only part of the job he hated. His employer would never know it, had no need to, but he despised deceiving these animals. It felt like an abuse of his power, but the dog was, after all, in the way. When he left, he'd open the gate. The dog would survive if it was smart. That was the way things went. <br /> <br /> He slipped inside the house quietly, moving aside the thick cloth to get a good look before continuing. No apparent magical alarms; it would have been annoying to key one to the dog. Good enough. He flew up onto a table and watched as the old man got himself ready for bed. Sitting on the edge of the table, <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> reflected that it must be much different and more difficult for larger people to do this job, though he knew they did. Being a grig had a lot of advantages in this line of work, not the least of which was that almost no one knew what he was. A quick glance around told him all he needed to know. He hopped to the end table while the gnome was straightening his pointy night cap, and dripped a few drops of poison into his cup. <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> prefered this poison. It was quiet, gentle. The gnome wouldn't feel anything, wouldn't gasp or cough or wheeze. He'd just go to sleep and then he wouldn't wake. He hopped back to the writing table and watched the old man go through an obvious routine. He removed a pair of rather fascinating mechanical jaws, set them on the end table, and took a drink from the glass, then laid in the bed, blew out the candle, and slept. <br /> <br /> <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> waited about fifteen minutes, then stood, and invoked faerie fire, coating the room with a soft green glow. As he searched the room, he found his mind wandering. Why, if Melora had forsaken him, was he still able to draw on the magic of nature. It seemed an obvious and final reconciliation of debt. He'd betrayed her. Why would she let him... But he didn't have an answer. It was important, but not knowable. True, he hadn't broken his oaths, but... it was strange. She wasn't even IN this world, which was more strange. He dug through some drawings on the old man's desk - apparently he had a granddaughter - and found what he'd been looking for. An invitation to a gathering of minds between those two peoples. Well, that was the final connection. Whatever it was he was doing, it was stopping this alliance. That information could be valuable, if <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> cared about that. And sometimes he did. <br /> <br /> <span class="il">Kithlandil</span> opened the gate while leaving the old man's property. Flying up and out, he studied the little hamlet from above. An ugly time for a frightened people. Or maybe not. He'd spent years - centuries? There was no way to know. But a long time, suffering in the realm of Grazzt. The demon prince had had a taste for betrayers, especially the beautiful fey folk. Kithrandil had watched brethren by the score and hundreds die or be subjugated and subverted. He'd survived by hardening his soul, remembering the betrayal of Melora. When finally Grazzt in his interminable conflicts was distracted, and Kithrandil with others had been rescued, he'd thought perhaps he'd been forgiven. But fate was cruel. <br /> <br /> It still hurt, the memory of the day he found that none knew her name. He had betrayed her, but he still loved her, even through the shell he'd built around his soul. Forcing the passion deep down again, he flew onward, toward the empire with clean hands and filthy bowels, to the foul smelling man with the money, toward no hope, no god, only withering and death.<br /> <br /> This is the briefest story; there's lots more, but I wanted to send something off that sets up a basic concept for you to yea, nay, or change. Basically, he's a grig, an assassin who labors for someone who thinks he's working for the empire. He's a druid by class, and deeply confused about how he came to be in this world, when the one he remembers was beautiful and vibrant. He betrayed his goddess, ended up in the abyss, and then here.</p> <hr /> <p>Pie.</p> <p>Anyway. On to five characters.</p> <p><strong>Araris Carmik:</strong> Araris was the young elven girl who first found the little grasshopper-like fey who staggered out of the horrors of the Abyss and fell unconscious with exhaustion and relief. She took him into her little hut with the green shutters, and put him in the cradle that she had once slept in herself. The poor girl rarely was able to spend much time with mother and father; they were busy in their own right, and left their child to fend for herself in the mostly safe region. The little girl dressed and nursed the worn grig, viewing him much like a doll given a semblance of life through magic. Through his extended lack of consciousness, she fed him carefully using an eyedropper with a solution of honey and warm water. When, to her absolute delight, he woke, he discovered himself NOT recaptured, but relatively safe and comfortable, Kithlandil let some of the iron resolve he'd forced into himself fade, and rejoiced in the benign nattering of a young girl. He began to let himself live again. In the days and weeks that followed, he paid attention to her lessons as well, and found himself thus educated in the basics of this new world, so different from his own. When he finally decided to leave, he promised himself and her that he would always look after her, and, to the best of his ability, he has.</p> <p><strong>Calvin Greedygoat Ballast Semil:</strong> Calvin was a gnome. A curious gnome. An inquisitive gnome. A gnome who'd never had a chance to interact with the fey folk before. He caught the recently rehabilitated Kithlandil in a trap well-hidden under some underbrush. When he checked the trap, hoping for the rabbit that had been so ravaging his garden, he was deeply surprised to find the grig in its place. With a promise of a bite to eat, the gnome led the wary grig to his home, and then grabbed him and shoved him in an iron cage. No amount of cursing in every unique tongue the wee fey could muster would compel the gnome to let him out. Calvin considered himself something of a scientist, and for the next several days studied his new captive's wings with an eye to manufacturing something similar. When he released Kithlandil to fit the iron-mesh wing coverlets onto him, the grig struggled mightily against the indignity, but the gnome was somewhat brawny, and affixed the device to his back nonetheless. Letting the grig go out, he watched as Kithlandil began to run and hop away, then begin to fly. Calvin let out a whoop of triumph as he watched the grig move at approximately three times his normal speed and slam himself into a tree, knocking himself silly. It was several hours later when Kithlandil came to, locked again in the cage. He watched Calvin silently hunched over his workbench for a long, long moment, then waited, quietly, until night. The grig then invoked his silence, slipped the thin iron pin he'd stolen from the contraption out of his shirtsleeve, and sprang the lock, after far too much time and effort. He slipped out and into the night, swearing vengeance should he ever meet the bastard again.</p> <p>It is late, I am tired, I'm going to give a shorter summary, and flesh these out later. Sorry.</p> <p><strong>Simonstraad Vilnes:</strong> Simonstraad was the dwarven police officer who first arrested the grig. They chatted some when he was imprisoned, and dropped oblique and subtle hints that there might be work for a shady sort if he'd go speak to:</p> <p><strong>Vurgot Gorimstrum:</strong> Vurgot was a halforc, and shady as they come. He arranged for the grig to get his first job, and persists in being a contact who Kith speaks with about work.</p> <p><strong>Glimdal Milstan:</strong> The Penderwydd of the circle Kith most found himself least unwelcome in. The ancient nymph was wise and fair, welcoming the grig like a lost lamb, recognizing something in him that he himself could not see. The only person who he thinks MIGHT have some of the information he seeks, if only he could get her to talk...</p>      </div>
