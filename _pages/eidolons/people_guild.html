        <p>The <strong>Guild of the Invisible Hand</strong> is an almost comically secretive organization composed of a network of thieves deemed trustworthy enough to enter.</p><p><strong>Power structure:</strong>&nbsp;The heart of the Guild is a group of doppelgangers called the <strong>Brethren</strong>. There are only 20 of them, and they share the same sentiments and goals, though they retain distinct personalities. The&nbsp;Guild has a leader called <strong>The One Who&nbsp;Remembers</strong>, the eldest of them&nbsp;(a druid/mimic).</p><p>Beneath him are lieutenants, one per major world culture, tasked with infiltrating that culture and learning its secrets. They are known as the Guildmasters, and at the moment there are four:&nbsp;one of the Empire, one of the Delphians, one of the Fey, and one of the Underdark. The One Who Remembers goes where the Brethren believe he would be most useful, which recently has been to the Wastes. He has been working with the Vanquisher (who does not know of the Guild)&nbsp;to unify the tribes, specifically as the real power behind the city of Ahote&nbsp;(at least three different personas in the city's leadership, who generally disagree with each other).</p><ul><li>Delphian Guildmaster &ndash; Silius Vartarra, high geomancer of Arx&nbsp;(runemage/geomancer) [GMs:&nbsp;see <a href="/eidolons/gm/red/2">Red 2</a> for details]</li><li>Underdark Guildmaster &ndash; Jerian Trizzel, agent in the Underdark's tiefling capital city&nbsp;(ranger/rogue)</li><li>Empire Guildmaster &ndash; Lyra Dragontamer, wife of Aras Dragontamer, Marquis of Niflheim&nbsp;(rogue/druid)</li><li>Fey Guildmaster &ndash; Glee Topun, beloved merchant and oracle who travels between the clans selling needed goods at reasonable prices&nbsp;(bard/druid)</li></ul><p>Beneath the lieutenants are the other fifteen Brethren, with each being assigned to one of the Guildmasters or to the One Who&nbsp;Remembers himself &mdash;so there are generally three Brethren working with each Brethren leader.</p><p>When one of the Brethren dies, the corresponding divine essence is freed, and a new Brethren can be made. Doing so requires the participation of all five Guildmasters.</p><p><strong>History:</strong>&nbsp;The main reason for the limit is that millennia ago, the goddess <strong>Melora</strong>&nbsp;(patron of shapeshifters and the natural world)&nbsp;was murdered by the other gods. Perhaps no living mortal remembers this event directly. However, when she died, her divine essence escaped, though it was shattered into 20 pieces. The essence shards somehow found its way to her most loyal followers, granting them supreme shapeshifting power. They were also granted an enduring vision of Melora's death from her eyes, so that they might always remember her fate, and feel the drive to avenge her.</p><p>In time, the Brethren decided to create an organization around them to assist with information gathering. Their overarching goal is to possess the power needed to strike down the gods themselves, and avenge Melora. Through extreme secrecy, the Brethren have managed to&nbsp;(as far as they know)&nbsp;keep the existence of the Guild&nbsp;(or at least its true scope)&nbsp;from the gods and their followers.</p><p>Over time, the Guild has become much more than a tool to defeat the gods. It is now composed of many mortal members, with oft-conflicting goals. The lower ranking members sometimes scheme against one another or get in each others' way, but the Brethren leverage their rank as needed to unify the Guild on important issues.</p><p><strong>One mind:</strong>&nbsp;The Brethren are united in common purpose&mdash;there is&nbsp;no dissent among them because the process of becoming one unifies your sensibilities.</p><p><strong>Guild rings:&nbsp;</strong>Each member of the Guild has a ring signifying his membership, normally invisible to all non-members. Guild members can see the rings of equal or lower-ranking Guild members. The Brethren's rings are more powerful, and convey the following powers:</p><ul><li>Teleport without distance restriction to any Guild member with a ring (1/day)</li><li>Mental communication with any other Guild member with a ring&nbsp;(at will)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit link:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>spirit link</em> is a technique usable only by the five Guildmasters. (They are all spirit linked to one another.) It is a standard action that links two people within 30 feet of each other, within close range (i.e., 25 ft. +&nbsp;5 ft./2 levels)&nbsp;of the invoker. The link lasts up to one day per three character levels. Those whose souls are linked are affected by each other in various ways, like <em>shield other</em> but more intensely. Damage dealt to one is also dealt to the other. A death effect against one may affect the other as well. If one is affected by a beneficial spell, the other may elect to be affected as well&mdash;for example, one <em>teleport</em> spell could affect both, regardless of distance.</p><p>There is also a <em>mass spirit link</em> ability, usable as a full-round action, that links all people within 30 feet of each other, also at close range. Silius Vartarra used this ability on an orc tribe, the Razortooth clan, to enable an army of orcs to teleport from&nbsp;Arx to Intempestivus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <p><u><strong>How the Guild learned of the Underdark<br /> </strong></u></p> <ul>     <li>Around 4,000 years ago, one of the Brethren infiltrated Arx.</li><li>However, he was exposed by the drow, who were also attempting to infiltrate the city at the time.</li>     <li>The drow ousted the &quot;fiend&quot; and made an alliance with the city; this is how House Tal'Arabep came into being.</li>     <li>As a result, the Brethren learned of the Underdark, and began to infiltrate it.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>The Failed Joining</strong></u></p><ul><li>There was once a man, deemed worthy to join the Brethren, but whose joining resulted in problems for them.</li><li>The joining resonated strangely with the existing Brethren, disrupting their minds and making rational thought difficult.</li><li>The man's link to the Brethren was unstable. Within a few days, the link was totally severed, the man disappeared and was never heard from again.</li><li>The remaining Brethren were relieved that the stability of their link was restored, and subsequently joined another worthy member into the fold, successfully.</li></ul>      </div>
