        <p>Kas is the avatar of St. Cuthbert.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>The Sword of Kas</strong></u></p><p>Kas temporarily aided Vance, to get in exchange help with research into making his sword; the sword was to be used to blacken the Heart, but to do this she imbued it with truly divine energy; she tried to use it when she betrayed Vance, and put out an eye, but did not manage to kill&mdash;Vance got away. The Sword did, however, absorb a certain amount of his divine essence, transforming it into a true artifact. That is, the Sword of Kas was not a true artifact until Kas stabbed Vance in the eye with it, and &quot;stole&quot; some of his essence into the Sword. This is also why it was able to strike at Tiamat. The Guild (i.e., Cameron)&nbsp;set the Sword to &quot;self-destruct&quot; after stabbing Peacekeeper, transferring the stored divine spark into St. Cuthbert. Tiamat is now rank 9, and Cuthbert is now 21.</p><p>All true artifacts possess some divine spark like this. During the War of the Gods, Boccob made some artifacts using essence from the slain gods, including one wand of each 9th level spell (?).</p><p>Most people couldn't make such a weapon; needs DR 20 deity assistance in creation</p> <p>After Cameron obtains the weapon, he gives it to Kith to use</p> <ul>     <li>Needs to stay embedded in the Emperor for some period of time to work</li>     <li>When the DR -1 damage is done, the weapon disintegrates; thus, it only continues to exist in worlds where that damage was never done</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p>      </div>
