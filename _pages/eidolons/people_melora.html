        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Melora's death<br /> </strong></span></p> <p>Melora opposes the imprisonment of Tharizdun initially. After it occurs, and the Lady of Pain has been bound, she has begun to observe the devastation caused to the land by the nexus phenomenon. She decides to share her findings with Boccob (who is Vecna at this point), because she thinks he'll be receptive. As a god of knowledge, Boccob knew of her coming in advance, and had already discussed the issue with many other gods. They agreed that she needed to be silenced. So the Lady of Pain was sent to be there at that time.</p> <p>Melora shows up, discusses it with Boccob briefly, and he informs her that unfortunately, the situation cannot be changed. The Lady of Pain emerges from the shadows and kills Melora. However, Melora is able to distribute her divine spark to her most ardent followers. Boccob was not expecting this, and is disappointed he could not absorb her power and steal her portfolio. (The Lady of Pain, secretly, was.)</p>      </div>
