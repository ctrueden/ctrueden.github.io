        <p>Kitsune are formless beings, often taking humanoid form to interact with others, but are also fond of appearing as elusive, multi-tailed foxes.</p>
<p>The kitsune are chameleons at heart, taking on temporary personae to fulfill needed roles in a group or community. They use their considerable skill at deception to become close to others, and convince them of the veracity of their assumed mantles. Once the bond between the kitsune and a victim becomes strong enough, the kitsune becomes capable of altering reality to grant the victim's secret wish (but not always in the way most desired by the victim&mdash;the kitsune may choose to subvert the intent or not).</p>
<p>As part of the reality altering process, the kitsune's ongoing lie becomes real, with a duplicate version of him coming into existence matching the persona. In this way, the kitsune is driven to &quot;breed.&quot;&nbsp;This new duplicate truly believes he is the person he appears to be, at least for a time. After a time, however, his interest in his companions fades and wanderlust sets in. Once he leaves the group, their belief no longer bolsters his persona, and he quickly forgets who he was, reverting to his default formless state, until he locates his next victim&nbsp;(which often may be the same group as last time, but with a new persona).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the original version of the kitsune leaves the group as well, looking for its next victim. It instinctively avoids contact with the newly formed duplicate, and unlike the duplicate almost always finds a new group or community to insinuate itself into before the duplicate's wanderlust sets in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Combat<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Kitsune are expert illusionists, avoiding combat when possible, and are rarely seen as anything but their assumed persona unless they wish to be. If threatened, they act according to their persona. When their persona is breached, they use their illusions to hide and fox fire to disorient their enemies. Few kitsune have the discipline to become wizards, and their poor Wisdom score make it hard to become a cleric or druid. Kitsune sorcerers are relatively common, but most become rogues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kitsune Traits</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Low-light vision: Kitsune can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, etc.</li>
    <li>Alternate Form (Su): As a standard action, a kitsune can change its form at will&nbsp;(but it is against its nature to &quot;break cover&quot; from its assumed persona except in extraordinary situations). This ability functions as a <em>polymorph</em> spell cast on itself at caster level equal to half its hit dice. The kitsune can remain in its current form until it chooses to assume a new one.</li>
    <li>Shippou-bi (Su): This works like the spell <em>dancing lights</em> for all kitsune. A kitsune of 7 HD and higher can use Fox Fire as an offensive weapon. This effect works like the spell <em>lesser orb of fire</em> from Complete Arcane p. 115 and can be used at will. If the target dies, their body is consumed in a 10-foot radius ball of fire. Every creature caught in the burst takes half the original damage on a failed save, or half of that on a successful Reflex save (DC 11 + kitsune's Charisma modifier).</li>
    <li>Illusions: This ability functions as the Trickery cleric domain in the Pathfinder Beta p. 185, replacing <em>disguise self </em>with <span style="font-style: italic;">silent</span><em> image</em>, <em>mass invisibility</em> with <em>mirage arcana</em>, and <em>time stop</em> with <em>mislead</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kitsune as Characters<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Kitsune characters tend toward a chaotic nature, tending toward neither good or evil. Kitsune favor the rogue class and periodically pursue the Arcane Trickster prestige class. Kitsune clerics are rare, but those that do exist typically worship Olidammara or Garl Glittergold, gods of trickery and pranks.</p>
