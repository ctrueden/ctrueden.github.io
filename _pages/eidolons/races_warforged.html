        <p>We have made some alterations (in bold face)&nbsp;to the base warforged description from the Eberron book (p. 23). In particular, in this setting, warforged are created in a variety of shapes to serve a variety of purposes.&nbsp; For non-combative warforged, the Composite Plating feature (see below)&nbsp;may not make sense. If you wish to replace this class feature, please speak with us.</p> <p>Warforged racial characteristics:</p> <p>Living Construct Subtype (Ex): Warforged are constructs with the living construct subtype. A living construct is a created being given sentience and free will through powerful and complex creation enchantments. Warforged are living constructs that combine aspects of both constructs and living creatures, as detailed below.</p> <p>Features: As a living construct, a warforged has the following features.</p> <ul>     <li>A warforged derives its Hit Dice, base attack bonus progression, saving throws, and skill points from the class it selects.</li> </ul> <p>Traits: A warforged possesses the following traits.</p> <ul>     <li>Unlike other constructs, a warforged has a Constitution score.</li>     <li>Unlike other constructs, a warforged does not have low-light vision or darkvision.</li>     <li>Unlike other constructs, a warforged is not immune to mind-affecting spells and abilities.</li>     <li>Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, and effects that caused the sickened condition.<strong>&nbsp;(GM note:&nbsp;no immunity to fatigue, exhaustion or energy drain.)</strong></li>     <li>A warforged cannot heal damage naturally.</li>     <li>Unlike other constructs, warforged are subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage, <strong>fatigue, exhaustion, </strong>stunning, ability damage, ability drain, <strong>energy drain,</strong><em> </em>and death effects or necromancy effects.</li>     <li>As living constructs, warforged can be affected by <strong>most </strong>spells that target living creatures as well as those that target constructs. <strong>However, wound damage dealt to a warforged cannot be healed by cure spells&nbsp;(e.g., <em>cure light wounds</em>)&mdash;instead, repair spells&nbsp;(e.g., <em>repair light damage</em>) must be used. As another example, a warforged is vulnerable to <em>disable construct</em>, but not <em>harm</em>.</strong></li>     <li>The unusual physical construction of warforged makes them vulnerable to certain spells and effects that normally don't affect living creatures. A warforged takes damage from <em>heat metal</em> and <em>chill metal</em> as if he were wearing metal armor. Likewise, a warforged is affected by <em>repel metal or stone</em> as if he were wearing metal armor. A warforged is repelled by <em>repel wood</em>. The iron in the body of a warforged makes him vulnerable to <em>rusting grasp</em>. The creature takes 2d6 points of damage from the spell (Reflex half; save DC 14 + caster's ability modifier). A warforged takes the same damage from a rust monster's touch (Reflex DC 17 half). Spells such as <em>stone to flesh</em>, <em>stone shape</em>, <em>warp wood</em>, and <em>wood shape</em> affect objects only, and thus cannot be used on the stone and wood parts of a warforged.</li>     <li>When a warforged is reduced to <strong>0 wound points or below</strong>, he is inert. He is unconscious and helpless, and he cannot perform any actions. However, an inert warforged does not lose additional wound points unless more damage is dealt to him, as with a living creature that is stable.</li>     <li>As a living construct, a warforged can be raised or resurrected.</li>     <li>A warforged does not need to <strong>eat, drink or breathe, </strong><strong>and cannot benefit from the effects of consumable spells and magic items such as <em>heroes' feast</em> and potions.</strong></li>     <li><strong>Warforged require a period of dormancy of no less than four hours, but they are completely dormant and cannot perceive their surroundings. Each warforged has a 'wake-word' and potentially a physical switch that can be used to force activation, but use of this feature resets the necessary period of dormancy. Penalties are identical to other humanoids if this period of dormancy is not taken.</strong></li>     <li><strong>Each warforged is powered by an internal battery that recharges when he visits a nexus every month. If he fails to visit a nexus within that time and his battery runs out, he is forced into a dormant state until transported to a nexus for recharge. Long-term effects for being left with a drained battery in a dormant state are unknown&mdash;there is disagreement among the technoprophets regarding whether investigations into this question are ethical.</strong></li>     <li><strong>Choose one physical ability score: +2. Choose one mental ability score: -2. These are the only ability score modifications warforged receive. These choices must be in line with your warforged's intended purpose.<br />     </strong></li>     <li><strong>Size: Medium or Small.</strong></li>     <li><strong>Speed: 30 feet for medium warforged, 20 feet for small ones.</strong></li>     <li>Light Fortification (Ex): When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a warforged, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is dealt to vitality normally.</li>     <li>A warforged has a natural weapon in the form of a slam attack that deals 1d4 points of damage.</li>     <li>Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: None.</li>     <li><strong>Favored Class: Depends on warforged construction.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Lastly, every warforged has one feature specific to its construction. Example for combat-focused warforged:</p> <ul>     <li>Composite Plating: The plating used to build this warforged provides a +2 armor bonus. This plating is not natural armor and does not stack with other effects that give an armor bonus (other than natural armor). This composite plating occupies the same space on the body as a suit of armor or a robe, and thus a warforged cannot wear armor or magic robes. Warforged can be enchanted just as armor can be. The character must be present for the entire time it takes to enchant him.<br />     <br />     Composite plating also provides a warforged with a 5% arcane spell failure chance, similar to the penalty for wearing light armor. Any class ability that allows a warforged to ignore the arcane spell failure chance for light armor lets him ignore this penalty as well.</li> </ul> <p>Please talk to the GM&nbsp;about a special feature befitting your warforged's intended purpose.</p>      </div>
