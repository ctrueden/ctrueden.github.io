        <p>Action points will be in use. By default, each character has one action point per session. You use an action point on any d20 roll for your character (after knowing what you rolled, but before knowing whether you succeeded or failed), by rolling 2d6, taking the higher value, and adding to the result. At 14th level, this will become 3d6 take the highest.</p>
<p>You may spend a merit point to have an extra action point per session for your character. (You may spend as many merit points in this fashion as you wish.) If you wish to expend multiple action points on a single action you may (and you may add more dice to the pool at any time), but you always take only the highest die result.</p>      </div>
