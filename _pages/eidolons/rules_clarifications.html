        <p>This page is a placeholder for recent clarifications that have not yet been rolled into the proper pages on the site.</p>
<p>-Swordsage, Crusader and Warblades are common classes.&nbsp; However, as no one has requested to play them who does not have the related book already, we did not send them out.<br />
<br />
-You start with 105 merit points.&nbsp; 70 for being level 0, 5 more for each level 1-7. But note that ability scores must be purchased from the initial 70. Skill savant bonuses cannot exceed character level, so if (e.g.) you play a gestalt character, you must hoard points from the initial 70 until a higher level before purchasing such bonuses.<br />
<br />
-Characters do gain abilities and feats as normal (feats on odd levels, abilities every 4).&nbsp; After you are done spending your initial pool of 70 points, ability scores can no longer be purchased.&nbsp; Feats can never be purchased.<br />
<br />
-Rune mages will progress with wizard BAB and good Will save, and gain 6 Vitality each level.&nbsp; Rune mages and Bards will also regain one point of Spellpool each round, even if their vitality is not full.&nbsp; If their Vitality is full, this means they regain two points of Spellpool per round. <br />
<br />
-Geomancers will progress with wizard BAB and good Will, and gain 6 Vitality each level. They also gain Bloodline benefits, per the Sorcerer class, except for bonus spells. They are considered for the purposes of Bloodline to gain the benefits as though they had a caster level equal to their Geomancer level. Note that Geomancers are not eligible for Arcane or Divine prestige classes, as they are not arcane or divine spellcasters.<br />
<br />
-Bard, paladin and ranger spells are available for purchase with merit points at normal cost (i.e., minimum class level plus spell level).<br />
<br />
-Cantrips cost one merit point to obtain, and may be used at will with no limit on number of times per day.&nbsp; Spellcasters may cast cantrips with no expenditure of vitality, but may choose to increase their effective caster level by expending extra vitality from their Spellpool as normal. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
-Spells that grant temporary hit points grant temporary Vitality that cannot be used for spellcasting&mdash;only to avoid being beaten down.<br />
<br />
-Bards will be the first to reach 6th level spells.&nbsp; Runemages, druids and geomancers can also achieve 6th-level or higher spells by reaching epic levels.&nbsp; It is expected that no one will achieve higher than 21st level, but obtaining 6th-level spells as a runemage is certainly possible.<br />
<br />
-Aging bonuses do not exist.&nbsp; Aging penalties are applied only when a character has suffered greatly from the Withering.</p>
<p>First of all: to protect our time as GMs when evaluating non-core (i.e., non-Pathfinder) material, we are placing a limit of up to three feats and three spells from non-core material, including the Spell Compendium, Complete books, and other such sources. Please pare down your lists of non-core material to three things before asking about them. If we nix anything, you may then ask about something else.</p>
<p>VITALITY-BASED POWERS</p>
<p>Divine healing abilities:<br />
- &quot;Revitalize&quot; for geomancers (unless they are too far away from a ley line),&nbsp; clerics, druids and paladins is a 1-for-1 vitality transfer, as much or as little as desired as a standard action.. Note that you can only restore normal vitality in this fashion, not spellpools.<br />
- When you revitalize someone, you can sense how many vitality points they are down (but now how many they have left).<br />
- As an option, you may choose to restore more vitality than they are down, with the excess as temporarily vitality points (i.e., not usable for special abilities).<br />
- Paladins also have their original &quot;lay on hands&quot; class feature (in addition to the &quot;revitalize&quot; ability). Lay on hands is usable with wounds only. A paladin cannot both &quot;lay on hands&quot; and &quot;revitalize&quot; as part of the same standard action. When using lay on hands, he senses how many wound points the target is missing. He cannot restore more wound points then they are missing.<br />
- The cleric and paladin Channel Positive Energy class feature heals wounds, not vitality.<br />
<br />
- Practiced Spellcaster does not exist<br />
- Extra Spell is fine</p>
<p>MAGIC ITEMS</p>
<p>Which items are allowed:<br />
- When purchasing magic items with your 23,200 gp, only items from the PF book are allowed.<br />
- Pearls of power do not exist in this setting.<br />
- If you wish to have a unique magical item not found in the PF book, give us an idea of the equipment and its history and we will assign a merit point cost.</p>
<p>More rulings:<br />
&nbsp;* Mythril and adamantine special materials are allowed.<br />
&nbsp;* Favored classes do not grant extra HP or skills.<br />
&nbsp;* If you die by withering, you rise as undead. If you are very withered, but die in some other fashion, you are generally safe.</p>      </div>
