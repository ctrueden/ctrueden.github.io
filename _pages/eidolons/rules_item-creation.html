        <p>Item creation takes one year. It costs the usual gold but no experience, and you must also have the appropriate feat.</p>
<p>The item must be at a nexus. You may engage in other activities during the year, but you must visit the nexus every day in order to cast the appropriate spells. It is possible for a nexus to support crafting many magical items simultaneously, but only attuned to one enchantment type at a time&mdash;for example, a &quot;+1 shocking burst weapon&quot; (but could be swords and daggers and javelins and halberds and bows...).</p>
<p>Your caster level for creating magic items is the normal half progression. I.e., a non-epic caster cannot craft magic items requiring spells above 5th level.</p>
<p>In general, the only magic items are permanent ones (i.e., no potions, scrolls, or wands).</p>
<p>This item creation process greatly informs the politics of the world. The technoprophets are more expansionist than they might be otherwise because they want more nexuses to be able to produce more kinds of magic items simultaneously.</p>
<p>The Empire has a different process for creating items, fueled by the power of their gods. It still takes one year, but magic items of different types can be simultaneously produced at the same temples. This has allowed them to create more of a &quot;magic item factory&quot; than is possible outside the Empire. Essentially, it is one of several advantages they possess as they pursue their expansionist goals.<br />
