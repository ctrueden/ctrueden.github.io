        <p>We are introducing a new type of action called the minor action. A minor action takes your swift action, but can be performed subsequent times with move actions (normally performing a second swift action takes your standard action). So it is possible to perform up to three minor actions in a round by spending your swift, move and standard actions doing so.</p>
<p>Certain actions that Pathfinder classifies as move-equivalent actions we are reclassifying as minor actions.&nbsp;Specifically:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Draw one or two weapons (but cannot be combined with a move as described in the Pathfinder book)</li>
    <li>Load a hand crossbow or light crossbow</li>
    <li>Pick up an item</li>
    <li>Retrieve a stored item (assuming it is accessible)</li>
</ul>
<p>We may deem other actions to be minor actions as we see fit during a session.</p>
<p>Lastly, unlike a swift action, a minor action can be taken during the course of a full attack action. Thus, for example, it is possible to take a full attack with a light crossbow:&nbsp;firing once, reloading, and firing a second time. Similar techniques become possible with thrown weapons such as daggers.</p>      </div>
