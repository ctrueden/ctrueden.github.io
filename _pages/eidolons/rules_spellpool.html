        <p>High ability scores do not grant 'bonus spells', as the system for spellcasting involves a vitality cost. However, exceptional attributes will grant the character a spellpool of extra vitality that can be used solely for spellcasting.</p>
<p>This spellpool will contain a number of vitality points equal to your casting stat -10 (e.g., 7 in the case of a 17). For each spell cast, you may choose whether to use your Spellpool or your normal vitality pool. Any time you expend your Spellpool instead of your vitality, you gain a +1 to the effective caster level of the effect per Spellpool vitality spent. You may choose how many points to expend from the Spellpool to empower spells. Vitality regained normally will refill your Vitality pool first, and once your Vitality is full, it will refill the Spellpool. It is possible to 'overcharge' a spell by expending more Spellpool vitality than the spell's Vitality cost. In this case the extra vitality is used normally to increase caster level. We are working on feats that will further augment the spellpool.</p>
<p>The following classes get a spellpool: bard, cleric, druid, geomancer, rune mage. All other caster classes do not get a spellpool.</p>
<p>The following classes refill one point of spellpool per round: bard, rune mage (the others only refill spellpool once vitality is full)</p>
<p>For multiclass spellcasters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Only one spellpool per character.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>For each caster class, compute its normal spellpool value (key ability score minus 10). Take that value, or the class level, whichever is lower. Choose one caster class to use its full normal spellpool value, without the class level bound.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Sum these values together to compute your total spellpool.</p>
    </li>
    <li>For example, a bard 5/cleric 3/geomancer 7 with Wis 18 and Cha 20 would have a maximum of 20-10=10 spellpool points from geomancer, 20-10=10 spellpool points from bard, and 18-10=8 from cleric. Either bard or cleric would net an additional 5 points from being chosen for exemption from the class level bound (whereas geomancer would net only 3 extra points). Thus, assuming you choose cleric for exemption, your total spellpool is 5 (bard) + 8 (cleric) + 7 (geomancer) = 20 spellpool points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using your spellpool, it is possible to have an effective caster level above your character level for a particular spell, if you spend enough points.</p>      </div>
