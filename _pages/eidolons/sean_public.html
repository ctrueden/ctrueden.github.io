<p>For most of his life, Naxk&nbsp;(pronounced &quot;Nak&quot;) was part of the Blackspear tribe of the Hordes. More specifically, he belonged to a group of twenty or so hobgoblins, orcs, goblins, and kobolds known only as Grugar's Speshul Boyz. Their patron, Grugar, was an orc who fancied himself a king, and constantly sent his boyz out to undermine the authoritarian Idealogues and sometimes even other tribes who encroached on his territory. Naxk was the team's locksmith and trapmaker, and as a goblin was treated poorly by the hobgoblin and orc members of the group. They would force him and the kobolds of the group to do what they called &quot;bitch detail&quot;, and was often ridiculed for being sneaky and slight of build instead of strong and sturdy, being compared to &quot;dem lite-steppin pinkie elves&quot;, an explitive usually followed by hobgoblin spittle.</p> <p>Resentment built up slowly within Naxk over time, so when the opportunity presented itself to make a pact with the infernal powers at the mere compromising of his soul, the young goblin was more than happy to accept. With these newfound powers, Naxk found himself getting picked on far less by his comrades. Though he never truly earned much respect, he knew he had earned some grudging form of acknowledgement. It wasn't long before the goblin announced that he would be leaving the boyz behind, and with no objections. Though nobody in the tribe would admit it, Naxk knew that he had begun to scare them.</p> <p><strong>Outward appearance</strong></p> <p>I didn't draw this picture, and I don't know who did, but I think it depicts a smug looking goblin pretty well. It's just to give a general idea of what he looks like:</p> <p><img alt="" src="http://www.naturalone.net/images/goblin.jpg" /><br /> <br /> <strong>Personality<br /> </strong></p> <p>General - Arrogant, Enthusiastic, Easy-Going<br /> Decision Making - Oblivious, Anti-Authority, Daring<br /> Danger - Paranoid, Volatile</p> <p><strong>Description</strong></p> <p>Standing here is a light-green skinned goblin wearing tattered and oddly colored clothing, patchwork leather armor and a smug grin. Underneath the leathers you can see the pieces of mismatched cloth, some died in reds and earthy browns; Others are died black and torn, but it is hard to tell from this distance whether or not it is from dye or burn-marks. Around his waist is what appears to be a crude belt with even more crudely made pouches hanging from it. Around his neck is some sort of necklace adorned with a few small rat skulls. How cute. He must think it's somehow fashionable. The only remotely decent article of clothing on him is the dark cloak draped about him which could have easily been stolen, considering that it doesn't have the same weathered look that the rest of his gear does. After all, why else would a hobo have such a smirk on his face?</p>      </div>
