      <p><em>If what you seek is always in the last place you look, then you have chosen too soon to give up the search.</em> -Grandmaster Egorin</p><p>Whenever I find myself frustrated by a task, I try to reflect on these words, gifted to me by my master. I must remember that truth is to be discovered in the entirety of one's journey, rather than merely its conclusion. Despite this, I have traveled many months, and feel no closer to any answers. Still, I have found a stalwart companion in Arwel, and a series of mysteries in young Haroun. If I posess the wisdom to remain attentive, I expect there will be much here for me to learn.</p><p>Arwel and I will be taking Haroun with us on our latest mercenary contract, the escort of a Delphian lineship. I admit a certain excitment in seeing one personally, though the vagueries of our contract concern me. Furthermore, Haroun recieved a powerful vision, of our protected cargo somehow finding a place in Arwel's posession, and of myself twisted, corrupted into the vile Rahshasa. I pray that so troubling a vision speaks merely of some metaphor, though the imagery leaves me on edge.</p><p>Within the settlement, as the lineship approached, the chaos of this world shook my resolve as a sizable quake struck, replacing one of the caravan guards with none other than General Isaline, though I fear even she may not be enough to fight the massed hordes that now approach us.</p>

      <p>Happenstance stole it right out from under our nose. Hopeful those noble brats have some tricks up their sleeves, because that tribal legion will be the least of their problems. It is safer with the Technomancer's than more knowledgeable hands. Evantane was right about the Technomancer's. They always over analyze things.</p> <p>I probably wouldn't have survived the fight anyway. I am weak from a lack of sustenance, and travel and fighting where never my shtick. At least, the circumstances that denied me have provided me a place lush and green and ripe and unwatched.</p> <p>Though, my new found company is a far bit stranger then what i just left, and among them there is a human even. Even more interesting is that they are chasing a necromancer who looks to be of the corrupted. Vance? Hah, looks like fate knows well enough where I should be.</p> <p>Hopeful, the sword is safe until I get back to it.</p>
