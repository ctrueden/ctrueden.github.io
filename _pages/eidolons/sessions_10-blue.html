      <p>So much for that idea. I can be manipulated by the whims of fate. So much for anything that old hag told me having any meaning beyond the obvious. <br /><br />All of a sudden I find my self with “the other group” in the Empire. They are holed up with some guy named Dragontamer, spending a week preparing to assault the Marquis Von Wagram. Kith was with them, though we didn’t take much time to talk.<br /><br />Since we were in the empire, I figured it was a good time to not be me. I donned my dragonborn alter-ego for the duration of my visit. I hope my crimes now pale in comparison to the current events, but the empire isn’t know for it’s sense of perspective.<br /><br />Lyra Dragontamer goes missing early in the week. Haroun attempts to use prophesy to gain insight in the marquis and his fortress. In the end, we opted for the always classic play of sneaking in the side door and rushing him. Interestingly enough, we weren’t the only ones with this grand plan. Three members of another group joined us in the Marquis’s throne room. This group consisted of Za’har, who I had seen in the old hag’s fortress. Naxk, whom I haven’t seen since I left the underworld was also with them. Vashir rounded out the group. He was a warrior that helped keep the monsters away from the underworld cities. <br /><br />To make a short story shorter, we beat him up a bit, he turned into mist and fled underground. We followed, fought a literal wall of undead, and found his coffin hiding in an inverted nexus. We let Isaline have the honors. <br /><br />Za’har and Naxk planned to replace the Marquis with Vashir. I can’t say that I really care. All I’ve learned is that the empire is a much more confused and chaotic place that I had imagined.<br /><br />I do wonder how Za’har, Naxk, and Vashir got involved. I could only guess that the magistrate, or his organization, is behind their involvement. What could they have in store for me, now that I brought the magistrate to the tower?</p>
