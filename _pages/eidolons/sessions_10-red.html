      <p>Entry 27: I doubt many people could say they have had the kind of day that I&nbsp;have today.&nbsp; I have met over half of the known pantheon of gods in one afternoon, at the end of the world.&nbsp; I almost think I&nbsp;must have gone mad.&nbsp; I very well could have, I certainly have not been quaked before.&nbsp; Not only that but I came face to face with the very Necromancer who almost killed me.&nbsp; Then I stood by while half of Sahrit was stolen from him by that Necromancer.&nbsp; Anne materialized in his face and told me something about the Lady.&nbsp; The lady seems to be the Raven Queen, and I will admit I've never felt praying to a diety to be productive, but if Anne is connected then she warrents attention.</p><p>I don't feel great about what happened to Sahrit, though I thought he was not being smart about his choices he did not deserve what happened.&nbsp; It seemed Sahrit is Vance's son, but he had become a liability.&nbsp; We were trapped, and Sahrit refused to promise to not invert Nexus's which did not seem horrible.&nbsp; Sahrit refused to agree, and thus all but Arwell would stand with him.&nbsp; Arwell was paralyzed, and Sahrit was destroyed.&nbsp; Well until he wasn't.&nbsp; I must admit that was confusing.</p><p>I'm warry of this Raven Queen, for the few stories I've read warn she is as dangerous as she is benevolent.&nbsp; Even the gods that I&nbsp;met later warned me of her.&nbsp; I&nbsp;must learn more about her.</p><p>The Gods want to end the Nexus's, to what end I don't know.&nbsp; I&nbsp;doubt it is as simple as they stated however.&nbsp; Or why they would simply tell us to keep open minds.</p><p>My infection still nags at me, I&nbsp;must get control of it before more time passes.&nbsp; Or I'm afraid of what I&nbsp;might become if I&nbsp;don't.&nbsp; More to come later.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My companions just stood there and let it happen. Joseph, Ed, Biger, and Cameron, they all showed me that before power all morality collapses. But Arwel, you stood poised to stop it. I am sorry that you failed.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The others that work for Vance, they called him an honorable man, called my brother a idiot, and threatened to kill us. They had no empathy, they argued with no reason, they would not give up a simple secret to stop that madness. The things to come are on their hands.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They worked to stop my brother from doing something he might have never done. All on the word of that &quot;honarable man&quot;, Vance. A man who has, and continues to, betray his family. A man who killed and corrupted to enact a &quot;necessary&quot; evil. His words are poison that they have drank to much from.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance got what he wanted. Twisting the acts of good people as he always does. There are no innocent people anymore, when such a man can make his way of the righteous and the vile alike.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I pity my brother, cast a villian, he is the greatest victim of us all. There is no rest for him, no peace. Vengance and hate is all he will know. I don't blame him. I am even starting to agree. I sought redemption for my mistakes, but it all seems so purposeless now.</p>

      <p>12/12/2009<br />Session 10<br /><br />Ahhh, there's a third group (the dark eidolons). Gaaahhhh/<br /><br /><br />Biger is absent. (Me and Alex's character were quaked out)<br /><br />Vance has offered to take the eidolon/soul from within Sahret.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Sahret has 2 mothers.&nbsp; one of which wishes the destruction of the soul which Sahret possess.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance is a god?&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance wishes to study the thing in Sahret, though he could destroy it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance pulls out his eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; He clearly has installed a ruby eye in his ruined eye socket.&nbsp; &quot;This is the vessel.&quot; (Now guess which god he is).<br /><br />Vance is willing to demonstrate what he's going to do by bringing us in and showing us, but he will conduct the research in person.<br /><br />Sahret Goes to Obad-hai and says &quot;no.&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Demonstrate your honesty.... swear to Vecna.&nbsp; There will be no secrets from him.&nbsp; It will not bind you more thoroughly, it will just be more reasonable.&nbsp; I merely ask that you stop inverting nexuses and try to do your best to stop your eidolon or others from doing the same.'&nbsp; <br />(Gods have avatars who walk the world occasionally.)&nbsp;&nbsp; It requires poermission of other gods.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sahret swears to Vecna (And Vance is biound up in this), 'I swear to Vecna to not invert any more nexuses and to take my best efforts to keep my eidolon or others from doing so.'.<br /><br />ASpparently he (The eidolon) won't be willign to escape.<br /><br />Should he be restrained (Asks Ed)... nmo, apparently.<br /><br /><br />There is a quake now.&nbsp; This is one of those uber-quakes.&nbsp; This quake feels... 'different' somehow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Alex's cahracter gets whisked here.&nbsp; The quake happened during the teleport.<br /><br />For me... as we were all running up the stairs, wrin and I were running,. There was a quake and I'm suddenly here.&nbsp; Everyone's here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some time has passed, clearly...&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe this is a different reality with a bit of skewed time.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel rides up to me and... hmmm.&nbsp; There are 3 people I don't recognize (Alex's cahracter, Lucas' character and Danielle's character).<br /><br />&nbsp; Alex's chaeracter:&nbsp; a male gray elf.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the same race as Elise.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'THose elves from Arx'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks buff.&nbsp; Is wearing black robes.&nbsp; Wears a holy symbol of nerull. (WHo is not on the wall, but is an old god!)&nbsp; he is -a- god of death.&nbsp; Nerull is believed to be associated witht he withering in someway... maybe he can channel it or causes it... qwithering is one of his portfolio items.&nbsp; I'ts unclear where he came in...&nbsp; Wee Jass was an older god, Nerull is younger, but Wee Jass is simply ancient.<br /><br /><br />Sahret is wearing mithral now instead of leather.&nbsp; He's not wearing the ring he was wearingh before.<br /><br />Tallish fold dragonborn runemage.&nbsp; Very serious, very gruff. (Lucas' character).&nbsp; He gives Jason's character a wiggy feeling.<br /><br />Danielle's character.&nbsp; A 3' halfling, adrogynous, short black hair green eyes travelling clothes, a crossbow, clearly nomadic.<br /><br />Vance's description.&nbsp; Last time I saw him at Eloiyes leading a bunch of necromancer.&nbsp; Now he has a ruby eye.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone seems disoriented.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are withered fiends int he room.&nbsp; That's abnormal...&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiends don't normally wither, but then, Vance is here.&nbsp; They're jsut kinda standing or hovering there.&nbsp; Devils 4 are barbed 1 ice, 2 a horned.&nbsp; These are the same ones whos body we saw.&nbsp; I sense some intelligence from some of thenm.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance waits until people quiet <br /><br />THen he says... &quot;Good of you to join us... To fill you in as you are no doubt confused... we are here to stop Sahret here, my son, to stop from destroying the world...&quot;&nbsp; (People seem to be aghreeing... Sahret is going to stepo back and try to make a teleport quake.)&nbsp; Ed charges and smacks Sahret good and good.&nbsp; (This is nate's 3rd bad thing.)<br /><br />Lots happens.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance clenches his fist and Sahret fails to do what e he was tryign to do.&nbsp; Ed grabs him and holds him.<br /><br />Vance:&nbsp; &quot;:You -dare- to yuse my power against me? ' &quot;<br />'It's the best chance I had.'<br />&quot;You have -NO- chance.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Sahret is easily pinned by Ed from the pain. Ed suggests that Sahret not try it again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance says &quot;I offer you a choice.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Alex's character is deeply evil).&nbsp; Sahret has the evil emanating from his shoulder.&nbsp; Vance also evil.&nbsp;&nbsp; The latter two of nosebleed level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance is relentlessly evil.&nbsp; (sahret himself is not as evil [he's selfishly evil bordering on supernatural evil as Alex is.)<br /><br />Vance swore not to destroy the world and not reverse nexuses and they had the other Sahret swear it as well.<br /><br />Sahret relents...&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The only escape route is clearly into... well, a realm I've been before.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Sahret, your father and the other you have already made this oath.&quot; (Says danielles character)<br /><br />Sahret refreshes at Inverted Nexuses.&nbsp; <br /><br />I would be satisfied if you swore to not invert nexuses or inform others how to do so, but I don't expect you to stop everyone who does.&nbsp; <br /><br />The 6 inverted nexuses are all thanks to Nate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the next week all of the nexuses within the empire will be untethered/collapsed/destroyed.&nbsp; A rogue agent within the empire acts against the interest of his superiors.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;THere have been talk among geomancers about inverting and reverting nexuses, but stealing them is not the answer.&nbsp; there are peopel like myself who will make sure that people who need to use them can do so.&nbsp; &quot;Danielles character... it's not the full truth.<br /><br />Danielle's character asks the other Sahret if he was watching the home Sahret.&nbsp; Danielle says she has no will to harm Sahret.&nbsp; Sahret&nbsp; disagrees, thinking she brought Vance.&nbsp; <br />Danielle's cahracter says that she can invert Nexuses<br /><br />Alex's character suggests that he <br /><br /><br />Arwel suggests...<br /><br />Danielle swears that she will swear to help people who require inverted nexuses to survive to do so as long as it doesn't hurt others lots.&nbsp; This oath was very smooth...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The technoprophets figured out how to invert nexuses.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel provides a shield between vance and Sahret as Vacne says &quot;Ysour braying annoys me&quot; and reaches out to touch him.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Sahret suddenly stiffens.&nbsp; Danielle's character says that this soul shouldn't be in one persons hand...&nbsp; Alex's cjaracter starts withering Sahret.&nbsp; Alex's character doesn't understand the question when Jpoe asks if Alex's character ate the age of him or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance:&nbsp; If you allow me to do what I wish to do, the pothner will be unharmed.<br /><br />Danielle's character suggested that Vance.&nbsp; One of his mother hates Sahret.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance says that he wasn't willing to have a whole council in his place.&nbsp; <br /><br />vance looks at Arwel:&nbsp;&nbsp; WIll you let this proceed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Barnabas starts pawing at Arwel.&nbsp; Hoping Arwel doesn't stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason's character says that bthe bear thinks that it would be best for its master if this thing went through. Jason's character is tyelling the truth but he's more certain than he ought to be jjust by watching hte bear paw at him (Holy shit I sense motived Jason's character).&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed suggests that Sahret remember back to the priestess of the black.&nbsp; <br /><br />(5 invereted in the swam,p and 2 Nexuses)<br /><br />Vance says&quot;&nbsp; Alright, you've listened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will release you and you will say one word:&nbsp; Yay or Nay.&nbsp; Make your decision...<br /><br />Vance releases the paralysis.&nbsp; Sahret says&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Fuck......&quot; And is paralyzed again.&nbsp; (His dominant emotion ius one of spite).<br /><br />Arwel interposes herself between Vance and Sahret now.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Vance tries to paralyze Arwel as she's distracted.&nbsp; A coldness spreads throughout her body and she resists the paralyzation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sahret will destroy the world according to Vecna.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance moves back a bit and an invisible force drags Sahret.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Ruby eye of Vance is removed by him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vecna reaches out and sends out some energy at Sahret...&nbsp;&nbsp; (The energy from inverting a nexus).&nbsp; He plunges a hand down into Sahrets Should, Vance graspos and steels himself and rips out a spiritual essence and pushes it into the gem and he puts it back in his eye<br /><br />Sahret is still lying there, its subtly changed back into good Sahret.&nbsp; We feel a very localized quake... its a bnit strange but it doesn't feel like an uberquake (Like when the sword was touched).&nbsp; This time it felt like he activated something vaguely geomantic and something else began imemdiately after it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quake wasn't triggered by Sahrets soul...&nbsp;&nbsp; Something else used it as a sparkplug. <br /><br />Vance's eye glows darkly-ier than it had been.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance says he'll allow Danielle's cahracter to come and ensure that she will be involved.&nbsp; There will probably be limits to everything.<br /><br />&quot;I would rather you not say where my abode is but we dwell in the frozen wood beyond the lake.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Joe expresses interest in them,<br /><br />&quot;Knowledge should be sought without compromise&quot;.&nbsp; tells joe that if he wishes to learn more he could come to Vance's domain.&nbsp; <br /><br />He asks why Vance's dwarven companiona ttacked joe in Eloes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;He is envious of your ability as you have no doubt surmised.&nbsp; You are quite unique and I am curious to you as well.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Joe reaches out to shake Vance's hand in agreement... and there is suddenly a ghostly presence between Joe and Vance.&nbsp; And there is a small elf girl in ghostly form betwen them (It's Ann).&nbsp; THere is a look of extreme hostility on her face, and we hear her growl in her little girl voice... &quot;No Joe!&quot;<br /><br />And Vance steps back.&nbsp; And Joe stops his advance...&nbsp;&nbsp; I sense motive Vance:&nbsp; Vance is surprised and perhaps a little afraid because he didn't understand what happened.,.&nbsp;&nbsp; A big WTF emote over his head.&nbsp; <br /><br />There's an undertone of exceitement from Joe because Ann acted.&nbsp; Ann is looking hostile towards Vance.<br /><br /><br />Ann Says &quot;He's bad, you stay away.&quot;<br /><br />Joe:&nbsp; &quot;Okay, Ann, I'm sory I upset yuou.&nbsp; i simply was looking for more ways to help you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;not Him&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />Joe: &quot;Alright then, Ann.&quot;<br /><br />Vance is upset, cusses a bit...&nbsp; says hshe doesn't know what she's ctalking about...&nbsp; &quot;Fucking little bitch...&nbsp;&nbsp; Raven Queen.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Raven queen is patron of winter who judges you when you die.&nbsp; Major but doesn't have an alcove.&nbsp; (He muttered under his death.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance:&nbsp; &quot;Another opoportunity destroyed by an upstart god&quot; exasperated.<br /><br />She is a usurper just like Vecna, says Vance.&nbsp; There was some relation to vecna fromt he oaths sworn though.&nbsp; <br /><br />Are you saying this girl is connected to the raven queen?<br /><br />Ann now has a glyph on her right cheek in the shape of a raIt justkind of appeared after teaching her rune magic.&nbsp; <br /><br />Her Withered soul does not belong to Nerull....&nbsp;&nbsp; Her soul is owned by another apart from Nerull and her soul is partico[pating in the personality of the creature.&nbsp; The withered fiends were soulless...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance's soul is still in his body.<br /><br />Ann scolds Joe:&nbsp; &quot;Be more Careful... The Lady doesn't like him and you shouldn't either.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Ann Says that the Raven queen would like top be talked to to him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance says to Joe:&nbsp; &quot;The Next time we meet, I will need to destroy you.&nbsp; I would urge you strongly to stay away fromt eh raven queen.&nbsp; She is heartless and she will consume you.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vance believes what he says.)&nbsp;&nbsp; She's merciless but not vindictive according to legend.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Lucas's character asks Vance:&nbsp; &quot;What of us now?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Vance Says to Danielle I will send for you later as agreed... withina&nbsp; few days at most.)&nbsp; Lucas's charactrers secrets are shielded from me, this is most unusual (Said Vance).&nbsp; Vance says that he regrets that he cannot help you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucas's character said he was looking for a she from her past.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Vance said that Ed knew the way to Vance's Keep.&nbsp; <br /><br />Danielle's character is now responsible for what happens to Sahret and she muyst make a good faith effort to keep Vance from torturing or the like to the soul.&nbsp; Vance quickened teleport... Vance took the Devils that were withered.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Down the stone hatch.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sahret wakes feleing like good sore, Barnabas is really happy...

They go down (Says Jason's character)&nbsp; Alex's character knows The giod who is unknown (lloth).&nbsp; <br /><br />We return to the Nexus map.&nbsp; Ed reverses...&nbsp; It shows only what could have been... Ed goes to first possible entry:&nbsp; It is the oNLy possible beginning (Devoid of the flow present in the rest.).&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing, and then the Nexuses pop into being.&nbsp; The war of the wasts is looked at by Ed.&nbsp; Where the wastes are now wasm always less nexused.&nbsp; No new nexuses appear.&nbsp; The number of Nexuses is the same except for that tiny moving one...&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a spot in the wastes that Haruhn was Born in.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now Ed tries to look to the future:&nbsp; No success.&nbsp; <br /><br />Someone takes notice when Jason's character concentrates with the rune...&nbsp; Eyes of this place and which are powerful... he feels uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they're here and We sense a great divine power/.&nbsp; Ahhhhh!<br /><br />Upstairs Alex's cahracter says &quot; You might want to come up here.&quot;&nbsp; When we arrive.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Don't profane in front of the God's&quot;&nbsp; in response to Ed's cussing at being removed formt he glyph again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis appears... as a warforged... he represents technological progress... typically female...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna appears, Asmodeus as well (Lord of the 9 hells).&nbsp; Sehanine, Corellon, Kord, Erythnul, Gruumsh, Moradin is here.&nbsp; They all formed a line<br /><br />Asmodeus speaks first:&nbsp; &quot;We have come here united in purpose to speak to all of you, the mortals who have foudn thsi place.&nbsp; We come to convince you of your sacred duty heretofore.&nbsp; This place was built millenia ago to ensure the stability of the world as you have no doubt guessed.&nbsp; I did not participate in its destruction, but many of my colleagues here did.&quot;<br /><br />Erathis:&nbsp; &quot;The proper use of this temple may be the key to perfecting civilization but its misuse would wipe out civilization itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we have hidden it away here and kept it secret.&nbsp; fYou have all uncovered this secret.&quot;<br /><br />Sehanine: &quot;A Time of war is at hand, it is probably too late to avert it but we can minimize the damage.&nbsp; if the location of thsi place were known, it would be jsiut one more excuse to fight...&nbsp;&nbsp; we wish for all of you to ensure that when the fight comes ehre that it won't be the downfall of everything.&nbsp; &quot;<br /><br />Asmodeus: &quot;Even with this places sanctity ensured, there are still amny dangers relating to the net of nexyus energy.&nbsp; as you are well aware there ar epeople inverting energies and causing other destructiosn.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is inevitable but we would see it not hastened.&nbsp;&nbsp; There will be a war, but you should all remember this moment when you were not fighting amongst one another.&quot;<br /><br />Mopradin: &quot;All of ya should remember your compassion and your mercy.&nbsp; My people, despite our holy quest and our pledge to rid the world of the nexuses have still showed compassion to those of the lord of lies here, and for once he speaks the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp; We allow them to invert nexuses for now, knowing it'll make things better for when they're all gone.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Asmodeus: We wish to eliminate this worlds reliance on nexus energy butin a way that keeps balance... (whispers... unfortunately).&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna:&nbsp; If we eliminate the nexuses, everyone can exist on the same energuies....&nbsp; It would be a new way but would prevent the world from unraveling on its center.<br /><br />gruumhsh:&nbsp; &quot;Ultimately, this place must be destroyed...&nbsp;&nbsp; We all came together to build this place, and we now all come safely together to see it safely dispelled.&nbsp; &quot;<br /><br />corellon says:&nbsp; &quot;This place is not yet ready to be unravelled.&nbsp;&nbsp; So maintain secrecy...&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember eachothers plights, and ishould you face eachopther in the coming war, speak to eachother as brohters before you engage in bnloodshed.&nbsp; <br /><br />The doors burst open and someone tumbles in... a lithe looking figure tumbles in with a sad mask and another with a happy mask comes out of another mural.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Gods stop and a sense motive...&nbsp;&nbsp; The masked things have an alieness to them... and the gods weren't expoecting this...&nbsp;&nbsp; They're like... hmmmm....&nbsp; olidamarra's here...&nbsp; The gods are a bnit concerned because of this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Happy says:&nbsp; An excewllent plan!<br /><br />Sadness:&nbsp;&nbsp; A Terrible plan!<br /><br /><br />Lucas's cahracter is sure he wouldn't travel with these.<br /><br />Happy:&nbsp; Shut up you imposter!<br /><br />Sad:&nbsp; You claim to be olidamarra!&nbsp; I take that name for myuself.<br /><br /><br />They keep bickering.&nbsp; Happy tumbles through us.&nbsp; He looks right at jason's character and says&quot;&nbsp; You're one of those!<br /><br />Sad says&nbsp; He IS one of those!<br /><br />They say in unison &quot;This merits further thought&quot; and they start arguing in earnest.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kord says &quot;Knock it off.&quot;<br /><br />Olidammar is arguing with himself over whether the place should be destroyed.<br /><br />Then they look suddenly at Kuno (Lucas's characters).&nbsp; &quot;What do you think&quot;.. <br /><br />&quot;I think it should be here as long as its useful.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Wrin says : &quot;Beware.&nbsp; Masterful trickery.&nbsp; Confusing.&nbsp; Dangerous.&nbsp; Speak more later.&quot;&nbsp; I notice a little light blinkliung on Wrins head.&nbsp; Its blinking Yellow...
