      <p><em>It is the sole province of the light to cast shadow.</em> -Grandmaster Egorin</p><p>The battle for the lineship goes poorly. Powerful shamans of the hordes have beset our forces with a vicious sandstorm, and the orges of the flayed skull tribe manage to withstand the assault of Delphian cannons. The other guards fought firmly to protect the lineship itself, a particularly nimble fencer by name of Rebin held off boarding orcs as they were belayed by the shrill magic song of the dark elf, Gwenvyth. Though we managed a few counterattacks, it quickly became clear that our soldiers, and the settlement, were lost, and we retreated to within the lineship.</p><p>It was within the cargo hold of the lineship that we fought a small and powerful group intent on stealing the sword, and among them is a practitioner of the Heaven Fist. He fights with clawed gauntles, and dark energies. This is not the Fist of Heaven that know, but something more sinister. That being said, it is not the Hell Fist, but some shadowed reflection of the heaven technique. I know not how, or who, but there are more pressing oncerns. The walls are beginning to buckle....</p>

      <p>Great....just damned&nbsp;great.&nbsp; An irregularity seems to have flung me from the Feywood to the gods' damned wastes.&nbsp; I'm still a bit confused as to how this all happened and&nbsp;unfortunately there is little chance to gather my thoughts before returning to combat.&nbsp; Strange magic and forces seem to be at work this last week and there is naught I can do about it.&nbsp; The Vanquisher and a mix of tribal forces overwhelmed the few defenders of the Delphian transport.&nbsp; The target of their search seems to be the same sword I saw about a week ago, or at least another of the same type.&nbsp; Some new companions have emerged and have done an excellent job battling the odds for as long as we could.&nbsp; Still the transport has fallen and a final stand in the hold was under control until outside forces managed to crack the hull and gave the ghost a path to escape.&nbsp; Quick butcher's work might give us a chance to stop the ghost and retain the sword, but I do not relish the thought of holding out against every foe in this hold if need be.&nbsp; We need a lucky break...</p>
