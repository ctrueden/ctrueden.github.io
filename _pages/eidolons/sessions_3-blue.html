      <p>Story time!  Everyone that I'm traveling with is special in some way.  They are all quite powerful and have lived such interesting lives.  Almost everyone is missing a piece or two, and Sahrit even seems to have two pasts.  I wonder if he has two presents as well.<br /><br /> <br /><br />I was a little nervous about exposing their histories, lest some secret get loose that they would prefer to keep.  I'm sure I got close to that line, but I don't think I crossed it.  A few people were unaware of the specifics of some items of their past, such as Biger's crank getting attached, or Eidylol's long history.<br /><br />Joseph seemed relieved to have his secret exposed.  Or maybe it was that we didn't persecute him for his gift, and that we heard him out.  He introduced us to Ann, the remains of the little girl he withered to death.  She seems like a sweet and playful little girl, though Joseph claimed I was the first person she had warmed up to.  Warms the heart.  I hope he can do right by her.  And I hope I can chat with her some more at some point soon.<br /><br />Thankfully Joseph's confession took ran until another major quake happened and we didn't get to Kith.  Kith has an ugly past, and some ugly secrets that I'm sure he'd prefer to remain secret.  I prefer they remain secret as well.<br /><br />I told him that I knew that he killed the emperor.  He thought that was a bold accusation.  I think he misunderstood me, I wasn't looking for confirmation.  I explained that I saw it in his past, and that the scroll that I showed him was for the one who assassinated the emperor.   I explained that I had no problems with his actions, and I wanted to help him keep his secret.  He replied that he was glad that he didn't have to kill me, and acknowledged that either could kill the other if we so chose.<br /><br />So, as I said, as Joseph finished, another large quake happened.  Biger and Sahrit vanished and were replaced with Haroun and Arwel.  Arwel is a Dragonborn that I've met previously, as she runs a small hostel.  She's quite the accomplished fighter, though she likes to go on about her training a bit much.<br /><br />Arwel also had the Emperor-slayer sword.  He was part of a group that was hired to transport the sword, but they were under attack when the quake happened.  Not sure how it got to them (or if it's even the exact same sword).  But the sword<br /><br />Haroun is new to me.  He's a sickly Genasi Geomancer with a mix of Earth and Water.  I'm not sure what he story is.  He's lived a sheltered life, and seems to have sacrificed his heath to be a prophet.  Arwel is acting as his guide and has been working to educate him about the world.  I would love to get a chance to learn more, but he'll have to warm up to me first.<br /><br />As we traveled, we managed to find a clue in the attack.  We found the spot where a single orc expanded over and over again to form the army.  I could tell that the effect came from the nearby techno-prophet city. <br /><br />We were headed near that direction anyways, so we continued.  Haroun proved to be a liability here though.  He didn't want to go near the city, but it's not safe to leave people in the wilderness, and there really is no other place to go.  Joseph tried to disguise him, but the rest of us provided our own little touches.  He looked like a straight water genasi by the time we were done.<br /><br />Our trip to the city provided a fun diversion.  I wish I could have stayed longer.  We stopped by a tavern by the entrance.  Thankfully it was early, and not many people were around.  I bought a few drinks for Haroun and Arwel while the rest of us left to take care of business.<br /><br />Ed went to the library, while I took Kith and Joseph to the nexus.  I studied the nexus for a few minutes to see that the affected orc did pass through the nexus, it didn't originate here.  I was approached by a local geomancer mentioned that someone teleported into the city through the nexus on an errand around that time, and it was possible that the orc used that to piggyback passage.  Not much is known about the person or the errand though.<br /><br />An effect like this could only come from a very powerful geomancer, or group of geomancers.  Seems like the source was further into the woods, but we couldn't tell more than that.  Also, we had no idea who could have been involved in something like this.  We discussed the idea that the current quakes are the result of the magics used in this assault, and given the power required, might be on the mark.  But this kind of power is unprecedented, at least in my experience.<br /><br />?? (not sure exactly how this played out (or if it matters))<br /><br />We returned to the geomancer at the nexus with Arwel's sword.  She explains that this was supposed to be it's ultimate destination, and they wanted to study it.  (I wonder if they have caught wind of Iraja's prophesy?). <br /><br />Haroun saw that someone was after the sword in the city.  The geomancer graced us with a few enchantments (pass without trace) and we were out the door.  We're to take the sword to Terminus.  Yay...  Since we need to stay hidden, it will take almost a year to get there. <br /><br />Not long after, Haroun received a message that our destination has been compromised, and we are to just stay hidden and keep the sword safe.  We change our plans and start heading towards an independent city bu the swamp.  I haven't explored the swamp, so I am looking forward to this.<br /><br />---- Questions<br /><br /> Who are we running from?<br /><br />How did they know the sword was there?<br /><br />How did they find out where we were going, and so quickly?<br /><br />Why do the techo-prophets want the sword now?  How long have they been looking for it?<br /><br />What do they (the techno-prophets)  want to do with it?<br /><br />Are the techno-prophets dupes for a powerful geomancer, or are they connected to the army?<br /><br />Who was on the errand, what was the errand, and is there any connection there?</p>

      <p>Kithlandil the guide.<br /><br />There once was a wee tiny person named Kithlandil. He was part man, and part bug! <br /><br />Well, Kithlandil was leading some very strange people through a very dangerous place. <br /><br />See the Tall Tall Tall Halfling! He speaks to the runes and to his ghostly daughter.<br /><br />See the Metal Warrior! It smashes and pounds, and sees many places.<br /><br />See the Sickly Prophet! He bumbles and cringes, and remembers the future.<br /><br />See the Devout Scaley Woman! She holds the ancient sword, and wards the prophet.<br /><br />See the Pretty Lady! She is Kithlandil's bestest friend ever!<br /><br />They walked, and they walked, and they walked some more, planning and plotting to protect the sword.<br /><br />Where would they take it?<br /><br />To the City! said the sword's warden. We'll keep it safe there!<br /><br />To the Feywild! said the Pretty Lady. It will be a grand adventure!<br /><br />To the center of the earth! said dour and stodgy Kithlandil. No one will find it there.<br /><br />No! said the Prophet. It will surely be lost in the center of the earth!<br /><br />No! said the Halfling. The Feywild is dangerous!<br /><br />So the stout party went to the City, as the warden had advised.<br /><br />But the sword was not safe in the City, for the city could not protect it.<br /><br />Go! Fly far away! Take it across the land, far from this place!<br /><br />So the adventurers left the City, to cross the land.<br /><br />Woe, woe, woe to the guardians of the sword! For before you and behind you it is lost!<br /><br />To the Swamp! said the Warrior. I have not been there, and it is a place of great power.<br /><br />To the swamp they went, each keeping their secrets in their hearts.<br /><br />But Kithlandil was watching...</p>

      <p>Journal of Joesph Vernor</p><p>(you again skip ahead to the next entry)</p><p>Entry 9: Confessions</p><p>Another day of firsts.&nbsp; I think this is the first time I've ever talked about that night before.&nbsp; To anyone who didn't then start throwing my stuff around with telekinesis.&nbsp; Simone somehow knew about our pasts, maybe some kind of Geomantic power?&nbsp; I just started gushing about it.&nbsp; They took it very well suprisingly.&nbsp; I mean, I turn people into withered undead!&nbsp; At the very least I leave them 'crippled' for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; All to give a second chance at life to street urchins I find.&nbsp; Just cause of my guilt about Anne.</p><p>Thats the other thing!&nbsp; Anne played hide and go seek with&nbsp;Simone.&nbsp; That...I...don't have any frame of reference here.&nbsp; I've never seen her playful before.&nbsp; Maybe its because of Simone's charisma, maybe its cause she is a fellow elf?&nbsp; Maybe I&nbsp;need to lighten up and be more of a companion to her then a 'master'.&nbsp; How do I get her out of her shell more?&nbsp; I think I should try and involve her more with the group, so that she has an opportunity to interact with others more.&nbsp; But I think I'm also going to try talking with her more.&nbsp; Maybe in meditation?&nbsp; We'll see.</p><p>I&nbsp;also learned some interesting facts about my companions, namely that Sahrit knows that Necromancer who killed me.&nbsp; He called it something strange...Lich.&nbsp; There is something oddly fitting about calling it that.&nbsp; He also called it by name, Vance Doubain, I must do as much research as possible to learn more about this figure.&nbsp; I have a feeling I will meet him again, and this time he will kill me more permanently.&nbsp; Maybe this name will lead me to those other two figures?</p><p>Then, suddenly, another quake happened.&nbsp; Another BIG one.&nbsp; And just like that Sahrit and Biger were gone, and in their place were a large Dragonborn and a sickly looking Eladrin.&nbsp; The Dragonborn is female if my placing of crest coloration is correct, but its always hard to tell with the lizards.&nbsp; Coloration is odd however, what kind of breathweapon is possesses is totally up in the air.&nbsp; The Eladrin seems to be have traits of both Earth and Water elementals, another odd figure.</p><p>More interestingly though, was the weapon the Dragonborn(Arwell) was carrying.&nbsp; It seems it was the same sword used to kill the emperor.&nbsp; Possibly its what caused all the Dragonborn to become ill during the assault.&nbsp; How it ended up in her possession is unknown however.&nbsp; Those necromancers were also apparently intersted in it.&nbsp; I&nbsp;should probably study the sword myself, so&nbsp;I might better understand my foes desire.</p><p>The Eladrin(Haroun) is very odd.&nbsp; I would almost place him as being mentally deficient, but Arwell insists that he is mearly sheltered.&nbsp; Whatever it is, he seems to be some form of prophet?</p><p>More interestingly, it seems they know Isaline.&nbsp; In fact they were traveling with her when the shift happened.&nbsp; Could we be part of some kind of link between others traveling elsewhere?&nbsp; I should try to talk with Arwell about this, so that we can know what to expect if we get shifted as well.&nbsp; If we are to expect further shifts like this, we should be prepared to work with them.</p><p>We decided to continue our tracking of the orcs, and went on our way, hopefully we will be able to get some answers.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have a bad feeling that sword will lead further trouble our way though.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Entry 10: Growth</p><p>Its hard to pinpoint the actual reason, but I think it might have something to do with my close brush with death at Eloyes.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have made leaps and bounds with my magical study, all of my runes are much crisper and less wasteful now that I&nbsp;have been practicing like this every night.&nbsp; I think I've even found a way to increase my ability to store undead essence, but its not easy to do.&nbsp; I shall have to work on that process.&nbsp; I was able to extend the distance I can travel with my Shadow Jump however.&nbsp; I'm sure that will come in handy.</p><p>Anne has remained quiet after her little jaunt with Simone, but I expect she is shy now that we have two newcomers.</p><p>Arwell allowed me to study the blade however.&nbsp; Very interestingly, it seems related to my withered necromancy.&nbsp; I&nbsp;felt I might be able to wither/unwither through the sword, as opposed to my normal limit of physical touch.&nbsp; However, I couldn't help but notice the similarity between this sword and the kind of power that left that mark on Sahrit's shoulder.&nbsp; Whoever made this sword was unbelievably powerful.&nbsp; And for what purpose, I&nbsp;have no idea.&nbsp; It certainly wasn't for the cheap parlor tricks I&nbsp;do.&nbsp; I fear its true purpose is some kind of genocide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Entry 11: Origin</p><p>We found the orc origin point finally, and as we suspected they appeared out of nowhere.&nbsp; Some kind of teleportation effect it seems?&nbsp; Maybe thats how those weird orcs happened, they got lost somehow during transit through the nexus/leylines and became horribly corrupted with its energies.&nbsp; But my expertese is decidedly not within the realms of Geomancy, so I could be totally wrong there.</p><p>Simone mentioned that they seemd to somehow...duplicated from a single orc who appeared in the woods here.&nbsp; Once they finished, they built a camp and seige weapons and made their way towards Eloyes.</p><p>So powerful was whatever effect used on the orcs to do this, that even now it was still lingering.&nbsp; Chilling that we seem to be putting ourselves in such a foes path.</p><p>Simone was able to discern the direction of the origin point of the orc/s teleportation, and we have set off in that direction.&nbsp; Hopefully the closest Technoprophet city will have more answers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Entry 12: Kill it with Fire</p><p>Sometimes I wonder how I got wrapped up in these events, other then my damnable curiousity.&nbsp; I suppose thats what drove me to explore my magic, but still, I seem to be looking at eventual confrontations with an unbelievably powerful cabal of Necromancers and possibly a powerful cabal of Geomancers.&nbsp; Or just an increadibly strong one.</p><p>We got many of the answers we were seeking in the Technoprophet city of [CITY].&nbsp; It seems Haroun was very distraught at traveling within one, but because of my spectacular disguising skills with a little bit of Simone's help, we were able to hide his identity.&nbsp; Kinda wish she'd used the billowing cloak though.</p><p>Anyways, I traveled with Simone to the Nexus to ask about the orcs.&nbsp; On the way I suddenly had a cat in my haversack.&nbsp; I...really hope I'm not going crazy and that it is Kith's doing.&nbsp; I don't need any more phobias about random cats.</p><p>We found out that apparently they had a breach of sorts and that the orc got teleported without their knowledge, which doesn't impress me about the security.&nbsp; But then we are talking about foes that are strong enough to somehow compress an army of orcs into one body...but I'm getting ahead of myself.</p><p>We were eventually called away by Ed, who had found a gnome, who seemed to be fairly knowledgable about these matters.&nbsp; I tried asking him about what he might know about the necromancers, but...sadly he just kept suggesting to burn things.&nbsp; Considering I&nbsp;am a necromancer, I felt a tad bit uncomfortable.&nbsp; Sadly I think I may have encouraged him to build some kind of Weapon of Mass Destruction centered on Fire.</p><p>(some sketched runes that seem to be focused on ways of defending oneself from fire)</p><p>However he was quite a bit more knowledgeable about the events surrounding the sword and the orcs.&nbsp; In fact it seemed this was the city that was to have recieved the sword, but the line ship that was carrying it disappeared.</p><p>Ed went off to inform Arwel, who joined us shortly.&nbsp; The gnome then took us to the people who were to recieve the sword, which turned out to be the woman we were speaking with earlier.&nbsp; Arwel produced the sword, and put the woman into a state of shock it seemed.</p><p>Apparently they were to have studied the blade there, but after the attacks on the Line ship and Eloyes, we did not feel the city would be safe with the sword present.&nbsp; She agreed and told us to take the city on a more then 12 month journey to Terminus!&nbsp; And thats if we were to cut directly through the Wastes and the Empire.</p><p>We think that perhaps the orc attack was meant as a way to get the empire to go to full war with the Technoprophets, perhaps to mask their actions somewhat.&nbsp; Whatever they are.</p><p>About a day out of the Technoprophet city, it seems our fears and Haroun's prophecy were correct, as the woman gain contacted Arwel, to inform her that our destination was known, and that we need to simply keep the sword out of our enemies hands.&nbsp; Well, at least our journey will be shorter.</p><p>We are going to try to go to the closest independant city, and figure out where to go from there.&nbsp; Maybe the oracle mentioned by the gnome could possibly help, though he seemed pretty adament about how we shouldn't go there.&nbsp; About as adament as he was about setting fire to necromancers.</p><p>I'm going to spend tonight trying to teach Anne her basic runes.&nbsp; I'm trying to give her some kind of basic education, to see if any of the knowledge will stay with her.&nbsp; If it does, it means it might be possible to help her mature, to prevent her destruction from her permanent innocence.</p>

Barnabas has been through a lot more than the bear.&nbsp; When Sahret is asked About fochlucan he's evasiove.&nbsp; Vance Doubain Betrayed the College.&nbsp; Is that the man in the dark brown cloak?&nbsp; Sahret doesn't know exactly<br /><br />Nomad Settlement Fochlucan:&nbsp; The fochlucans were conducting some experiment on a node that went badly.<br /><br />When I'm addressed...&nbsp; I let Simone know that I don't know what the crank is for or what it does.&nbsp; I also say I don't totally know who the gold cloaked person is<br /><br />With the mention of the crank, the grig Suddenly looks like he wants to turn it.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp; <br /><br />When Ed is addressed:&nbsp; Simone Mentions that he's done a lot...&nbsp; And he mentions he's only 3 years old.&nbsp; The trials on ed...&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone mentions that she sees through to Ed's past. Remember, the idea of &quot;The&quot; past is loose.&nbsp; <br /><br />The larger warforged ed fights with is Alpha...&nbsp; Ed's brother.&nbsp; Ed was created to train alpha, and that's what he did.&nbsp; Ed was out on a mission with an eladrin from their city, who was assigned both of them, and think it was a good idea for alpha to train...&nbsp; And that's probably when they were fighting together.&nbsp; The flying machine:&nbsp; It replaced the eladrin woman...&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened within the feywood, not far from here.&nbsp; We now know where it was.&nbsp; Ed sent Alpha back to the city to send a report.&nbsp; The City Solicitus.&nbsp; He was mapping the nexuses and ley lines.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone addresses Joe: &quot;So how long have you been able to absorb people&quot;... 'since I started learning magic... after I left the village.'&nbsp; &quot;I've seen that you can promote or retard withering&quot; 'to an extent yes...'&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But it balances out... can't make it... but can 'steal' withering or youth.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What's it like being withered&quot;&nbsp; 'Mostly, I feel tired.&nbsp;&nbsp; I usually don't attempt to unwither a person to that extent.' 'I'm somewhat partial to people who wither does.&nbsp; Wrin Mentions that Humans are extinct species.&nbsp; Joe lived in a village of humans, and there was no withering, no nexuses.&nbsp; People Did not age.&nbsp; There was no withering in his village.&nbsp; And then the day happened, and his village was gone...&nbsp; Then a runemage taught him the magic.&nbsp; There were no quakes either in his village.&nbsp; Hadn't even heard of them.&nbsp; We know now the location of his village.&nbsp; His first village was like in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; It was in the wastes, except it was more developed.&nbsp; It was an oasis town.&nbsp; Does a nexus to anything to Joe?&nbsp; Joe has met one other human (Well, two, because Jesse's character as well)...&nbsp; Neither of them have gotten the power to affect withering.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe has an affinity over withered undead.&nbsp; The ones he summons are stored within him.&nbsp; When he fully withers someone, they are then stored within him, and then he can use them up to use their abilities from life.&nbsp; He has used it fewer than 5 times.&nbsp; He withers bandits and the like.&nbsp; And he seems reluctant to.&nbsp; The tentacle orc didn't give Joe indigestion... it was just more filling. He can use it to consume undead&nbsp; as well (He can absorb any withered undead, very easily actually).&nbsp; He also has a companion that we haven't exactly met... but well, one of us have.&nbsp; Joe focuses for a bit.&nbsp; Joe holds a conversation with himself &quot;They know who I am now&quot;...&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually a solemn translucent girl appears.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the girl from Joe's past.&nbsp; Named Ann...&nbsp;&nbsp; She cowers behind Joe as much as an incorporeal creature can.&nbsp; Wearing long rags, has long hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; She has pointed ears poking through her hair.&nbsp; How did you two meet (To the ghost, by Ed). Ann is special.&nbsp; She was a child before being dead.&nbsp; She does not detect as evil.&nbsp; (She detects as withered undead... This makes her the only withered undead that isn't evil that anyone knows of like at all ever).&nbsp; She likes Simone... doesn't much like Kith... Asks Simone to play.&nbsp; Ann asks to play Hide and Seek.&nbsp; Joe has an undead halo kinda around his head.&nbsp; *((Nate:&nbsp; You're like Zombie Jesus!&quot;)).&nbsp; Joe has made enemies.&nbsp; Joe met the necromancer at the same time as he met ann.&nbsp; She's how he survived the city... She's as tied to his powers as he is.&nbsp; She is a part of him, unlike the eaten ones.&nbsp; The necromancer he met attempted to Kill Joe.&nbsp; In order to get his bones in use of an artifact./.. which he expressed as odd, but because of his connection to Ann, he escaped.&nbsp; The Lich was a human.&nbsp; He doesn't have control over withered undead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Connection with dwarven necromancer unknown (OTher than they're all necromancers).&nbsp; Joe was struck down by the Lich, but then was brought back by Ann.&nbsp; Joe has NEVER seen ann happy, so her being happy by playing with Simone is pretty cool.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lich is Vance Doubain...&nbsp; Yes, that guy.&nbsp; Simone actually finds ann as she's incorporeal and invisible...&nbsp; Ann is surprised....&nbsp; zooms back over to Joe, dissapearing into Joe's face.&nbsp; Her essence was kinda absorbed back into his head/halo.&nbsp; Joe Killed Her...&nbsp; That's what he's atoning for.&nbsp; When He was first experimenting, he discovered how painful it was to be withered, and it was the first time he ever did such a ting, and he panicked and withered someone else, and it was all euphoric, so he Pumped her full of witheredness.&nbsp; He killed her as a result.&nbsp; Atoning for this is really his primary motivation.&nbsp; He believes he can do a lot of good.&nbsp; He can stop from withering someone else... but it's hard...&nbsp; This is not a skill he knows how to teach someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe's mentor explained that Joe's magic shouldn't work that way.&nbsp; His summoning magic works like so:&nbsp; When He brings out the undead he's captured, it's very important that he's not disturbed, or he'll probably lose control.&nbsp; Joe can power his spells beyond that of a normal runemage with these undead souls.&nbsp; (It's generally beleived that people have souls, and withered have no souls... the souls of people who withered move on... is the popular believe).&nbsp; Intelligent withered are strange, then, because they have no souls... corrupted souls though are twisted as a result of being undead.&nbsp; Joe really does want to help her.&nbsp; But he does also want to know where the humans have gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Wrin says humans are an extinct species/.. seperate block (Or was it stock).&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />At this point Biger is whisked away by a quake</p>

      <p>PART 2 of session:<br />When the quake subsides both Sahrit and Biger have disappeared, and in there place there now stands (Allen) and (Kelsey).<br />(Allen) seems to know Simone and asks their location.&nbsp; It seems they have come from a group that Isaline appeared in.<br />Character introductions commense.&nbsp; It seems (Allen) is carrying the sword that killed the emperor, that the Necromancers were so interested in.<br />(Allen) says they were in a town 2 months north of Blue parties current location.&nbsp; Tat'enda<br />Simone explains what occured in Elyoise to (Allen).<br /><br />(Kelsey) used Detect Significance on the party, and determines the entire party registers.<br /><br />The party discusses the significance of the sword.&nbsp; Specifically the effect it had on the Dragonborn in Eloyise.<br />(Kelsey) is revealed to not understand Warforged, and attempts to understand Eidylol better.&nbsp; Kith is rude, and suggests Haroun is soft-headed.<br />The two new members apparently need to travel to Arwel's hometown to deliver the evil sword of evilness.<br />The Blue party explains of the encounter with the Pseudo-natural orcs.<br />The party decides to move on in the path of the army.&nbsp; Weeks pass, in the meantime...<br /><br />Simone studies Arwel, but cannot see beyond the sword.&nbsp; Somehow it is in all points of history, killing important peoples.&nbsp; Most of whom were Emperors.<br />When studying Haroun, she sees an Illadrin that she recognizes.<br /><br />During some of the nights Arwell appears to be training Haroun.<br /><br />Joesph examines the sword, and discovers is it similar to his wither powers.&nbsp; He thinks he could wither through the device, but it was meant for much more.<br />It is also very similar to Sahrit's undead touch on his shoulder.<br /><br />Eidylol asked who hired the two newcomers to deliver the sword, it was the city of Arx.<br /><br />The party discovers the origin on the orcs, and there seems to be a lingering aura of magic, even so long after the appearance of the orcs.<br />Simone discovers that the army seemingly originated from a single orc, who somehow became many.&nbsp; And she thinks he originated in the West.<br />Intempestivus seems to be the closest city, and it is Technoprophet.&nbsp; This seems to be an issue with the new members of the group.<br /><br />Haroun seems to not want to 'go back', and Arwel will not leave his side.<br /><br />The party has not been attacked during their travels, and Kith is pretty sure it is because he has been recognized.<br /><br />During the travels Haroun has recived several visions of traveling through unfamiliar terrain.&nbsp; It feels almost wrong, and is traveling next to a river which might just be a path.<br />Sometimes he has a companion, which changes.&nbsp; He doesn't quite know what to make of it.<br /><br />Arwel offers to hammer out the dents in Eidylol, who declines.<br /><br />Joesph offers to study Haroun's sickness but he is very uncomfortable with the idea and declines.&nbsp; It seems he feels he should be sick to remain a prophet.<br /><br />When the party nears the city Joesph attempts to disguise Haroun to allay the Prophet's fears of discover with great glee, when he finishes Simone ACTUALLY disguises the Prophet as a simple water elemental.<br /><br />Simone addresses top of the wall of the Technoprophet city, and a guard appears.&nbsp; She addresses the guard and requests entry, who accepts.&nbsp; The wall opens and the party enters the city.<br />The city is unusually well organized.&nbsp; It fits Fae standards as well as Technoprophet.<br /><br />The party finds an inn, and inside there is a warforged.&nbsp; Simone buys drinks, and rooms.&nbsp; The party splits up.<br />Simone, Kith(as a cat), and Joesph head towards the nexus.&nbsp; The two newcomers stay in the inn.&nbsp; Eidylol heads to the library.<br /><br />Eidylol doesn't enunciate properly to the warforged and learns about the way half-orcs are born.&nbsp; He wishes he could forget.<br /><br />Upon reaching the nexus there are several Geomancers at the nexus.&nbsp; Simone uses divination to study the Nexus.&nbsp; During the study, one of the geomancers comes over and is curious about the study.<br />Simone tells the geomancer, and she says there was one who made 'unauthorized' use of teleportation magic.<br />She(the geomancer) says someone came through on an errand, and it is possible that someone followed them in.<br />There was a single orc that traveled through the teleporter, empowered with some kind of powerful effect.<br />Discussion of a possible unbelievably powerful geomancer who has masterminded this orc attack.&nbsp; It is possible the technoprophet city is being framed by this individual.<br />(Elise) was seen traveling through the city, but her involvement is not known.<br />A town to the north was also attacked similarly.<br /><br />It is discussed that the large quakes felt could be delayed quakes from the orc army effect.&nbsp; Simone does not mention how the quakes have affected the party.<br /><br />Eidylol keeps studying possible ways of duplicating sentient people.&nbsp; He finds a gnome which seems to know how.&nbsp; He thought the army would have attacked the TP city, but actually attacked Elyoise.<br />Eventually Eidylol goes off to find Simone to tell her story to the Gnome.<br />The Gnome says that it might have been possible to entwine the orcs together at multiple nexus's.<br />He knows little of Necromancy then &quot;Kill it with fire&quot;.<br />He implies that the city was to recieve the SWORD originally, before a line ship disappeared.<br />Eidylol goes and retrieves Arwel and the SWORD, and stays with Haroun.<br />Arwel goes to meet the gnome, who starts leaving.&nbsp; Simone takes plans of the sword the gnome has made.<br /><br />Suddenly Haroun has a prophecy of someone coming to the city.&nbsp; Specifically to take the SWORD.<br />The main group reaches the nexus, and Arwel gives the sword to the Geomancer there.&nbsp; He explains how the sword came into his possession.<br />The Geomancer is very surprised and asks for information, the party gives it to her.&nbsp; They wish to research the sword in the city, but the party thinks it is a danger to the city.&nbsp; She agrees.<br />Arwel suggests destroying the sword, but it seems they may be transporting it to another city which may be safer.&nbsp; Terminus.<br />Arwel takes an oath to Erathis to protect the sword.&nbsp; To not reveal the existence of the sword, keep it secret keep it safe.<br />Arwel is provided a sheath for the sword, in addition to an enhanted sword.&nbsp; The Geomancer uses pass without trace on the members there, and later on the rest.&nbsp; Kith does no need it.&nbsp; The gnome is named Karit Noggin, and he continues talking about incindiary devices as the party leaves the city.<br /><br />Haroun describes his prophecy to the party.&nbsp; While traveling, Arwel recieves a message from the Geomancer.&nbsp; They know where we were traveling.<br />The party has decided to head towards the independant city near to the swamp. *END*</p>
