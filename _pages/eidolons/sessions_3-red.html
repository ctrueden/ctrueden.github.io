      <p><em>Become a friend to ground beneath your feet. If you fail to know it, it will surely be your foe.</em> -Grandmaster Egorin</p><p>The battle in the hold grew fiercer, and stranger. The delphian nobles were whisked away from the hold, presumably by the same magics which launched us, and the hold, skyward. With some difficulty, we defeated our foes, but not before the weapon found itself in Arwel's hands, but a moment before a quake caused her and Haroun to vanish, an oddly shaped warforged named Biger and a elven man named Sahrit taking their places. Crashed in the sand, our cargo gone, we chose to make for Arx, and attempt to evade the hordes.</p><p>After many hours of traveling, we made camp, though Egorin's words stung we were attacked in the night, a powerful shaman named the Vanquisher having clearly followed our tracks. Sahrit was killed in the attack, and the mage made of with his corpse. Their history is unknown to me, though it would seem he sought the sword that was last seen in Arwel's possesion. I grow concerned for both her and Haroun.</p><p>And now we hope to travel though the road of shadow to speed our journey. Isaline believes this ti be the wisest course of action, though i do not relish continuing to tread forward in a manner I am so ignorant of.</p>

      <p>Well it looks like another shit day descended upon me.&nbsp; The battle in the hold finally ended, but not without more strange occurrences.&nbsp; The gnome crewman launched the hold into the air and when the dragonborn grabbed the blade another switch was made.&nbsp; Biger and an unfavorable character had joined us.&nbsp; We finished the fight in relative short order and found ourselves part buried in the sand by the escape mechanism.</p><p>Escaping from the hordes seemed done, but the Vanquisher showed up again during the night to take Sahrit's corpse.&nbsp; Left with few options we will try the Path of Shadows to reach whatever destination an old friend has chosen for us.&nbsp; Dreams have made it clear that the path should be safe, at least this one time.</p>

      <p>I was wisked away from the &quot;share your feelings&quot; powwow in the forest to the chaos of a combat that I would have been in would it not be that I were thrown half way across the world on a daily basis.&nbsp; It's becoming my understanding that i should get used to this happening regularly, it may perhaps even be an evolution of my condition.&nbsp; Fortunately, the quake also took Kas' sword away to the forests where I was.&nbsp; So, it is safe from the Vanquisher and his hordes, but it is now closer to Vance and his hordes.&nbsp; I think I would have rather seen the Vanquisher have it.</p><p>The nobles I had previous been charged to protect are gone, no matter.&nbsp; The Bardforged seems to have followed in my wake as I got tossed back.&nbsp; The captain and his lieutenant are still here in the fray.&nbsp; Also new to my company now is a Deva and another gods forsaken human.&nbsp; If anything in this world makes sense then this human would be Isaline, the other human the people in the forest talked of.&nbsp; She seems short on years and strangely at easy with it.&nbsp; This is kinda contrary to the human nature I have experienced, but I find it so less interesting.&nbsp; I have had my fill of interesting for my lifetime though.</p><p>The quake has dumped me back in the wastes.&nbsp; I hate it hear.&nbsp; So little sustenance.</p><p>The fight I found myself in was in the line ship that had held the sword.&nbsp; Seeing the fate of many in that battle, I am happy my fortunes took me elsewhere.&nbsp; As we escaped the scene, we decided to head to Arx.&nbsp; The captain and his lieutenant decided to go die near the ship, for honorable reasons, ha.&nbsp; We kept our distance from the ley line except to forage for food.</p><p>Refeshing is nearly impossible now.&nbsp; Arx will be a difficult place to fix this, without some amazing luck and manuvering.</p><p>For now we camp, in a number of days we will be in Arx...</p>

      <p><br />At this point Biger is whisked away<br /><br />Biger and Sahret Are Switched with some other people.&nbsp; I find myself in a hold made of steel and other metals.&nbsp; This is clearly technomagic construction..&nbsp;&nbsp; It's very reminiscent of a Technoprophet city in terms of materials and such.&nbsp; The cieling is closed... there's a hole 10 ft wide that was torn in the place, with an ogre hanging from it... ground to roof.&nbsp; I am definately not on the Ground... Wrin manages to not be fallen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline is fighting some people with some others.&nbsp; Tiefling is an enemy.&nbsp; A heavbily armored guy seems unbothered by the fact that we're in air, he pwns the tiefling, slashing three times.&nbsp; 'Our team' is Isaline, A Deva (Joel's character) (Who shoved an ogre out of the hole).&nbsp; Something shifts...&nbsp; Isaline gets some black wings....&nbsp; We hit something... (Everyone gets shoved around).&nbsp; I feather falled everyone except the ogre, and we all suffered<br /><br />The Tiefling when he dies... some spirit leaves him... soemthing divine... but not a soul... this is irregular.&nbsp; And his form shifts, and now he's an elf, not a tiefling.&nbsp; Sahret casts consumptive field (It's EEEEVVVIIIILLL).&nbsp; The swordsage elf dies... loses its body as a result.&nbsp; <br /><br />&quot;The dragonborn had the sword and it was pulled away...&nbsp; (Arwen)...&quot;&nbsp; This is the sword Sahret was speaking about earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gnome had some kind of bomb.&nbsp; No one here knows what happened with the blade.&nbsp; I introduced myself to Zahard is a mercenary who was guarding this caravan, (Deva).&nbsp; There's not much caravan.&nbsp; The sword was destroyed where we came from.&nbsp; The Gnome pulled a ring off the elf but it vanished shortly after. Pennywig is the gnome.&nbsp; <br /><br />THe Captain says &quot;Let's try to reach the surface&quot;.&nbsp; We're outside of Arx.&nbsp; (In the wastelands).&nbsp; Banthiel is the captain's name.&nbsp; <br /><br />They were attacked in this caravan.&nbsp; A line ships cargo hold which was torn open by some tribal ogres.&nbsp;&nbsp; This hold was ejected.&nbsp; Zahard Mentions that the empire divine stuff happened, and the one that the captain killed vanished as Deva's do.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Checking the barbarian for Loot:&nbsp; He looks to be wearing stuff not Dissimilar to the orcs that we fought.&nbsp; He was wielding a magic greatclub and magic hide.&nbsp; He is not fromt he same tribe of the orcs that we fought down in the feywood.&nbsp; This ogre has a rare tatoo, from an elite clan: a member of the warriors of the Flayed Skull... A skull with cracks in it.&nbsp; The Vanquisher leads this leaders...&nbsp; THey are a clan of ogres, but their leader is a medium size humanoid of unclear origin.&nbsp; <br /><br />We take the Tiefling turned elf.&nbsp; <br /><br />The captain wants to go down iwith his ship...&nbsp; He will attempt to Go to Arx afterwards, and suggests that we do so as well.&nbsp; We'll get to Arx to try and plan the next step.&nbsp; Arx is several weeks away on foot.&nbsp; Arx is north of here, slightly west.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask if there was any razortooth...&nbsp; Zahard knows the blackspear tribe... he fought their leader... that was here... the goblin warlock they fought also was blackspear.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sahret is Slower than before and is now casting evil spells.&nbsp; Sahret looks the same, though.&nbsp; Sahret glows so very evil.&nbsp; The Nightmare detects as eeeevil... <br />BBarnabas is not evil.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Sahret Meditates instead o foraging.&nbsp; Sahret does Geomancy stuff.&nbsp; <br />Biger accepts Sahret's resting thing to sleep 2 less.<br /><br />Watches: (4 2 hours watches)<br />1: Wrin, Bella, Biger,&nbsp; <br />2: Wrin, Bella, Biger, Za'har<br />3: Wrin, Bella, Za'har, Sahret<br />4: Wrin, Bella, Za'har, Barnabas<br /><br />&nbsp; Something tries to affect my mind.&nbsp; A blast of cold energy washes over all of us...&nbsp; We didn't hear any casting.&nbsp; A figure appears...&nbsp; There's a vanquisher here... He's a pain in the ass.&nbsp; He's hovering in the air.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sahret Is damaged by my channel positive energy burst.&nbsp; He blows up, and Barnabas (After looking confused) Disappears exactly as that tiefling did. The attacker Moves to Get nate's corpse, teleports away with it (Using a SLA, again)<br /><br />Why were we moving the sword manually?&nbsp; WEll, it wasn't teleported because it might have been corrupted... it may not have been immunized?&nbsp; I tell this to the toerh party members.&nbsp; The Sword melted away from the emperor...&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sahret Mentioned that the sword was destroyed and the necros were after it).&nbsp; There are apparently multiple swords.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Vanquisher.&nbsp; He may Come back to get the sword.&nbsp; So he knows that teleporting with artifcacts is hard, maybe...&nbsp; Why is he here...&nbsp; <br /><br />Jesse's character dreams of the man who caused nates death..&nbsp;&nbsp; A bird atacks him, tearing him apart, and then the bird fills his vision.&nbsp; he senses a commanding presence, and an unquestionable feeling of confidence... It instills the confidence into you.&nbsp; She sees the quasi-real path of shadow.&nbsp; She is confident that this once, at least, the path will be safe for us.&nbsp; <br /><br />We moved camp and rested.&nbsp; We decide to do the shadow walk from Bella.&nbsp; Bella seems anxious and excited.&nbsp; Isiline gathers us up. We are safely secured to Bella.&nbsp; The area of shadow we were camped in broils a bit and turns into an inky black door... dark silver light comes out... and there's a silvery path... on the path is a bear... And in front of him lies an unconscious form.&nbsp;</p>
