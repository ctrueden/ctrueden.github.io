      <p><br />9/04/2009<br /><br />The form was Sahret, Barnabas looks like he's waiting for us.&nbsp; I indicate maybe I should try healing again, and The bear emphatically says:&nbsp; no.&nbsp; Barnabas then licks Sahret's face and Sahret wakes up, uninjured. <br /><br />I see a flittering down and to the left of the path.&nbsp; There's a little shadowy bird... as it gets closer... it becomes less abstract and the shadowy sorta smoke blows away.. its a raven and it lands right on Isalines armor.&nbsp; <br /><br />There's a silvery path. The raven Quorks (Makes a noise) Like it was expecting something.&nbsp; The Raven has a note, which Isaline takes and reads.&nbsp; <br /><br />Here, we do not feel threatened, but nice and calm, like at a graveyard at night.&nbsp; The Raven flies off, but the path remains.&nbsp; We follow the path for what seems like hours.&nbsp; It was a lengthy, but we got neither tired nor hungry.&nbsp; Eventually, the winding twisted path and loop-the loops, we find another door, closed and made of shadow.&nbsp; THe shadow realm seemed like a place you shouldn't be without guidance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Open the door, and there's a swamp...&nbsp; And two people (Gwenvyth Trieleffyn Tal'Arabep [Elise's character], Rebin [Ryan's character]<br /><br />We are in... the swamp...&nbsp; so we're probably in the main swamp in the world... It's Mordawen which is north of the lake... and its a place you DO NOT GO!<br /><br />Gwen asks me &quot;What in the name of Boccob is that&quot;?&nbsp; I know who Boccob is... I introduce myself... we introduce eachother around (Thanks to Sahret).&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;(Gwen is evil, but a kinda petty kind)<br /><br />Isaline Revealed an everburning torch, and as its light shines, Belladone (Isaline's nitemare), there's a hag.&nbsp; And surroudning her are two glowing balls of light which weren't there a moment a go.<br /><br />'Greetings, travelers.'&nbsp; <br /><br />We all sense that this person's got anticipation and malevolance.&nbsp; She's definately a hag... (A green hag, specifically... they're usually cunning and evil and will try and trick people)... and she's very at home in the water. The glowing orbs around her are will-o-wisps.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />She's probably not very friendly.&nbsp; <br /><br />The hag says she wishes to help us, as long as we help her.&nbsp; She is totally Bullshitting us (She doesn't really want to help us).&nbsp; <br /><br />Reban says we should just kinda go and leave her be...&nbsp; she's really not offering anything of note, after all.<br /><br />She says &quot;At least trade with me.&nbsp; I don't see visitors often.&quot;&nbsp; Her bones creak.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline asks where Waugrim and the necromancers are looking in the wild.&nbsp; Isaline donates some blood.&nbsp; <br /><br />The hag has a small cracked bowl of ebony and some other components.&nbsp; Something big is moving through the underbrush in this direction.&nbsp; The Hag looks startled and says &quot;Quickly, Away from it!&quot;&nbsp; The hag Knows a lot more about what this is than she's letting on.<br /><br />Sahret Hears his bear's thought. <br /><br />Big thing is a fucking hydra.&nbsp; Its an 8 headed hydra.&nbsp; Hydras are usually neutral (No smiting, alas).<br /><br />Isaline drops the hag in a single turn... Hag falls into the muck. <br /><br />A Chuul Comes out of the water.&nbsp; Then another one does.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar Does sapphire nightmare blade!&nbsp; Later, His hands bust into flames and he scream/cries/smashes.&nbsp; He gets dragged into the water by the Chuul (After being paralyzed), and is rescued by Biger/Wrin, who jumped in after him, and removed paralysis on him.<br /><br /><br />We find some magic items:&nbsp; <br /><br />On the drowned adventurer:&nbsp; Animated large steel shield +1, Shadow breastplate +1, ring of prot +1, Mace of shock +1 (Isaline takes this). And a holy symbol of Corellon.<br /><br />On the hag:&nbsp; Ring of animal friendship, rod of flame extinquishing, a golembane scarab, horseshoes of the zephyr, bead of force. Handy haversack.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'll take the horseshoes of the zephyr and use them on Wrin (OKayed by Curt).&nbsp; So now even when not phantom steeded he'll be able to hover 4 inches off the ground.&nbsp; <br /><br />We bury and give a Eulogy to The dead adventurer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I cast phantom steeds (So does Gwen.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar rides <br /><br />Above the swamp:&nbsp; Above the canopy, it's dark... there's something about this place that's unnatural and glomy, and we see about say... 100 feet... rising beyond the canopy is a magnificent structure... it blends in with the night...&nbsp;&nbsp; Its very difficult to see, but we can kinda see it.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all hear &quot;Zahar!&quot;<br /><br />Zahar says &quot;Arwel!&quot; in recognition of the voice.&nbsp; There's a magical layer at the canpy which blocks trees.&nbsp; <br /><br />The palace is 100 feet to the north.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel and the others are here.&nbsp; The whole team is here.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Including Arwel, Who I've not met, and Kelsey's character, Haruhn, who is a small, slight genasi who has glowing eyes and loks water-earthy.&nbsp; He's got the complexion of a earth genasi, but the aura of a water one).&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; Multiple humans here! Character introductions all round.&nbsp; Half eladrin/half dwarf, 290 lb guy, swashbuckler.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel:&nbsp; A female dragonborn...&nbsp;&nbsp; adamantine full plate:&nbsp; Has a symbol with a symbol of saint Cuthbert.&nbsp; Has blue dye on top of her head.&nbsp; Her horse is clearly summond.&nbsp; <br /><br />Gwen is very elven, but kinda tall, well fed, dark complexion (Very dark... like gary dark skin...&nbsp;&nbsp; White hair...&nbsp;&nbsp; noble clothing).&nbsp; <br /><br />Symbol of of Allyria.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />This might be the prophet:&nbsp; Living in this swamp, and they're looking for the prophet.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other party spent weeks getting here. <br /><br />Gwen's face looks very guilty when the fact that the orc army was compressed into orcs Is mentioned.&nbsp; Maybe that one orc was inoculated.&nbsp; Maybe it split up a bit resulting in those crazy tentacle orcs.&nbsp; They had to go out of that town because someone found out the party had the sword.&nbsp; <br /><br />There were clearly multiple swords, at this point...&nbsp; now, there may just be the one... maybe each of the uber quakes makes another... or one duplicate is just from quakeness.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ahren Was shy, introduced himself to Biger at Arwels urging.&nbsp; We small talked...&nbsp; He calls prophecy easy to understand and has a very strange point of view.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel seems unnerved by Biger's unique construction.<br /><br />Talked with ed... its been several months since we last met.&nbsp; Also, if any gnoll rangers are following us, scare them away, try not to kill them.&nbsp; And Another warforged was sent to escort Ahren but wasn't very good at it.&nbsp; He's destroyed now.<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
