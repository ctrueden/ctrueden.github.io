      <p>"You wander where you wil", and "you have as many ends as there are paths".  What rubbish.  Well, both of those are true, in that obvious, night comes after day kinda way.  But when seeing the great Priestess of the Black, hidden aware in her fortress, deep in the swamp, surrounded by treasures from the ages decides to give us a taste of her power, this is what she comes up with?<br /><br />When I received my private audience, I asked to know a little more about the guild I joined up with.  I figured this was a good test.  After a momentary trace, she mentioned that they were dangerous, and that they sought control.  Again, nothing I didn't know already.  The surprising thing was how she was left shaken and instructed that I never ask about them of her again.<br /><br />Sure, most of the others had questions, and most of them seemed to get better answers, but from what I heard, most of the questions were about the past or the present.  In that respect, her ability to know things is impressive (if, indeed, she did actually know these things), but she may just have an impressive list of informants.  After all, our travels could have easily drawn some attention. <br /><br />Like I said, most of the others seemed to overvalue her advise.   Arwel gave her the sword.  I'm not sure if this was a good idea or not, but I'm not sure that I care.  I'm just glad to be rid of it.  I'm glad it led us here, and it was quite the journey, but it's time for the next adventure.  At least we didn't give into her interest in Haroun.<br /><br />Speaking of adventures, half of the people there got roped into a fools mission of killing the king of the front giants.  Our lovely seer helped teleport them there, but then they were to seek advice of another seer, without revealing the involvement of the current one.  What kind of game is she up to?  I'm just glad to have no part in it.<br /><br />She was also after Sahrit's knowledge of the ritual to extract the heart of a nexus.  I'm not sure where he learned that trick, or how she does not, but if she doesn't, I don't really want her to find out.  Sahrit seemed like he was going to tell her, so Ktih and I did the only thing we could to stop him.  I had already unlocked the crank, and left the turning to Kith.  Unfortunately, he didn't turn it.  He was promised by Pelor's avatar that she would forget again by morning.  I sincerely hope that's the case, though I am saddened that I still don't know first hand what that crank does.<br /><br />Pelor was there, though I'm not entirely sure why.  He seemed content to mostly observe.  That may be the most intrieging mystery of the evening, but I didn't talk with him, so I don't have much of an answer.<br /><br />There were a dozen of us in all, including a few I had not met.  Of these, Gwenvyth is by far the most interesting.  She's a half drow noble from Arx.  She's pretty, and she can talk the talk, but she's also the one who was involved with trasporting the orc.  I'm not sure what her involvement was exactly, or her motivations, but she was involved.<br /><br />She's on a quest to learn of her heritage, and wants to find the city of the Drow &lt;filll in name here&gt;.  The seeker couldn't tell her where to find it (what limitations..), but I left there right before this journey started.  I hope I can use this to get her to follow along on my quest to find the grove.<br /><br />The seer did have something to say on that grove.  First, she wants to know where it is, and was bargining with others to tell her if we found it.  (I just hate the idea of giving her any information she doesn't already have.  Maybe all this wheeling and dealing is how she "sees" things?).  Second, that she used to live there.  And thirdly, we can get there following the river northwest of &lt;town name here&gt;.<br /><br />We could also meet up with an ally there, which interests me, but that is also Haroun's home.  After fleeing and hiding, I doubt anything would convince him to return.<br /><br />Now, my path is clear, to gather up those that weren't foolish enough to chase the frost giant king, and hope they are fooling enough to seek the grove deep in the wilds.</p>

      <p>Heading toward the witch was a bad idea. This much was obvious. But everyone else was determined, and these people were... somehow important.&nbsp; Regardless of the idea, Kith was somewhat confident that the others would be easier prey than him, so he accompanied Simone. <br /><br />Once inside, it was easy to slip into the background for most of the event. It was pleasantly gentle, until the Lady did something profoundly distasteful. To bind people to their oaths with magic was as insulting as bringing cold iron to a moot. Kith waited, bided his time, then confronted her; the answer was unsatisfying. Barely sufficient. Still, she had not brought the wrath of the Fey upon her head, which was, he supposed, good enough. <br /><br />Why was a god here? That was the tricky part. Why would it intervene in mundane, mortal affairs? Obviously it wouldn't, which made the prank all the more... intriguing. There was more to it, and so Kith waited, and watched.<br /><br />Ultimately an uneventful night, except for a gift freely offered. Kith smiled at his new ring. He knew how such things tied you to the giver. He was not convinced that would be a bad idea. <br /><br />No one else needed to know anything... sensitive. He tucked those elements away in his mind.</p>

      <p>(there are very few dedicated entries for many pages, merely some mention of current locations, notes on what does and doesn&rsquo;t work teaching Anne.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem terribly promising so far.&nbsp; However, Joesph seems to have reached a revelation in his study of runes.&nbsp; Their complexity has increased.)<br /><br />Entry 13: Revelations<br />&ldquo;If you wish to save your soul, then you must break the chains.&rdquo;<br /><br />The prophet gave me those words&hellip;and they worry me.&nbsp; The avatar also told me that I was in need of saving.&nbsp; Its unsettling to suddenly have been in the presence of such powerful beings, and to have finally met the others connected to me by destiny.&nbsp; I suppose when she mentions chains, perhaps she is referring in some way to my withering ability.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been spending all this time trying to somehow repent for my mistake, but I am still curious to find my people.&nbsp; Jennifer is alive, but is somehow undetectable by a prophet of destiny.&nbsp; She apparently saved one of my companions, Haroun, so she seems to have changed much since I last saw her.&nbsp; Did she keep studying magic as I have?&nbsp; Or has she walked down the path of the warrior?<br /><br />I have agreed to hunt down the Frost Giant King, partially to get more answers, and partially to get more battle experience.&nbsp; In the company of these people I have learned much about my magic, and if I don&rsquo;t get stronger I will be crushed by those Necromancers.&nbsp; But these warnings tell me that I must walk a fine line, mastering my magic while not overusing my withered.<br /><br />I finally found the a linking style for higher levels of rune spells, well actually I learned it over a month ago but I couldn&rsquo;t manage the strokes until recently.&nbsp; But with this I can finally manage the more complicated spells.<br /><br />I keep trying to spend time talking with Anne, even if she isn&rsquo;t learning anything I want to get to know her better.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve spent so much time with each other, but she only just recently started listening to me at all.&nbsp; I suspect words are inadequate for how she views me.&nbsp; On one hand I am the man who took her life from her in a very horrible and painful way, and on the other I am her guardian of sorts.&nbsp; I am probably the only adult who has ever spent a significant amount of time with her, and our relationship will likely be forever tainted by what I&rsquo;ve done to her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if I will be able to ever forgive myself for what I did to her.<br /><br />I think soon I must confront our issues directly, because I am beginning to enter more and more difficult battles.&nbsp; I have no idea what will happen if I died, whether she would become a wandering ghost or pass on to the next life.&nbsp; However, as loath as I am to consider it, I will likely need her odd abilities to succeed in battle in the future.&nbsp; And if she does attain greater strength through fighting, we may find a way to free her from me if she so wishes it.&nbsp; I have absorbed her body, so resurrection is all but impossible, but dealing with all these powerful being gives me hope that I might be able to have her restored to life.&nbsp; Perhaps then I might be able to provide her the life she deserves to live.&nbsp; The life I tried to give her in the first place.&nbsp; And maybe if she forgives me, I could continue to act as her guardian.&nbsp; Twisted as it is, I find myself thinking of her as a father might.<br /><br />(Notes on the designs of the ebony tower, a sketch of the appearance of the priestess of the black with another sketch below it of a dragon head and a question mark.&nbsp; There are few sparse notes, but they are mostly shorthand references to thought processes.)</p>

      <p>There are things one must be careful of when surrounded by meddlers.&nbsp; My &quot;friends&quot; have difficulty in understanding that this world is in need a vigorous change.&nbsp; I intend to begin these changes.&nbsp; They, it seems, intend to talking about how doing things diferent might destroy the world.</p><p>The deal I have made with Mordellwen is of little consequence to myself.&nbsp; I would have shown her what I had for free, just to make use of the opportunity.&nbsp; This is the first step in a long project, and given the lack of objection by a professed seer, I now believe in the necessity of my course.</p><p>Requesting Gwenvyth's presence was the wisest decision I have made in a a long while.&nbsp; My earnestness has earned me the first of what I hope is many allies.&nbsp; I will need more allies whether I choose to continue my business with these meddlers or not.&nbsp; The question is who is going to be most agreable with this course.</p><p>Haroun is a seer.&nbsp; I don't think he has well developed moral proclivities so his insight, whether agreable or not, would be valued.</p><p>Arwell, I think, can be easily dupped.</p><p>Simone's curiousity would leave me to guess that she would not be immediately hostile, but should she see to oppose me it would be problematic.</p><p>Kith seems like a traditional fey.&nbsp; Having seen me extract a heart once before, I am surprised he has not yet approached me.</p><p>I told Mordellwen that I could not teach her my trick, but that was a small lie.&nbsp; The truth of that I think I will hold out to her for a more elegant dealing then my companions have managed.</p><p>Meanwhile, it seems we might head to Terminus and from there downt he river out into the deep wilds.&nbsp; Mordellwen says there is a place of great power out there and we might find it.&nbsp; I think it might be the place of power of which Vance told me about.</p>

      <p>Well well, it looks like my old friend spoke the truth.&nbsp; The Priestess of the&nbsp;Black has the power to be exceptionally helpful, but her motives and association leave much to be desired.&nbsp; Despite Arwell's bullheadedness the sword is as safe as a damn avatar of Pelor can promise.&nbsp; Her stupidity was highlighted by threatening to leave with both Haroun and the sword.&nbsp; How she thought that could protect him from any of our emerging foes is beyond my reckoning.&nbsp; At least her refusal to enter Imperial lands means our paths part for the time being.&nbsp; Something has happened to Sahrit, but now is not the time to investigate.&nbsp; An excellent meal and a real bed are satisfactory enough considering the mission 'we' accepted.&nbsp; The prophecy of the Priestess only affirms what I believed, but she did have good news about one I have not seen for several years.</p><p>Slaying a frost giant is fine and good, but the king of them all?&nbsp; Truly a battle worthy of remembrance shall be had.&nbsp; It will be&nbsp;difficult and&nbsp;while I do not love serving an agent of Tiamat; the giants are a foe of the Empire&nbsp;so that makes it just a little more palatable.&nbsp; Speaking with my five allies for this mission have eased my doubts and the two warforged willingness to travel into Imperial lands is impressive.&nbsp; Perhaps I have misjudged them, but at least these two are worthy of trusting with my life.&nbsp; I have sworn that should they need to recharge I will do everything in my power to make it happen.</p><p>So now what to take...that Flametongue could be very valuable...but perhaps something more utilitarian.</p>

      <p><br />9/18/2009<br />Session 5<br /><br /><br />Simone tries to turn the crank, but no one notices.<br /><br />THe tower shadowy... and the doors are huge and closed...&nbsp;&nbsp; The doors have handles. &nbsp;<br />Ed knocks on the door... The Door swings open.&nbsp; Inside, the light is from everburning torches. &nbsp;<br />We feel a soft wind Kinda nudging us forward. &nbsp;<br />There are a lot of stairs...&nbsp;&nbsp; enter some double doors and we're in a throne room of sorts.&nbsp; The walls are all richely decorated, there's a fine ed carpet, paintings, etc.&nbsp; Whoever lives here is very wealthy.&nbsp; There is a woman sitting on the throne<br /><br />She is a genasi of a rare type... There are types ther than the main 4 elemental ones... we've never seen one of this type.&nbsp; She has dark hair, and black lines tracing her skin.&nbsp; She's got bling.&nbsp; She's got the nexus charge glow.&nbsp; She's clearly the ruler of this place (As in, the swamp, probably).&nbsp; The name is on the tip of Biger's tongue (As isaline knows, it is the same name as the name of the swamp), she's the priestess of the black (DC 25, I made it).&nbsp; She's the seer. (She detects as evil with detect evil).<br /><br />She smiles Wryly.&nbsp; She accepts our gestures of respect. &nbsp;<br />Please, come closer, so we may speak.&nbsp; She doesn't seem malicious or hostile towards us (Even though she's evil)...&nbsp; She doesn't expect that she needs to do anything unpleasant. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Simone says that she's her because she hadn't been here.&nbsp; Isaline says &quot;For answers&quot;. &quot;This is where my path has led me&quot;...&nbsp; These sorts of answers from the party. &nbsp;<br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp; &quot;Not meaning to be rude, but we would like to know why we are here, from -you're- perspective.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Well, I know exactly why you are here.&nbsp; You have come, because I am the best person to whom you can entrust a sacred artifact.&nbsp; I have seen what is to be.&nbsp; It would be best for it to be left in my hands for the future.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Some among you already know this truth&quot; (Regarding what it would be used for or has been)<br /><br />&quot;Why do the necros want it?&quot; (Joe); reply:&nbsp; &quot;If you want to know, you'd have to do something for me...&nbsp; I may be appeased in a number of ways.&quot;&nbsp; She walks past Arwel and walks to Haruhn and says &quot;Your companion here is indeed delicious... stay with me and then I will tell you what you want to know.&quot;&nbsp; She looks like she has way too much energy within her for good health (Ditto With Haruhn). Haruhn isn't keen on this<br /><br />We all feel the vertigo of a quake, and when it ends, Sahret is still there, but he looks a little different...&nbsp; something subtle. &nbsp;<br /><br />Gwen offers to switch places with haruhn, perhaps.&nbsp; Thinks better of it. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Very well, you wish an alternative&quot; [To leaving Haruhn behind].&nbsp; &quot;I wish to lay my eyes upon the heart of a nexus... I have heard legends that such things are possible&quot;. &nbsp;<br /><br />Bier asks Sahret &quot;What do you know of such a thing&quot; Sahret lies in response &quot;Nothing&quot;<br /><br />She amends her offer: &quot;Teach me how to extract the heart of a nexus myself.&quot;<br /><br />She makes a third option:&nbsp; Bring me the head of the frost giant king.&nbsp; There have been legends and stories about reasons the dwarves don't live in the mountains is befcause the frost giants forced them out.&nbsp; The frost giants are afraid of the dwarves and dragonborn (The empire which borders them) taking them out.&nbsp; The frost giants are ruled by the one strongest about them... and they're... really fuckin strong.<br />(The question for which this task would answer (And the task would answer another question).&nbsp; She will share with each of us the knowledge that we seek.&nbsp; Should we agree to this, she will offer each of us a morsal of wisdom... if we are unsatisfied, we can withdraw.<br /><br />Buncha conversation... debate.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sahret and Isaline offer themselves to stay with her (To replace Haruhn).&nbsp; She says &quot;Both you together could be a suitable substitue... you are rather interesting.&quot;&nbsp; She is willing to expedite the journey as long as the two offered stayed... &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;To slay the king, it will take a significant effort on many of your behalves...&nbsp;&nbsp; some of those who have offered to stay may wish to do that task first then stay here&quot;.&nbsp; We can get an expedited trip for the cost of two people staying here. &nbsp;<br /><br />The place of power that some seek was mentioned... <br /><br />6 of us have pledged to kill the frost giant.&nbsp; The other 6 must still determine how it is they wish to proceed.&nbsp; (The 6 who swore are Isaline, Biger, Rebin, Zahar, Ed, Joe).&nbsp; She gestures, and in her hand is a large ruby.&nbsp; She's holding it and has it in one hand.&nbsp; She sets it on the arm of her throne..&nbsp; she gestures again, pulls out a dagger, bloodies ont he stone. &nbsp;<br /><br />We 6 swear:&nbsp; (Repeating after her).&nbsp; &quot;I do hereby swear by Tiamat to bring the corpse of the frost giant king to the priestess of the dark.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />She has offered to share information in good faith since we've sworn<br /><br />To Arwel:&nbsp; &quot;If you wish to save your city, seek the strength of the mountain.&quot;<br /><br />To:&nbsp; Zahar: &quot;Zahar... if you wish to reconcile your nature, then... 'he will come with me' (Said by a white figure, dressed in white clothes with a symbol of the sun....&nbsp; gives a kind, benevolent aura.&nbsp; He looks like an old man, with a long white beard, flowing robes.... ) 'There is a task that must be performed and you have been chosen to perform it.&nbsp; If Emperor dardenos is assassintated, there will be war... you must prevent it..&nbsp; Come with me...' Zahar comes...&nbsp; The man in white will wait while Zahar completes his oath .&nbsp; The Priestess of the dark was like &quot;Hey!&nbsp; He swore an oath &quot; (The being in white was Pelor), and the man in white (Pelor) says that Zahar should fulfill the sworn oath first... but try and be quick about it.<br /><br />Sahret looks very uncomfortable.&nbsp; And&nbsp; feels that Pelor is kinda encroaching,. she seems uncomfortable.<br /><br />Isaline: &quot;If you wish to secure your home, you must vanquish enemies both within and without.&quot;<br /><br />Reban:&nbsp; &quot;If you wish to meet your father, return to the lands of your ancestors, and seek the one who has bested him in battle.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Gwen:&nbsp; &quot;If you wish the truth of your ancestors magic, seek an unkown land&quot;. <br /><br />Joe: &quot;If you wish to free your soul You must break the chains&quot; The priestess seems annoyed when she tells his fortune<br /><br />Biger: &quot;If you wish to save the world, speak to the effigy.&quot;&nbsp; Wrin says... &quot;You will have success in your endeaveor, your lucky numbers are 7 and 1.&quot;<br /><br />Kith: (Kith says &quot;You would bind one of the fey with your magic?&nbsp; [[Kith seems to take such a binding as a great insult]], but she asks what she asks. &quot;If you wish to know the face of your enemy, return to the land of your people.&quot;<br /><br />Sahret:&nbsp; &quot;Sahret (Says surname)... one of them, anyway... if you wish to escape your eidolon, you must escape your father's grasp.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Title drop, session 5!)<br /><br />Simone: &quot;You wander where you will and have as many ends as their are paths...&quot;&nbsp; Kinda shrugs.<br /><br />Ed: &quot;If you wish to achieve your purpose, finish what your start.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Haruhn: She looks at him, looks amused and annoyed &quot;Where you walk, destiny follows, I have nothing to say to you,... unless you reconsder of course.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;And now I ask the remainder of the bargain... give me the sword and I will answer the remainder of the questions.&quot;&nbsp; Pelor says &quot;it pains me to say it, but what she says is liekly as true as can be.&quot; (About this actually being the best place for it right now).&nbsp; She gets a gloaty face.<br /><br />Arwel handed over the sword, because we trust Pelor.<br /><br />&quot;Thank you for such a mutually successful exchange&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Some of you seek a place of power...&nbsp;&nbsp; I can give you directions, despite what you may have thought, since others of you have so graciously offered their services.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was once her home, but it is deep in the wilds... those of you who seek it, it is a death sentence.&nbsp; But I suspect you MAY have a chance...&nbsp; You should make your way to terminus.&nbsp; As long as you follow the river into the wilds, you will find hte place.&nbsp; To seek this place IS to seek death.&nbsp; If you manage to find this place and map it, then I would like the map [To ed].&quot;<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Kith asked Pelor... &quot;What happened to my mistress...&quot;&nbsp; And Pelor looked sad and turned away.<br /><br /><br />Joe asks the priestess:&nbsp; &quot;I wish to know where I might find Jennifer from my village. [the girl that he last saw before the village disappeared]&nbsp; I would seek asnwers from her.&nbsp; &quot;She is not on this plane.&nbsp; I do not know, I'm sorry.&quot;&nbsp; It seems wierd she would apologize.<br /><br />Isaline and Joe speak about the village of humans.<br /><br />Kith asks the priestess of his master.&nbsp; The priestess rolls her eyes back and says in a voice unlike her normal on.&nbsp; &quot;Slain, long ago, for her sins.&quot; and then in her normal voice 'did that answer your question?'&nbsp; &quot;(Something said here that I missed)&nbsp; such is the nature of prophecy.&quot;&nbsp; Kith suspects she spoke an answer from a great source. &nbsp;<br /><br />Joe requests another question since she couldn't answer the first. &nbsp;<br />Sahret:&nbsp; &quot;They come in categories... what do you know about it.'&nbsp; 'The self destructive motives of mortals are (Can't remember the adjective... humorous?)'. &nbsp;<br /><br />Sahret was offering to teach the Priestess how to extract the heart of a nexus in return for aid against the frost giants and for knowledge about how to stop his withering Problem.&nbsp; Biger urged him not to do this, asked him to consult the other geomancers...&nbsp; (Since it was kind of like writing her a blank check for a bank account and all you know about the bank account is that it's got at least 8 or so digits in savings). Eventually Sahret went to 'Sleep on it.'&nbsp; (He was then convinced by the Priestess that he should teach her, so he did.)<br /><br />Ed worships the goddess of civilization Erathis.&nbsp; Ed Seems to not really like gnomes, but has nothing against Garl Glittergold. &nbsp;<br /><br />Chatted with Pelor.&nbsp; Asked him... He knows what the crank does, won't tell us.&nbsp; (Remember, he's also THE god of time.)&nbsp; About the Bahamut/Moradin Split:&nbsp; They simply have a different opinion about the best way to deal with 'the problem'. &nbsp;<br /><br />(Also, during this whole meeting/talkfest, Simone and Kith were going to turn the crank, but didn't, at Pelor's request.&nbsp; He offered them something in return for not turning the crank right now.)<br /><br />We eventually turn in and rest.&nbsp; The priestess is here as well and she eats with us.&nbsp; Pelor is still in the corner.&nbsp; Priestess:&nbsp; &quot;In honor of our agreements, I will aid in the slaying of the frost giant.&nbsp; To those pursuing their own ends, I will trnasport you where you wish top go.&nbsp; First, those who have agreed to serve me,&nbsp; Only Fire can harm the frost giant...&nbsp; Strongly magical fire, which is usually beyond the range of mortals.&nbsp; Mundane rune magic is of no use.&nbsp; I will transport you to the lair of the priestess of the red.&nbsp; You must convince her to let you go and secure her help in the slaying of the frost giant.&nbsp; She posesses a weapon capable of doing killing the king.&nbsp; Without it, we are doomed.&nbsp; There are other priestesses (There are 5.&nbsp; Red, black, blue green white... one per head of tiamat... they're the high priestesses/priests [Black and red are the two priestesses, others are male.)&nbsp; This is not the priestess of black's true form.&nbsp; Priestess of Black says &quot;Narelfiel will want something in turn. I ask only that you not mention my involvement in this.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;If you go to terminus, there will be an ally waiting for you.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have promised each of you a token of my esteem to aid you.&quot;&nbsp; She will give each of us a piece of gear.&nbsp; Anyone who wants to choose their own gear (Up to 20kgp).&nbsp;&nbsp; (Those killing the Frost giant are Red room now).&nbsp; She will teleport us.&nbsp; As in, she personally gathers us and transports us (Using several jumps, first teh group to the frost giants then the other group). &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Mordollwen, the Priestess of the Black, spoke brief words about each person, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Arwel</strong><strong> Enid Cai Eurwen</strong> - &quot;If you wish to save your city, seek the strength of the mountain.&quot;</li><li><strong>Biger OPece</strong> - &quot;If you wish to save the world, speak to the effigy.&quot; And Wrin says: &quot;You will have success in your endeavors. Your lucky numbers are 7 and 1.&quot;</li><li><strong>Eidylol Pes, Beta</strong> - &quot;If you wish achieve your purpose, finish what you started.&quot;</li><li><strong>Gwenvyth Trieleffyn Tal'Arabep</strong> - &quot;If you wish the truth of your ancestors' magic, seek an unknown land.&quot;</li><li><strong>Haroun</strong> - &quot;Where you walk, destiny follows. I have nothing to say to you.&quot;</li><li><strong> Isaline de Celapelai</strong> - &quot;If you wish to secure your home, you must vanquish enemies both within and without.&quot;</li><li><strong>Joseph Vernor</strong> - &quot;If you wish to free your soul, then you must break the chains.&quot;</li><li><strong>Kithlandil</strong> - &quot;If you wish to know the face of your enemy, return to the lands of your people.&quot;</li><li><strong>Rebin&nbsp;&quot;Bombast&quot;&nbsp;Noroelwa</strong> - &quot;If you wish to meet your father, return to the lands of your ancestors and seek the one who has ever bested him in battle.&quot;</li><li><strong>Sahrit Doubain</strong> - &quot;If you wish to be free of your eidolon, you must escape your father's grasp.&quot;</li><li><strong>Simone Hadarai</strong> - &quot;You wander where you will, and have as many ends as there are paths.&quot;</li><li><strong>Za'har</strong> - &quot;If you wish to reconcile your nature&mdash;&quot;</li></ul><p>Those who agreed to assist Mordollwen swore an Oath on Tiamat: &quot;We will slay the Frost Giant King and deliver his body to the Priestess of the Black forthwith.&quot;</p><p>The next morning, Lady Mordollwen told them:&nbsp;&quot;I will transport you to the lair of the Priestess of the Red. You must convince her to let you go, and secure her help in killing the Frost Giant King. She possesses a weapon capable of doing this, without which you are surely doomed. Narylfiel will want something of great value in return&mdash;appeasing her is your responsibility. My only requirement is that you are not to mention my involvement in any of this.&quot;</p>
