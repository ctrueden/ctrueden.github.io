      <p>Failure. Sorrow. Fury.</p><p>The Emperor lies dead. Felled by an assassin wielding that cursed sword. I have failed to uphold my duty to the empire as a citizen, I have failed the Emperor as one of his guard, I have failed the Gods as their agent. Deep runs my dispair.</p><p>And yet, it seems this is not enough. In the midst of this madness, a horde force seeks to sweep through this city, the city which lies under the final aegis of the Emperor. They will steal, and kill, and burn. And to this I say no.</p><p>All the people of this city, those who welcomed us, those who rejected us, those who sat in ignorance and indifference, all of them are deserving of the protection the empire offers. I am Norn Za'har, and today I shall be this fist of the Emperor. Those who would take from the meek shall be brought low by the fist of hell, the flames of righteousness fueled by the sweat of my labors, the blood of my wounds, the tears of my anguish. The fate of the Emperor will not be shared by his people.</p>
