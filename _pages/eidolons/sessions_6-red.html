      <p>Well the frost giant king has been slain and with an astounding lack of casualties on our part.&nbsp; It was a brutal battle that somehow only I escaped from unharmed.&nbsp; Though I hate to say it, we owe the Priestess of the Red greatly for her lending us the wand.&nbsp; I just wonder what the dragon back in the swamp will say about receiving only the giant's body.&nbsp; Now we are completely within our oaths (note the plural) to give the Dwarven Crown to the Red and the body to the Black.&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly doubt that the Black will be pleased with the results, but there is nothing we can do now.</p><p>My party members fought with great valor and regardless of their affiliation should be counted as heroes of the Empire.&nbsp; Truly I cannot express how honored I am to fight alongside with such people.&nbsp; The revelation of the dwarf being&nbsp;Rebin's father is odd and I am sure there is much to be heard on the subject.&nbsp; Being magically frozen into a glacier in the middle of this mountain range is quite odd to say the least.</p>

      <p><br /><br />10/2/09<br />Session 6<br /><br />Party: Isaline, Biger, Joeseph, Zahar, Ed, Reban<br /><br />We are teleported 3 times... (Because it's that far away). (After I buff everyone)<br /><br />&quot;If there is nothing else, you may contact me when you are done&quot; and she indicates the direction of the priestess of the red.&nbsp; It's about 40 degrees, the terrain is stable. &nbsp;<br /><br />After about 10 minutes or so, we find something that looks like a cave opening except its like 25 ft high and looks more like a draconic cave. &nbsp;<br /><br />A woman approaching looks like a typical fire genasi...&nbsp;&nbsp; reddish colored... &quot;Why have you sought me up here?&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />We tell her that we're here to kill the frost giant king and were brought to her doorstep by divinations. &nbsp;<br /><br />She wonders what she'd get from our help (And comments that the divinations were powerful indeed).&nbsp; Apparently the removal of the giants isn't enough.<br /><br />&quot;There is an inconvenience that I must deal with soon...&nbsp; As you are undoubtadly well aware, the mountains are under the claim of the empire.&nbsp; And in exchange for not being bothered by its citizens, they have occasionally asked her assitance in trivial matters... of late there are more trivial matters that need to be taken care of... and my expectation is that in a month or so, someone would bother me about them... if you aid me in these, <br /><br />One of many things that the empire has had to compromise on is that the oracle of tiamat is there.&nbsp; They ask her how to conduct dealings in ways best for the empire. This is probably that person. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Their task comes late this year... I can only assume that it is the murder of the emperor that is responsible for this... so its likely that any task they ask will revolve around this.&nbsp; Regardless of the triviality of the task, I will help you&quot;&nbsp; She says.<br /><br />'Very well.&nbsp; I suppose there won't be any need for an oath, as you two (Isaline and Zahar) have an interest as well.'<br /><br />'The frost giants have, over time removed the dwarves from the mountains... and the frost giant king wears the crown of the former dwarf king.&nbsp; He is nigh invulnerable.&nbsp; You could, perhaps, with great difficulty, convince him to remove it.&nbsp; It so happens that my kind are not restricted to mortal magic...&nbsp; I would be willing to lend you an item of some small power, but I would like something in exchange...&nbsp; I would like the crown in exchange. ' <br /><br />&quot;We will return the wand of Narylfiel in perfect condition after our task is complete, we will deliver the frost giant king's crown at the same time.&quot; (Remember, this is a best effort thing... &quot;Do everything in your power to&quot; is implied).&nbsp; She makes us swear an oath over Tiamat. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;I will return shortly.&quot;&nbsp; She returns shortly and has a wand with a ruby tip.&nbsp; &quot;Anyone can use this if they possess the command word 'This will produce fire that the crown cannot resist'&nbsp; (In draconic, the command word:&nbsp; Destruction from the sky).&nbsp; &quot;I would not stand too close..&quot;&nbsp; We will probably need to strike him multiple times.&nbsp; It's REALLY powerful... and She's REALLY evil... &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;That is an interesting quesiton and... it is not consistent&quot; (Regarding the wand's area of effect)<br /><br />We teleport to a fur tent... there is a table of food.&nbsp; There are 10 frost giants plus the king.&nbsp; The king is about 6 ft taller than the rest of them, but bigger, and wearing an ornate crown and&nbsp; everything else conflicts.&nbsp; The roof is supported by wood with an angled top.&nbsp; It's a big Yurt, but not round&nbsp; The king notices something is a bit off, everyone else is surprised. &nbsp;<br /><br />Ed starts to hum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wand is used...<br /><br />The Frost Giant King and the others nearby are blasted by the wand...It was a bit Blast of fire descending form the sky.&nbsp; The king though was not flatfooted and is looking like SHEEEEIIIIT... &nbsp;<br /><br />The stone table is destroyed.&nbsp; It doesn't set stuff on fire, it just disintigrates it. &nbsp;<br /><br />I Used smite evil and dropped a Frost giant.&nbsp; King is pissed.&nbsp; He's raising the alarm.&nbsp; He threw the hammer.&nbsp; It's a thundering shocking returning throwing hammer of some sort.&nbsp; The King is Still standing after a second (It did 144 damage or so..&nbsp; If you have improved evasion, reflex save for half!)<br /><br />Ed does sonic damage once he activates himself. &nbsp;<br /><br />Note;&nbsp; YOU CANNOT TAUNTAUN THE FROST GIANT..&nbsp; Also, you probably shouldn't overclock the artificat...<br /><br />There is a figure entombed in the ice.&nbsp; It's a dwarf... trapped in the ice.<br /><br />The frost giant king grabs me as a hostage.&nbsp; We all quickly agree to blast him one more time anyway (Total of 4 blasts?).&nbsp; I am conscious by 4 HP afterward...&nbsp; The bardic music Bravely continues! I put myself, Wrin, and the Giant king Into the portable hole for someone to pick up and take away. &nbsp;<br /><br />Isaline flies around wiht the wand calling down the orbital laser of Holy shit.&nbsp; I hold onto the crown. &nbsp;<br /><br />I'm holding onto the crown momentarily (Given to Joe's handy haversack).&nbsp; The hammer is being held by Reban.&nbsp; The hammer is being used to chip the ice to get the Dwarf out.&nbsp; (Normal weapons did nothing to the ice).&nbsp; The dwarf is in heavily enchanted magic.&nbsp; Clearly not done by the chieftain of the frost giants.&nbsp; No magical goods apart from the artifacts. &nbsp;<br /><br />After a while we break through a section of the ice and break out the Dwarf. &nbsp;<br />(Joe got a 14 HD frost giant skeleton).&nbsp; He looks to Reban and says &quot;My son...&quot;<br /><br />(The spell was a meteor swarm)<br /><br />(Frost giant king had: 28HD giant 440 HP, and over 144.&nbsp; He was a divine oracle, and could not be surprised... he was a shaman.&nbsp; )<br />&nbsp;</p>

      <p>(The entry on this session will not be posted to these notes, as combat took up so much of the session that logically there was no time for Joesph to sit and write in his journal.&nbsp; Other strange events may eclipse the giant killing, so I am going to wait until the days events have finished.&nbsp; However I will post general thoughts my character has on the session.&nbsp; This is NOT meant to be a journal entry)</p><p>Joesph is a little...excited by how well the battle went.&nbsp; This was easily one of the most dangerous fights he's been in, and using a magic item as powerful as the wand is an experience that will likely affect his views of magic from now on.&nbsp; The Skeletal Frost Giant is a welcome addition to Joesphs undead under his control, but its unlikely he will have full control over it for some time. (it is 14HD, and Joesph can only control undead at or below his current HD(10).)&nbsp; But even still, how often does a person get to throw out a Large Skeletal Frost Giant?&nbsp; While it'll eat up a large space in his HD slots, its definitly worth it.&nbsp; Now he will be more likely to use the Pseudonatural Zombie Orc, as he's got something more awesome in the wings.&nbsp; That and it will free up some room for other awesome things.</p><p>Interesting how there was a dwarf in the ice, Joesph is curious as to why he was imprisoned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
