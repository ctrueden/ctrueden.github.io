      <p>To know what is real and what is not is necessary to understand, regardless of the subject. And yet, within our world, the past is often a matter of conjecture. How does one prepare, knowing that what was may be as uncertain as what shall be?</p><p>We find ourselves in Arx, courtesy of the enigmatic man known as Vance. Something strikes me as familiar about that name, though it is likely a trick of my growing restlessness. There is a clear and present problem, however. The council of Arx currently deliberates over the fate of their nexus, more specifically whether or not to invert it.</p><p>In my past, and perhaps this world's future, the inversion of the Terminus nexus led to disaster. And yet, I do not know quite how to impart this knowledge onto the council. If they can scarcely agree on the history of past events, how can I expect them to believe in the validity of predictions of their future?</p><p>The revelation of Admatha's true nature has only made things worse. Apparantly there is a history between her and the goblin magess, but now the ladies Noroelwa and Tal'Arabep know of my companions' involvement in the lineship incident. This will certainly lead to further difficulty.</p>

      <p>Thoughts (and highlights)<br /><br />-----------------------------<br /><br />- Arx. Why are we here again? Oh yeah, because that halfling had another vision. Something about the nexus being inverted and demons pouring out. Honestly though; Why are we blindly assuming those visions are even right? They could be hallucinations for all we know. Well... whatever. Turns out we have an audience with Delphian council members. I hold out hope, maybe out of desperation, that politicking might be fun to watch. Boy was I right!<br /><br />- Seeing the look on that Noroelwa woman's face at the council meeting when she saw that Admatha was inhabiting the body of her son. It was great. No, really. I had to try really hard to hold back laughter.<br /><br />- Alright, so get this. There was an orc. With a monocle. Yeah, that's exactly what my reaction was. I don't even know any more.<br /><br />- The deva and I had a fireside chat with that Noroelwa woman afterwards, along with the Tal-Ara.. Tal-Are... eh, fuck it, some drow gal. The horde never really taught me to read that well anyway, and the Drow seem to have a fetish for tongue-twister names. Probably their way of remaining smug even though they live mostly underground. So it turns out the drow is in favor of inverting the nexus. And why not? Inverted. Not inverted. They all run out of power eventually, right? Plus, I could use a refresh. Monocle Orc shows up and tells the ladies that I was part of the fight at the Lineship that did their son and daughter in. Thank you, Monocle Orc! There's a reason I didn't bother to remember your name after you introduced yourself. Can you guess why?! So I fessed up because I figure I was only indirectly involved, they can only be so angry. But it's okay! I smoothed it over by explaining how the flow basically makes nothing matter because we're dealing with alternate realities running alongside each other anyhow. Za'har knows that Rebin and Gwenvyth are still alive. I mean, Za'har thought I was dead too, so there you go, eh?<br /><br />- More politicking at the council the next day. Some yelling happens. Deadlocked on whether or not to invert the nexus. Which is a shame. Part of me wanted to see things escalate.<br /><br /><br />Goals<br /><br />------------<br /><br />- Research my pact some more. Vance gave me valuable info on how I might escape it. But knowing devils and their contracts, there's probably some ridiculous loophole somewhere. Of course, this means I have to find someplace that has books. I'll be honest. I have no idea where to start. But it's fine! I'm not embarassed. The way I see it, I'm SO smart, that it's actually charming for me to not know basic things sometimes. *grin*<br /><br />- Question these visions that our geomancer keeps getting. I think Za'har will back me up on this one.<br /><br />- Find Vance's son? I'm kind of relieved Vance is gone. He was creepy. And this is coming from me - a warlock.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
