      <p><br />10/16/2009<br />Session 7<br /><br />From under the dwarf's skin we can see little bits of light coming out of him.&nbsp; He reaches a hand toward Ryan's head. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;The task of my salvation now falls to you&quot; We heard the dwarf say.&nbsp; (And he sent Reban a vision of a lake).&nbsp; He transforms into a light and goes to Rebans heart and disappears into the locket that Reban is carrying... then the dwarf is gone?<br /><br />&quot;What was that about&quot; (Biger).<br /><br />&quot;I'm pretty sure that was my dad&quot; (Reban).&nbsp; &quot;I think it wasn't tangibly him...&quot; [Reban can still sense that his father is alive... in the direction north by northeast.] (Into the frozen wastes).&nbsp; That may have been either his spirit or just another version of him.&nbsp; Reban's pretture sure only real important thing is that there is animportant reason to go and get him.&nbsp; Reban seemes stunned.&nbsp; &quot;That was pretty emotionally intense... i'm gonna need a minute...&nbsp;&nbsp; He showed me a lake... and... I dunno... he's not... just here...&nbsp; the rest of him is.. if the vision he showed me is correct, the rest of him is frozen deep in a lake. He indicates that he is supposed to go NNE...&nbsp; he'd like our help...&nbsp; It's important to him. &nbsp;<br /><br />We owe the red Dragon a favor on top of returning the crown of win to her. &nbsp;<br /><br />The only place where large lakes freeze is in the frozen wood.<br /><br />We return to the lair of the priestess of the Red. <br /><br />We return, and the priestess of the red is speaking with a warforged.&nbsp; Shows signs of wear.&nbsp; Belt of decent looking livery.&nbsp; A smoking pipe in one hand.&nbsp; Some nifty parchment thing with a seal on it.&nbsp; The priestess says &quot;One moment, I see you are back&quot;.&nbsp; He's probably the imperial messenger. &nbsp;<br /><br />She puts the wand away.&nbsp; The priestess puts the crown of uber (Which resizes on her head and the wand.&nbsp; And she kinda smiles... &quot;As for the favor that was going to be determined... it would seem that the empire has sent a request of me and I will send these in my stead.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />The priestess of the red seems to have confidence that we will do this task.&nbsp; If we accomplish the task that the empire requests, our task will be done.&nbsp; The priestess of the red leaves us alone.<br /><br />We talk with the Warforged (Who introduces himself as Tuan hun-ger)<br /><br />2 days of phantom steed ride takes us to Alexandria. (Tuan's doesn't ever vanish). &nbsp;<br /><br />I ask how a warforged works for the empire.&nbsp; Tuan answers his city was captured...&nbsp; he cleans himself by like ventilating and such...&nbsp;&nbsp; draining fluiods from his knees and such.&nbsp; He joined the empire became a citizen and hasn't needed to recharge since.<br /><br />I've never seen this place...&nbsp; A magnificent city... primarily dwarven make, stone, mostly.&nbsp; It has been built partially for aesthetics, not just for <br /><br />We go inside the castle and enter the throne room.&nbsp; There are a pair of people ehre... there are members of the emperors personal guard.&nbsp; We see a dwarf speaking with something that looks to be impossible.&nbsp; It has a spectral form.&nbsp; It's unheard of.&nbsp; It looks undead beyond all doubt.&nbsp; It is also the emperor.&nbsp; He is NOT evil.&nbsp; He is not sitting in the chair.&nbsp; The dwarf speaking to him turns and says &quot;Moradin's will be served.&quot;<br /><br />Next to the emperor Is a guy who drops invisibility once the dwarf is gone.&nbsp; This guy looks human, but with fiendish traits.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has horns and a slightly reddish tinge to his skin (An old school tiefling look), wearing nice clothes but which are not purely imperial fashion.&nbsp; And he sys to the emperor &quot;My people will declare war.&nbsp; Does this not disturb you?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;This is Bahamuts will *Said sadly*.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;We feel a very small quake, and the guy reaches out and he vanishes in a flash of black and red.&quot;<br /><br />The emperor sighs and says &quot;I have no doubt.&quot;<br /><br />We tell the king that the priestess of the red dlegated thigns to us.<br />&quot;Then we will do what we can with what we have...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;As you can tel, things have grown tumultuous in the empire.&nbsp; It will be important to make there be a living emperor again... there needs to be a line.&nbsp; We need to know who can be trusted and who cannot...&nbsp;&nbsp; My death could not be accomplished without help from inside the empire.&nbsp; I trust you two, and the outside perspective could help.&quot;<br /><br />Isaline shows him a letter... Emperr says&quot;The Marquee has been behaving strangely for sometime.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I have no reason to question the accuracy of my teacher, but I cannot speak for the marquee himself.&quot; (Isaline)<br /><br />&quot;You have experienced the flow... it was clear, since I do not recognize you.&nbsp; The Marquis I speak of is...&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And he is not to be trusted&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;It is an unfortunate thing tat I do not have the evidence to act, but its good to know to.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If the succession is not performed in the proper way, I forsee war... against everyone. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Who was the individual?&quot;&nbsp; (Joe)<br /><br />&quot;He is the victim of a curse.&nbsp;&nbsp; He and those like him have surrendered what they once were for fiendish power.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Before he became what he came now, was he like me?&quot; (Joe)<br /><br />&quot;Perhaps, but I don't know.&quot; Said the emperor.<br /><br />Emperor: &quot;I will gladly provide any service I may help.&quot;<br /><br />The other three names are identical to what they were before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Emperor tells us of the MArquis of Nifleheim.&nbsp; He is a Deva and one of the only dragon knights the empire has:&nbsp; He subdued a dragon and made it his mount.&nbsp; The Marquis was wounded in crippling fashion and the the dying fiend he would never again be touched by magic.&nbsp; He's a cripple but has way much of&nbsp; cred.&nbsp; He rules fairly and there was never any corruption on his part.&nbsp; Currently the people who go around and handle things in his region are his wife and seneschal (His wife is the higher of the two.) <br /><br /><br /><br />Midgard: (The north one)&nbsp; Leaf Bloodletter.&nbsp; Was the general, became the marquis, stayed the general.&nbsp; Is a berserker.&nbsp; A very unrelenting general.&nbsp; Renowned for martial skill, not political maneuvering.&nbsp; most of his advisors are militant... but he understands the need for politics, but he doesn't want to deal with it<br /><br />Valhalla: Ironheart is a knight of a warrior of skilla nd valor.&nbsp; he leads the training campaigns.&nbsp; Most warriors are trained here. The Valiant was a dragonborn who worked his way up to being a general and is a tactical genius.&nbsp; They seem honorable. &nbsp;<br /><br />Elyria is the region whose&nbsp; Marquis who way untrustworthy.&nbsp; Humans and those like them are exceptionally rare.&nbsp; It would be easy to see such among citizens of the empire. &nbsp;<br /><br />The emperor says that your people existed in the distant past but no longer.&nbsp; We are not touched by the Nexus.. which only gives more credibility to the idea that you are from a time or place where such things did not exist.&nbsp; (The Nexuses have always existed.&nbsp; So he could be from the future or another place.) &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />We ask for the emperor. &nbsp;<br /><br />Ed requests something of the emperor. &quot;It is my knowledge that the Emprei has destroyed nexuses, and I would like toknow where they were.&quot;&nbsp; The Existence of the nexuses that have been dismanteled.&nbsp; You may gain access to those records in any free time that you have. <br /><br />The emperor turns to us... &quot;The topic of nexuses has raised a quandry... as such... as you will be doing me a service.&nbsp; The emperor&nbsp; offers us the benefits of citizenship.&nbsp; (He holds out his hands, and We feel refreshed(Or recharged, in the case of Ed and I.)<br /><br /><br />He calls down the blessing of his god in draconic to bring us to the destination we need.&nbsp; We feel an upswel of divine energy which feels similar to when Rebans father disappearred. &nbsp;<br /><br />(Ed and I remain behind). &nbsp;<br /><br />In seconds, of the party arriving the priestess of the black arrives.&nbsp; The priestess of the Black is <br /><br /><br />&quot;We are looking to stop treachery within the empire.&nbsp; How many of the high lords are not to be trusted.?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; She gets a strained look and says &quot;The intentions of one are clearly disloyal...&nbsp;&nbsp; One is stupid.... but of both of the others, I sense there is something preventing them from being divined.&nbsp; One of these, we know (Because no one can touch magic).&nbsp; She has content for them.&nbsp; The one you already suspect, you know the truth.&nbsp; Midgard is unlikely, so that leaves Elyria and Valhalla.<br /><br />Joe asks about Jenna... but the same block lies over both...&nbsp; The Priestess looks pissed, because she doesn't know these things. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp; To walk the path of the fists of heaven and hell.&nbsp; Can this bring about the salvation of the world?<br /><br />The priestess of the Black says &quot;There are significant dangers to the path you folow, but should you master both trains of thought, you will find quality and purity.&quot; <br /><br />Reban.&nbsp; Reban wants to know where it is exactly. &nbsp;<br /><br />Reban asks... &quot;What al will be necessary for us... me... to do in order to release my father.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Priestess of Black looks at Reban... and glances back down at the body of the frost giant king.&nbsp; And she says.&nbsp; &quot;To Free what you know as your father, you need but to destroy the amulet you are wearing.&nbsp; But to in truth free your father, you would need to brave hell itself.&quot;&nbsp; She seems to take a particular pleasure in telling him that.&nbsp; There is some part of that information that intrigues her. &nbsp;<br /><br />Note, we Ed and I weren't there. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;Regardless of where we stand, I appreciate all of your help.&nbsp; I will bargain -fairly- with all who come here.&quot;<br /><br />We release Zahar to his Task, should he desire.&nbsp; Zahar offers to return and help as he can once he returns. &nbsp;<br /><br />The projection spell ends..<br /><br />We warforged have like 15 minutes.&nbsp; He asked his god for a favor and there was divine favor. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; &quot;What do you remember about that fateful night.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Emperor:&nbsp; &quot;I remember that we were forewarned that there was going to be an attack.&nbsp; There were others who knew of it.&nbsp; And they ttempted to seek out hte nature of the assassin.&nbsp; unfortunately, their attempts were unsuccessful.&nbsp; I do not recall teh assissin... I was caught completely off guard.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The entirity of my personal guard were present in the place down to a powerful diviner in my bedchamber (Whose fate I do not know).&nbsp; There was a significant amount of time before i recovered as this. &quot;<br /><br />&quot;She was a nomad.&nbsp; (We are given a description and I work with it.)&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />What do you know about the weapon that was used... its descrption was given to me before the assassination.&nbsp; no one could divine hte weapon and finding it proved to be a very complicated task.&nbsp; I can only assume that that is the blade which killed me.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />What the emperor knows of it... a weapon.. a crystalline blade with a face etched into the guard.&nbsp; A long blade, a nice weapon, not a typical weapon for an assassin (its the Sword).&nbsp; I'm told there were significant efforts made on the parts of many people to retrieve that weapon. &nbsp;<br /><br />The hordes, people of Delphia.&nbsp; If we had known, we'd have sent for it ourselves<br /><br />I ask about the drahonborn being incapacitated.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Unfortunately from when I was felled I don't remember anything.&nbsp; I was told there was such an incident, but i don't understand why this could possibly be the case.&quot;&nbsp; Even should hte weapon...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Shakes his head...*&nbsp; In honesty, I have no theories... &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;You have the favor of your god.&nbsp; The dragonborn that were in attendance... were they followrs of the same god...&nbsp; Could there have been some connection on a level of faith instead of race?&nbsp;&nbsp; The emperor gives a cold stop to the question.&nbsp; Thuis is some nerve that ed hit.&quot;&nbsp; He is certain beyond a doubt that it is not possible.&nbsp; He knows of no dragonborn present and not incapacitated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Were there an attack against Bahamut channeled through that, he'd have known.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The emperor turns to Ed and starts to say something...&nbsp; When Ed is quaked away.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; This is in the Empire.&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPOSSIBILITY!<br /><br />The ones who went to the priestess comes back in the middle of the quest.&nbsp; Arwel replaces Ed. &nbsp;<br /><br />Arwel:&nbsp; &quot;Tell me where you learned to SMOKE!&quot; to Tuan. &nbsp;<br /><br />This quake did not extend beyond this room...&nbsp; (The Emperor said his)<br /><br />We're all baffled. &nbsp;<br /><br />The emperor says that the emperor needs to know as much of the flow as possible so they can choose to make informed decisions.&nbsp; This was outside of such knowledge. &nbsp;<br /><br />Arwel:&nbsp; &quot;The Lord of the pit has come out of a Nexus and is offering his alleigiance...It begins with a G... &quot;&nbsp; (Grazzt).&nbsp; he's a demon prince, one of the lords of the abyss.&nbsp; He's all about tempation and betrayal...&nbsp; But he's not lawful. &nbsp;<br /><br />Emperor says :&nbsp; &quot;This is very troubling news...&nbsp; I think it very unlikely that anyone would avoid war if this were the case.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Arwel met with Grazzt personally.<br /><br />The emperor says that the cursed have given up that way of life.&nbsp; Delphia is already considering war.&nbsp; There are factions among them that see the potential advantages of leading hte fiends of hell... as has been 'promised to them'. &nbsp;<br /><br />At the city of Terminus.&nbsp; The others spoke little... but Sahreet seemed interested in how they turned the nexus negative, without care that Grazzt was there.<br /><br />Emperor was upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now its all the more urgent that we take out the traitors....&nbsp; We need to prepare our people for war. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Emperor dislikes the method to create warforged...&nbsp; The Delphaic people produced the warforged and they keep them close enough that they never listen to our words.&nbsp; Tatenda is part of the empire...&nbsp; TIts the same year.&nbsp; In Arwel's reality, Tatenda was an independent city for the whole time, and the demon prince may be from that reality. &nbsp;<br /><br />Waugrim is a traitor for sure, we tell the emperor. &nbsp;<br /><br />Eloyes was taken over by the empire..&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a large mining city which was able to withstand all their troubles, then a huge horde force invaded and the empire liberated them. &nbsp;<br /><br />The priestess of the black knows how to mess with nexuses and has the sword. &nbsp;<br /><br />regardless of who is to blame, we must move quickly to move vaugrim and investigate the other.<br /><br />More important tot he empire is making sure the leadership is intact.&nbsp; In Tuan's knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arwel's mother is fine, And Arwel is a paladin.&nbsp; Arwel writes a letter to his mother. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Demons appeared in Delphians and and the demons .&nbsp; Those who had seen it were sequestered.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />I know the abyss and the hells are different.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know they are different things.&nbsp; The hells are ruled by LE devils and The Abyss is less disciplined and more ephemeral and contains CE demons.&nbsp; The idea of a lake of ice tickles something in the back of my mind but...&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe do some more research on that.&nbsp; I remember having heard something about a lake wiht relation to the hells. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Emperor is ok equipping us with +3 shit (Weapons, armors, and +4 bracers of armor). &nbsp;<br /><br />Arwel is made into a temporary citizen like us.<br /><br />After a few minutes, tuan comes back and with some messangers.&nbsp; Within a few minutes, the dwarf we saw at first... &quot;Rori ((Beardthicket)), before you begin, you have a trifling tasks which should take no more than a day.&quot;&nbsp; Please accomplish this quickly and go about the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rori says Follow me.&nbsp; TNote that the switching weapon/armor mods is really iffy.&nbsp; Not too long after, we see a halfling woman enter.&nbsp; She takes a knee, and approaches the emperor.&nbsp; He says...<br /><br />&quot;This woman is Alana Dune, a court wizard.&nbsp; She will transport you wher eyou need to go.&nbsp; You may visit the armory at any time.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />So A +3 weapon, +3 armor, and +4 bracers of armor. &nbsp;<br /><br />The emperor says that. &nbsp;<br /><br />We are introduced to the court wizard. <br /><br />It takes about half an hour, then the dwarf comes back, and he gives Arwel an armor.&nbsp;&nbsp; She knows that this takes waaaay longer than this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rori says &quot;In the empire, you learn to improvise.&quot;&nbsp; When asked how he did it so quickly. &nbsp;<br /><br />The wizard casts the teleport.&nbsp; The emperor says that we're totally fine.&nbsp; We are teleported.&nbsp; We go to Valhalla.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />We appear and we ae standing in a reasonably large room.&nbsp; There are specific rooms for people to be teleported into to avoid teleportation into people.&nbsp; We are immediately led out to avoid being telefragged. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;As part of the emperor's personal guard, I'm not allowed to arrest anyone&nbsp;&nbsp; So if you get in trouble, you might be in trouble....&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Valhalla is a city primarily built with heavy stonework.&nbsp; it is first the base where the army is trained and most of the imperial forces are trained in Valhalla.&nbsp; So there are imperial solderis EVERYWHERE..&nbsp;&nbsp; patrols every block.&nbsp; (I do keep my mithril chain shirt +1 because this stuff has imperial Livery.) &nbsp;<br /><br />There are some civilians here but they're here to provide services and such to the military.&nbsp; There is an Arena.&nbsp; Most of the people here are carrying standard equipment for soldiers and a cold iron dagger on their belts.&nbsp; Valhalla is IN enemy territory.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like 2 weeks into the Feywood.&nbsp; The most fortified structure in the city is Marquis Ironhearts palace.&nbsp; Secondmost fortified is the generals manshion which is across the way.&nbsp; both are very defendable structures which are sealed in so flying creatures can't easily access the inside area. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Palisades have been treated with cold iron and the like...&nbsp; its fortified against fey. &nbsp;<br /><br />Get to the central structure and it looks familiar to Isaline, so yay.&nbsp; And someone who is dressed in the livery of the Marquis and is a dragonborn.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Lady, how may we serve?&quot; to Isaline.&nbsp; The Dragonborn nods and says &quot;If these are the words of our late emperor, then the Marquis would like to hear it.&quot;&nbsp; (Sense motive reveals that he knows the emperor is not silent.)&nbsp; We wait a bit...&nbsp; chill... The reception area has arrow slits.&nbsp; They are ready for anyone to try anything.&nbsp; About 10 minutes pass.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;My lady, the Marquis will see you immediately.&nbsp; He nods and leads us off. &nbsp;<br /><br />We are taken to the Dining hall.&nbsp; The Marquis is waiting for us, he is seated alone and there are guards in the corners.&nbsp; &quot;My Lady, please have a seat.&quot;&nbsp; he appears to be unarmed.&nbsp; He looks like a combat veteran.&nbsp; This marquis is superchivalrous knight one.&nbsp; He is a dragonborn who is capable. &nbsp;<br /><br />You must have come Quite a ways to come and see me. <br /><br />We are frank and to the point, which pleases him.&nbsp; The Wizard has stayed out. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;The fact of the matter is we have been speaking with the Emperor.&nbsp; The guards seem a ittle bit uncomfortable.&nbsp; at mention of this, and the Marquis says &quot;You have my word that nothing said here will leave this room&quot; and the guards snap to attention.<br /><br />Arwel mentions her tale, including the quake (Which the marquis is unnerved by...)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />The Delphians turned the overflowing positive nexus by inverting it. &nbsp;<br /><br />&quot;This is something new to me.&nbsp; Please explain.&quot;&nbsp; Instead of positive energy flowing from it, negative energy does...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />'The Significance of the geomatic ramifications are not under my purview.'<br /><br />Also of note is that Grazzt is there...&nbsp; The Marquis growls further... he seems taken aback when mentioned that the Delphians did this.&nbsp; Arwel mentions that the Delphians were also taken aback...<br /><br />The marquis Has experience fighting demons and seems confident. &nbsp;<br /><br />tuan acknowledges that this is true.<br /><br />&quot;There are obviously reasons that this should concern me.... but why are you here?&quot;&nbsp; We explain we're here to get an heir.<br /><br />He seems to be going along with what he says but there's an undercurrent of hostility.&nbsp; (&quot;You would dare accuse me?&quot; kind of hostility)<br /><br />It is all the more important to be certain of where everyone stands in a time as tough as this.<br /><br />&quot;I will be blunt.&nbsp; I do not wish to serve a dead emperor. I wish succession to occur quickly.&quot;&nbsp; He <br /><br />He has an undercurrent in what he says.&nbsp; he is leaving out something, but not exactly lying when he says &quot;I have not spoken with the other Marquis since the Emperor's death.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Of all the Marquis who do you most favor?&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Few things are too presumptuous for a general of the mepire, hoever it seems to me that each of the marquis have their own flaws.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish, I will give you brief my opinion of it.<br /><br />&quot;In the North.&nbsp; The Marquis bloodletter... his methods are crude... and it makes sense that he is posted where he is.&nbsp; He is not considered <br /><br />To the east is the dragon tamer.&nbsp; He would not survive as the emperor.&nbsp; he is a deva and has no heir, which would prevent him from having an heir.&nbsp; Second, he is a cripple, so he wouldn't have the force of presence to lead the people.&nbsp; He leads the east through intermediaries, something that a skilled emperor <br /><br />A lot of this Marquis contempt comes from this guy was a great warrior, and he fell so far...&nbsp; And this marquis is constantly reminded that no body is immune.&quot;<br /><br /><br />He scowls...&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />This guy lets out a lot of contempt.&nbsp;&nbsp; The conversation about the marquis of the west angers him legitametly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I have personally stopped 3 assassinations attempts, and I strongly suspect the source.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />To the best of my knowledge 3 of the 4 lands are ruled well enough... however, Elyria has not made any significant successes since Eloyes.&nbsp; The Marquis ther eis too busy conniving against the rest of us.&nbsp; People that I have trained personally lead their armies (The Outriders).&nbsp; The army there may be trustworthy.&nbsp; People <br /><br />This guy believes that everyone who comes through here Is loyal to the empire and he takes particular hands in it.<br /><br />The Marquis has a question<br /><br />&quot;One of the emperor saids recently came to our city.&nbsp; For a brief period of time, there was a quake.&nbsp; At the end, he dismisised the Norns that were stationed here.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The norns are the guardians of the Nexus)&nbsp; These Norn were told that their services were no longer required.&nbsp; He was a dwarven man.&nbsp; The dwarf from the Emperors chamber (rori) said this.&nbsp; This is one of the guys who is allowed nexuses.&nbsp; This nexus was fairly recently captured.... it normally takes centuries to destroy a Nexus.&nbsp; That man has been in the employ of the emperor For many centuries.&nbsp; As the norn will tell us, It is not allowed to see the Nexuses unless you're one of the designated people. &nbsp;<br /><br />His contempt for necromancy is just so overwhelming that any further knowledge is obscured.&nbsp;&nbsp; Undead bad, mkay?<br /><br />With the Norn Gone, soldiers were sent, and the Nexus does not Exist any longer.&nbsp; It would be difficult but not impossible to prevent others to find out the truth. &nbsp;<br /><br />We give some advice to strengthen attack.<br /><br />The troops that attacked Eloyes werelike a bunch of people fused in.&nbsp; They were lead through a nexus from Arx. &nbsp;<br /><br />It might be connected with the heart of the nexuses. &nbsp;<br /><br />We stay for the remainder of dinner.&nbsp; He says &quot;We did with Irritation on an almost daily basis.&nbsp; If it gets too much worse, we may have to equip the men with nets.&quot;&nbsp; Occasionally up to a dozen come at this fort...&nbsp; so now its more like a nand of them work together to cause mischief.&nbsp; This place has been fortified against the fey....<br /><br />Zahar suggests we talk to his master. &nbsp;<br /><br />This Marquis believes what he has said, and Has been there himself (With regards to the nexus).<br /><br />The empire, when they take a new city:&nbsp; They offer imperial citizenship to anyone who is currently there.&nbsp;&nbsp; People have 1 month to accept the offer or evacuate.&nbsp; It seems like the benefits of imperial citizenship have no real time or distance limitations. &nbsp;<br /><br />We are given rooms in the nobles section of the fortress.&nbsp; There is a brief scuffle of Fey attack, and they run out.&nbsp; The military respone is quick and efficient.&nbsp; (True seeing saw nothing strange there.)<br /><br />Zahar remind us that if the crippled deva doesn't look like a deva, he must be destroyed...&nbsp; My kind wear corruption on their sleeve...&nbsp; Thos eof my people who walked the dark path are corrupted in form.&nbsp; THey are fairly dark legends.&nbsp; Rakshasa are what these corrupted are known as.&nbsp; They are wickedly powerful and firmly evil.. and also exceedingly rare.&nbsp; There is no fate greater feared among the Devas than to fall to that fate.&nbsp; A blessed crossbow bolt is said to kill them. &nbsp;<br /><br />Zahar has lived many lives, personally.&nbsp;&nbsp; One who has turned to rakshasa...&nbsp; Well... who knows what happens when they're killed.&nbsp; Zahar. Deva respawn at a temple of their god.&nbsp; If magic magic cannot touch him, he may not be touched by magic, he may be 'dead' to the Devas.&nbsp; This may have broken his mind.&nbsp; To Deva, the cycle is the entirety of their existence.&nbsp; Zahar only remembers his previous lives vaguely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe says that sounds familiar to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is one person who was real from what happened before he ended up here.&nbsp; That was jennifer.... His parents, friends, etc... all felt and still feel as if they were a story told to him rather than truly real.&nbsp; He feels little connection to that previous life beyond that one woman.&nbsp; Haruhn himself stated that she is not technially of this world. &nbsp;<br /><br />We meet up with Alana.&nbsp; We successfully appear in another teleportation chamber (In Nifelheim).<br /><br />It's really cold here.&nbsp; The buildings are made of wood.&nbsp; Some are then futher covered with furs etc.&nbsp; It's 15ish fahreignheit. &nbsp;<br /><br />There is a single stone builing:&nbsp; The Marquis' palace...&nbsp; Most stone buildings don't last well here.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />There is a normal distribution of evil here.&nbsp; Here people are more evil than a typical city, and in the other city there was almost no evil.<br /><br />No guards here are evil. We go to the marquis' mansion.&nbsp; There is a dragonborn man here... the Seneschall.&nbsp; &quot;I will notify the Marquis at once.&quot;&nbsp; He comes back in a few minutes looking startled:&nbsp; &quot;He will see you immediately&quot;...&nbsp; He is definately surprised, but not by us... rather, by his response. &nbsp;<br /><br />We are led off and brought into a room with a bunch of thick and unusual fus along hte room.&nbsp; And we see the Marquis.&nbsp; He is seated at a desk, in his wheelchair. &nbsp;<br /><br />he looks like a Deva and unusually pale and Emaciated.&nbsp; He looks like he has been afflicted and never recovered.&nbsp; He's paying a lot of attention. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Seneschal has a few magic items but is not using illusionary.&nbsp; The Marquis nods and says &quot;For one of the Emperors own guards, I'd be glad to take some time.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is an interesting day.&nbsp; You bring a general I've never met and a Norn to me.&nbsp; Our army as always stands ready to support the empire.&quot;<br /><br />This marquis seems disturbed by the same sorts of things but doesn't respond with particularly strong emotion.&nbsp; Sense motiving himL&nbsp; He is definately disturbe dby Arwel's descriptions, but he seems to be a very introspective person.&nbsp; He is in information absorption mode. &nbsp;<br /><br />Once we finish the story... I can only imagine that this will lead to very unpleasant times for all of us.&quot;<br /><br />The Marquis:&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, my condition leaves me a poor condition to act as regent.&nbsp; Only two would be willing to cease the throne...&nbsp; (The evil one), and Marquis Ironheart might also be willing to do so, but he would have nobler intentions.&nbsp; He wants power more so that other people don't have it there.&nbsp; And The lord of the North would hate the beaurocracy, and so would give up regency probably too soon.&nbsp; The emperors personal guard may well be the best suited to the role of regent.&nbsp; that would be my personal decison (Says the marquis still).&nbsp;&nbsp; But I do not think that is not the reason that you have come to me. &nbsp;<br /><br />Isaline:&nbsp; We want to see what strange things might be going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within my region there are always strange things happening, but the creatures living in the frozen wood can always explain them. &nbsp;<br /><br />We mention the necromancers..<br /><br />&quot;It is unfortunately very possible that theyw ere staging the attack within the frozen wood, but it is not feasible to patrol the whole frozen wood... it's dangerous. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Maarquis has gone personally to visit the emperor once.&nbsp; This Marquis beleives that he would not be capable: He is telling the truth... he really has no inclination to involve himself in the war over the throne. &nbsp;<br /><br />We ask about Rori Beardthicket.&nbsp; Marquis asks what we know of him.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Marquis:&nbsp; &quot;I'm not certain how much should be spoken of *Looks at Tuan*... how much do they know about Rori beardthicket.&quot; 'Enough'.&nbsp; &quot;I have not made communication with him since the last sealing of a nexus about a year ago.&nbsp; Why do you ask.&nbsp; Sealing the nexus takes less than about a day (A la locking it up, not destroying it).&nbsp; We mention his alacrity in unmaking the nexus. &nbsp;<br /><br />marquis says &quot;We have been looking for a way to shorten the amount of time it takes to unmake a nexus.&quot; &nbsp;<br /><br />Arwel Asks:&nbsp; &quot;Are you becoming a Rakshasa?&quot; to The Marquis.&nbsp; If you truly understood what you were asking... you wouldn't need to. &nbsp;<br /><br />I ask what will happen with his reincarnation.&nbsp; he doesn't know, so he's been putting it off.<br /><br />He has his wife and his seneschel.&nbsp; ((Allen says:&nbsp; &quot;It's the wife&quot;)).The Wife is a dragonborn.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says he trusts them both implicitly. &nbsp;<br /><br />None of the military leaders I have have required anything other than minor disciplinary actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't believe any of my followers would be treasonous. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Marquis will endeavor to assist the emperor as much as possible. &nbsp;<br /><br />I recommend that you be careful.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would not surprise me if having made the visits that you've already made, you may have attracted at least one assassin already.&nbsp; The thoughts of the assassins were taken.&nbsp; They knew nothing of who sent them.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is exactly 1 region which possess enough money and deception that the assassins could have come from there.&nbsp; based on your conversation with Lord Ironheart, you probably alreayd know of the source which I speak. &nbsp;<br /><br />Is there much tension between the regions?&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord Ironheart holds for himself a particularly high place in his estimation of the regional lords.&nbsp; West one is clearly seeking regency, and Bloodletter couldn't care less about politics, so he's been infiltrated by spies form the other three marquis.&nbsp; I do not belive it would be in any of the regional lords interest to cause a civil war...&nbsp; but if someone should SEIZE regency that would be the inevitable result. &nbsp;<br /><br />marquis:&nbsp; &quot;My concern is that Delphia may not be at risk of a civil war.&nbsp; They are rather unified, unlike the empire.&quot; (Paraphrased.)&nbsp; There are many unusual things about the,.&nbsp;&nbsp; But their unusual phoneticism for the scholorly binds them...&nbsp;&nbsp; and this level of experimentation is unknown of in the empire.&nbsp; He will be happy to keep in touch if he sees something.&nbsp; Since your arrival, the city of Terminus has in fact already had its nexus inverted.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This guy knows WAY too much says sense motive..&nbsp; It's been what... maybe a few hours?)&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether that means anything about demons I don't know.<br /><br />Despite their use of nexuses, they seem to be nice enough folk, says the marquis, and he also says that they tend to be appropriately cautious.&nbsp; And their efforts are respectable.&nbsp; If they are in fact in league with demons, then there will be wars.&nbsp; He seems to want to see them as an enemy, but respects them as a threat rather than as a useful ally. &nbsp;<br /><br />perhaps all the Marquis are working together to seize power??&nbsp;&nbsp; We should visit the berserker guy (He probably would never care.&nbsp;&nbsp; This marquis says &quot;The problem is that we all serve the empire in our own way.&quot;&nbsp; His wife comes in gives him a meaningful look and looks at him...&nbsp; seeing if he needed assistance with anything.&nbsp; She leaves after acknowledging the two imperials in our party. &nbsp;<br /><br />Tuan is asked by the Seneschal to wait a moment.&nbsp; (Zahar's master is important in the empire like The pope is important in Italy.)<br /><br />tuan says he needs to return to the emperor.&nbsp; We teleport to Bloodletter's place and WHOA SHIT BATTLE.&nbsp; (Zahar is NOT present after the teleportation (He has a visit with Pelor)).<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
