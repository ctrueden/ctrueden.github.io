      <p>Kith, Kith, Kith.... &nbsp;where are you now? &nbsp;If the people swapping is consistent, then you are in the empire. &nbsp;I worry for you, though I doubt there is much need. &nbsp;You have survived this long well enough. &nbsp;I have seen what you can do, though I have also seen you vulnerable, so I worry.&nbsp;</p><p>...</p><p>There are dangers all around us. &nbsp;Quakes keep shifting people around. &nbsp;We were attacked by dragons in the air, rust monsters (or so Biger called them) on the ground, surrounded by Echidnox (or so Wrin identified them) and lead to their village. &nbsp;On our leisurely, friendly walk there, we were chased by something.. &nbsp;well, something colossally huge and terrifying!&nbsp;</p><p>Even with all of that, I&nbsp;still feel safer here than I would back in the &quot;known&quot; world. &nbsp;Graz'zt, despite being a satyr (or maybe because of), is quite the statesman. &nbsp;Apparently, he talked the technoprophets into war with the Empire (with the help of his minions). &nbsp;According to Ed, no one stopped to ask what Graz'zt got out of the deal. &nbsp;They probably assumed he was their servant, when the roles are really reversed. &nbsp;Then when Biger rejoined us, he confirmed that demons were attacking the empire. &nbsp;Yeah, glad I'm not there....</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have seen it, seen the tower that I'm looking for. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the airship gave out before we could get too close. &nbsp;In the end, we managed to get it up and running again, and sent the engineer back the way we came.</p><p>&nbsp;The world itself seems to want to keep us away. &nbsp;I doubt it's us specifically, but everyone. &nbsp;Even the Echidnox don't want us to proceed.&nbsp; They are taking us to their village so that their chief can dissuade us. &nbsp;I don't see that happening, but I am curious about what he has to say. &nbsp;This just makes me more curious about what's in that tower and what it's history is. &nbsp;With all this resistance, I wonder if any of these grievous sins that I'm going to commit will happen here.&nbsp;</p><p>How can something out here have such an impact on the rest of the world? &nbsp;I can't help but think about what Haroun was saying about the gods, that they are merely reflections of the true power of prophesy. &nbsp;Now, I'm not a big fan of the gods. &nbsp;Some of them enabled the stifling empire to exist as it does. &nbsp;Pelor told me that I was going to do horrible things, but did nothing to stop it. &nbsp;But I don't know that prophesy is the best name for this power. &nbsp;Maybe this power lives out here. &nbsp;If it really is the power of prophesy, I don't know that I really want much to do with it. &nbsp;</p><p>Sure, I was lead here by a prophesy, but I have to wonder if I would be here without it. &nbsp;I doubt I would know Kith, or have heard his tales if I didn't try to befriend him to aid in this quest. &nbsp;But there are others looking for this spot as well (including that black priestess). &nbsp;Looking back, I think I would have ended up out here either way. &nbsp;It's not like I haven't ended up in other places unknown. &nbsp;</p><p>The black priestess said that&nbsp;&quot;you have as many ends as there are paths&quot;, but it feels inevitable that I&nbsp;would end up here. &nbsp;How could my future be so open ended, and be subject to Pelor's prophesy? &nbsp;Maybe all paths lead here? &nbsp;Can that even be true? &nbsp;</p><p>Maybe someone is manipulating things. &nbsp;These strange quakes that keep flipping people between two groups are looking less and less random all the time. &nbsp;I&nbsp;haven't been taken by one yet, though I&nbsp;suspect that it's only a matter of time. &nbsp;I haven't spent a lot of time in civilization since this has started, but I haven't heard of this kind of thing happening anywhere else. &nbsp;I&nbsp;know Sahrit is involved somehow, and I'm guessing his father is too, but that can't be all there is too it. &nbsp;Sahrit has too many gaps in his knowledge to be able to orchestrate this, or to have a purpose. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of, I don't really know the purpose of whatever could be orchestrating this. &nbsp;I hope it's all random, and there is no power or plan behind it, but I suspect that's not the case. &nbsp;I would guess that this has to do with the prophesy of the calamity. &nbsp;I hope that tower holds some answers to these questions. &nbsp;And I hope I like the answers. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'll have to let Iraja know that we've nearly made it there. &nbsp;I can only hope that she's learned a few things in the mean time that can help shed some light on this. &nbsp;I'll also have to see what she knows about this calamity.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help but think that it will be a self-fulfilling prophesy.</p><p>Damn that priestess and her worthless mutterings. &nbsp;Damn Pelor and his &quot;prophesy&quot; about my future. &nbsp;Damn Haroun and his musings on the gods. &nbsp;Here I&nbsp;am, deep in the wilds, running for my life, trying to get to where no one has been for at least quite a while, and I'm thinking about these abstract ideas, when I&nbsp;need to be living in, and enjoying the moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><br />10/30/2009<br />Session 8<br /><br />QUAKEEEEEEEEEEE<br /><br />Me, and Isaline disappear. (Move to Blue group)<br /><br />Isaline is here, as is Gwen (Who was here before).&nbsp; Simone, Ed and I.&nbsp; <br />Sitting around a campfire which has smoldered out.&nbsp; it's predawn (3rd watch).&nbsp; Simone is awakened by the quake.&nbsp; Ed asks &quot;Is that you down there&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />There's a gnomish flying machine and a nexus.&nbsp; There's very thick foliage... like a jungle... In one direction it thins out and there's a sprawling river.&nbsp; There's another gnome here dresse din dirty overalls, she says &quot;you're a small character.&quot;&nbsp; (She is catriona waddlesticks), engineer.&nbsp; 'cat' for short.<br /><br />(I feel the protection of the empire slough off of me because of my proximity to a nexus.)&nbsp; This place feels danerously saturated with spiritual energy.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're going to the place where death lives...&nbsp;&nbsp; He (Jason's character, Cameron) seems like a good idea.<br /><br />She revs up the flying machine.&nbsp; We use the boarding ramps...&nbsp; The spell feels slippery....&nbsp;&nbsp; like the place is trying to make me lose control of my magic.&nbsp; It's like trying to squish a frog into a small bottle.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We secure me to my body.&nbsp; Cat says to Ed &quot;Whoever designed you was a genius, your insides are awesome.&quot;&nbsp; he says who, Cat says it was shenanigans, because they only build war brutes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cameron's description:&nbsp; A pretty nondescript elf... average, except far too pretty...&nbsp; Totally a Bishounen. Does not detect as evil.<br /><br />This thing moves at 300 ft/round.&nbsp; There are propeller's on the fins which are flexible, and a rigid fin which has the rear propellor.&nbsp; There's a pair of Cannons on it.<br /><br />The ship should be landed near a nexus if possible.&nbsp; Don't run it more than about 8 hours a day.&nbsp; that's 2 hexes/day.&nbsp; <br /><br />They're deep in the empire.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cat asks Cameron.<br /><br />It's tough to cast, but I can work it.&nbsp; It's getting harder as we head deeper into the wilds.&nbsp; <br /><br />Something is flapping up behind us...&nbsp; Simone yells &quot;Incoming&quot;.&nbsp; <br /><br />A Fearsome huge creature with scales the color of emerals and 6 eyes line its face.&nbsp; The claws it has are like talons larger than any of us on our own.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone accelerates the ship.&nbsp; Cat unbuckles and&nbsp; and does evasive maneuvers.<br /><br />Gwen Jumps off after I cast feather fall, and Isaline is like sonovabitch and flies after her.&nbsp; Another green dragon comes flying from above, the first one rammed it from the bottom.&nbsp; The one from above tries to crush us.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />cameron gets swept off almost, but we managed to tie him to a rope and secure it to the ship.&nbsp; So he's kinda tethered.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the dragons breathes acid, then does a scorching ray.&nbsp; This dragon is not very adept at casting.&nbsp; It was scorching ray which seemed to have a low caster level, but seems like it was stronger than normal for that caster level.<br /><br />The green dragon that breathed acid is ahead of the ship readying to ram it again.&nbsp; The other one full attacks Ed and then.&nbsp; Some plants suddenly Appear from an entangle like effect but worse (Also doesn't require grass and is a sorcerer spell).&nbsp; <br /><br />The green dragon that full attacked continues gettting thrashed by Ed.&nbsp; Then Cameron moves over and stabs it in the gut.&nbsp; Its bleeding out but not dead.&nbsp; <br /><br />The green dragon off the ship gets zapped by the cannon again slightly.&nbsp; it casts shield it seems stronger than normal again.&nbsp; Cameron Gets bitten by it.&nbsp; <br /><br />I revitalize Ed, Green dragon casts a variation of true strike which takes a bonus and full attacks ed and does pretty well.&nbsp; <br /><br />'tll m th whrbts f kth lndlll s' is heard by Simone.&nbsp; (tell me where kith landell is).&nbsp; <br /><br />I smite evil the dragon and completely tear into it (1d3+30 damage total, and 3 hits because of haste... eh... heh).&nbsp; <br /><br />About a half hour Later Gwen and Isaline.&nbsp; Simone and the others help out a bunch.&nbsp; There's some movement and life in the woods, but they don't approach.&nbsp; There is evil in that direction.&nbsp; <br /><br />After about an hour, the ship is repaired.&nbsp; She starts the engine, but Simone makes the ship quiets the engine.&nbsp; Isaline comments that her horse couldn't keep up.&nbsp; <br /><br />We travel for the rest of the day.&nbsp; It is getting harder and harder to cast spells (Its not nontrivial to pass the concentration check now).&nbsp; THere are Nexuses and ley Lines all over the friggin place.&nbsp; Simone knows the way from which the power emanates.&nbsp; <br /><br />We continue to travel for 11 more days.&nbsp; Its getting harder and harder and harder to cast spells.&nbsp; We follow the river. still... and more...&nbsp;&nbsp; It goes all over the place.&nbsp; <br /><br />After 11 days we see something over the river canopy... and in the distance it looks like the river ends.&nbsp; And there's a high mountain with a narrow almost vertical spire.&nbsp; Wrin seems fidgety and charged...&nbsp; when asked why, he says &quot;Sigil!&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigil!&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />The engine sputters and dies.&nbsp; We turn around and try and coast town.&nbsp; The propellors have all died.&nbsp; but we kinda glide it down a bit.&nbsp; After 4 pulls on the ripcord it starts up again but its kinda sputtering.&nbsp; The stuff here is just too rough.<br /><br /><br />I try and scry the other party occasionally.&nbsp; (DC to concentration check is 25+ spell)<br /><br />We are subsisting off goodberries.&nbsp; <br /><br />I Use scry to view Joe still in the combat and send him the message:&nbsp; &quot;Tell them we're making progress.&quot;<br /><br />This place is very dense and thick and scary.&nbsp; Something is definately out there in the clearing... watching us.&nbsp; Some creatures begin to emerge.&nbsp; They're snuffling along the ground as though looking for food.&nbsp; They are insectile monsters..&nbsp; 2 antennae, 4 legs, mandibles.&nbsp; These creatures eat metal and turn it to rust.&nbsp; OH GOD RUST MONSTERS!&nbsp; There are a number of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone tries to enhance the engine.&nbsp; I bellow with intimidate and amplify. She seems to say that its going to start again.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're going to try and Float the thing so we can park it in the river and hope it doesn't get destroyed.&nbsp; <br /><br />I shadow grease it and shadow mount.&nbsp; pull it to the far side.&nbsp; We try and start it again.&nbsp; It does.&nbsp; I take a lock of her hair.&nbsp; I've gotten to know her to familiarly.&nbsp; I also have a bit of Ed, <br /><br /><br />Simone doesn't know much about the place of power.&nbsp; Cat tells Ed that she <br /><br />Wrin keeps being excited about sigil.<br /><br />She opens up the place by the crank... &quot;What is this?&nbsp; It's just a black box.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'You know there's two of them, right...&nbsp; there's this white box...&nbsp; She attaches a new crank.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one on the right is the black box which has a gray crank.&nbsp; The other crank is painted in a dull orange which... (I will scry for her. and message her to come pick us up.)&nbsp; <br /><br />A guy in a gold cape.&nbsp; We are now in the clearing.&nbsp; There are clearly eyes in the foliage.&nbsp; <br /><br />I lsoe control of one of the phantom steeds I'm trying to summon.&nbsp; The shadow energes do coalesce, but I lose control of what I'm making, and it forms into a huge monster.&nbsp; From the canopy, some sort of projectile shoots out and peppers the shadow creature and it dissipates... some sort of spines.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a brown thing with a sword and shield.&nbsp; it looks at me and it looks simultaneously cautious... kinda skittish... and also fierce and danger, and incredibly cute all at the same time.&nbsp; <br /><br />It says &quot;What is your purpose here&quot; in common.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone says &quot;We're here to explore.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />It says we should have left, this place is dangers, why are we here...<br /><br />Simone says we're here to explore that thing in the distance.<br /><br />It says &quot;No one comes this way and lives.&quot;&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone:&nbsp; Well, no one has... that's why we were sent out here.<br /><br />'You were sent?&nbsp; Sent by who?'<br /><br />Simone: &quot;I am following a call of my own curiosity of this place.&quot;<br /><br />'Bad place to be curious'<br /><br />&quot;That's what makes it exciting.&quot;<br />'I would tell you not to go there, but then you would.&nbsp; You must speak to the elder, the venerable... the veenrable will talk you out of it. '<br /><br /><br />&quot;Id be happy to talk with you venerable elder.&quot;&nbsp; This thing -REALLY- doesn't want us here.<br /><br /><br /><br />'I am Patrice', 'and I am Yorindo' the two say (The other coming out from the place.)<br /><br /><br /><br />'I know not what these are...' at the presence of wrin and the warforged.&nbsp; Yorindo says and seems a bit confused.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />'Echidnox, endangered species, very dangerous' says wrin.&nbsp; How does he know all about extincet and endangered species?&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 knowledge check says &quot;WTF?&quot;<br /><br /><br />I ask &quot;Why is the magic so hard to control out here&quot;.<br /><br />'Nexus energy.&nbsp; Arcadia' I haven't heard of it.&nbsp; <br /><br />'Hurry.. we must move away... you landed too close to arcadia... too close to death'&nbsp;&nbsp; in the distance there's something large...&nbsp;&nbsp; a la T rex in jurassic park.&nbsp; <br /><br />They are running at 160 ft.&nbsp; They've got some weapons.&nbsp; It knows we're here.&nbsp; trees being swept aside behind us.&nbsp;&nbsp; they make cracking noises like stone instead of wood.&nbsp; This roar is muuuuch more terrifying than the dragon's rorar.&nbsp; We look back over our shoulder and see an enormous creature.<br /><br />It is colossol, and has a frightful presence with a DC &lt;30.&nbsp; Ahead of us we can see that the trees are formed into strange shapes... sharp shapes... which suddenly rigid up and sharpen more.&nbsp; <br /><br />A huge reptilian thing...&nbsp; To quote curt.&nbsp; &quot;It's a tarrasque.&quot;<br /><br />The Echidnox call out a warning and the sharp things sharpen more...<br /><br />We Dive into the village Annnnnnnddddddd....&nbsp; <br /><br />Session called.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Haroun would have stated the following after the airship camped on the second night of the journey.&nbsp; This would have been before we slept for the night, at the end of which a quake occurred, and Haroun disappeared.&nbsp; Cameron, Sahrit, Gwen, Ed, Simone, Kith, and Patriana would all have heard the spiel.</p><p>---</p><p>I have said to you before that the gods are not real, and this is not entirely true.<br /><br />The truth of this matter is one of the great secrets of the old ones, however, and I believe it is part of the reason why I am being hunted.<br /><br />Prophecy is the light which shines through all things, and is the source from which all power comes.&nbsp; The gods are merely aspects of the whole, colored mirrors which reflect the true light.&nbsp; Through worship, through diligence, through careful preparation and sacrifice, you can focus the gods' light upon yourself, but then your power is merely a reflection of a reflection.&nbsp; Or, you can reflect the power of Prophecy, the source of the gods' power, itself.<br /><br />As a younger man, I was taught many things which I later learned were lies.&nbsp; This taught me to doubt.&nbsp; So, although I am a seer and a prophet, I do not claim to know the truth.&nbsp; I, like all of us, am merely a part of the whole, and so cannot see everything, or know everything.<br /><br />One of the things I was taught, which may have been a lie, was the nature of gods.&nbsp; Those who adhere to the gods know that they do not have power over all things; they have aspects of control, which I believe the priests call &quot;domains&quot; or &quot;portfolios&quot;.&nbsp; The interesting thing, however, is how these portfolios change over time.&nbsp; The bards, the historians, the oldest ones have noted that, from time to time, a god can lose - or gain - power over an aspect of reality.&nbsp; And so, it seems, the gods are not everlasting and eternal; they have not existed as they are since the beginning of time.&nbsp; We have seen them change.<br /><br />But how does this happen?&nbsp; The old ones have watched, and they have seen.&nbsp; First, the priests draw on the edges of their god's power, from the grey edge of things which border on the existing power the god can grant.&nbsp; It is more difficult than drawing from the god's domains, but it can be done.&nbsp; When the priests do this repeatedly, the people see, and they begin to believe that this is one of the domains of the god.&nbsp; And then, the priests find that the place they have been drawing becomes easier, and easier, until everyone agrees that this is one of the aspects over which the god has control.<br /><br />Do you see?&nbsp; Once everyone agrees that a god has power over a domain, then the god does - but the people do not agree because they see the god's nature.&nbsp; The god's nature becomes what the people agree it is.<br /><br />And this brings us to the heart of the matter; Moradin did not create the dwarves in his image; the dwarves created Moradin in theirs.&nbsp; And so it is with all the gods.</p>
