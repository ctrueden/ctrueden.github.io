      <p>Admatha's reactions to the rest of the events of the session also caused her to experience . . . feelings.&nbsp; Mostly pure, unadulterated rage and hate.&nbsp; It's much less interesting to read about, as for long periods of time she kind of lost coherence.&nbsp; However, perhaps at a later date, when more of her backstory is known, I&nbsp;will reveal some of those thoughts. </p>

      <p>Late in the evening, an Arx constible arrived in my quarters. I was politely arrested. Given the accusations laid at the feet of me and my companions, I am hardly surprised. And thus, in my cell, I waited. Patience is a virtue I have become accustomed to.</p><p>A warforged was provided to us as council, and soon we found ourselves facing trial, based upon our participation in the lineship incident. in truth, I found myself uncertain about how to defend my companions. Their participation is undeniable. And yet, what value is there in punishing them? Will it undo the events that transpired? Of course not. If anything it will serve only to impede them from working to avert the disasters that we all seem inexorably drawn to.</p><p>Justice, it was said, would be served. I gave that some thought, though I admit it was not the lineship that I considered, but the Emperor. What would be served by killing his assassin? I realized that it would not undo my failure. No, better to gain his aid in averting further tragedy. When next I see him, I will gain his assistance. By force, if necessary.</p><p>Logic and temperance. These virtues led to my next decision, agreeing to aid the Drow woman who had been posing as a goblin. If she speaks truth, than the situation is even worse than I had dared imagine. It seemed that I had little choice.</p><p>And still....even with so much at stake, I remember Iraja's plea. She did not simply ask for help. She asked <em>me </em>for help. And I could not. Did not. Gods, let me do something of use, let me not leave friends and duty behind in vain.</p>
