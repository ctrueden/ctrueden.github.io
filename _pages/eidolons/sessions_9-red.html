      <p>Entry 28:</p><p>The emperor was dispersed.&nbsp; Those damned clerics couldn't see past their prejudices and tried to destroy one of the only beings who know whats going on.&nbsp; If only I had known a Darkness spell powerful enough to allow me to jump, then I might have gotten there in time to help the emperor.&nbsp; That is the last time I have a bear lay on me.&nbsp; Its unfortunate how foolish Arwell can be, if she had not been so foolish we may have saved the emperor, or at least gotten more answers.&nbsp; She persisted even after we had proved there was something odd going on.</p><p>Now one of my only leads into what Anne might be is closed...for now.&nbsp; There is no telling if he will reconstitute himself or not, until then its to be more basic study for her.&nbsp; I'm pleased that there has been any progress at all, as most ghosts don't ever grow.&nbsp; For now we are preparing for the battle thats to come.</p><p>There are many questions to be answered at the home of this Marquee of the east, I can only hope that Isaline might find some solace in the fight that is sure to come.&nbsp; Things are coming to a head, and I am not sure we may like some of the answers we find.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p><div><span style="font-size: 9pt">Well the fates have decided to take me away from the Empire and give some damned fool errand in the ass end of nowhere.&nbsp; I find myself shifted from Midgard, in the middle of battle, to an airship flying over the deepest woods.&nbsp; Spectacular...none of my companions can or will explain exactly what we are doing here besides an assurance &quot;it is important&quot; to them.&nbsp; The rumors of giant monsters are proven true and we narrowly escape one giant beast to find ourselves in a primitive but impressive palisade.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size: 9pt">The echidnox and smaller oni population blather about the dangers of the spire, the apparent destination of this fool mission.&nbsp;There is some valuable information to be had eventually however.&nbsp;The spire, or Arcadia as the elder calls it, is forbidden and apparently an ancient temple of the gods and center of nexus energy.&nbsp;Now it makes sense why Ed and Simone are here, but there is little I can do here.&nbsp;Most interesting is that the Vanquisher is more than any man, he or maybe it is in fact an oni and former leader of this tribe.&nbsp;Ages ago he was known as Ojo Lanre (I wonder if true names really do have a power over demons and fey like the stories say) and failed to trap one of the giant beasts we observed.&nbsp;The title of Vanquisher would appear to be derogatory after his plan failed and lead to the destruction of the tribe.&nbsp;I am in no rush to find him, but perhaps this information could give some leverage against him.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span style="font-size: 9pt">The trip to the spire was rather uneventful, or from my point of view inside a portable hole it certainly was.&nbsp;Thankfully whatever force is behind the quakes decided to do me a favor and return me to the Empire.&nbsp;My excitement was quickly dampened by the sight of the priests of Bahamut destroying the emperor.&nbsp;He dissipated once again and I fear something a little more permanent might become of this.&nbsp;I was overjoyed to learn that this transpired with the interference of Arwel.&nbsp;I remain impressed with her continued uselessness and her wherewithal to even put a helmet on facing the right direction.&nbsp;While the Emperor&rsquo;s destruction is not her fault alone, the others said she interfered greatly and attacked the ghost herself.&nbsp;With his destruction civil war is almost guaranteed and a massive source of information silenced.&nbsp;Marquise Dragontamer has once again requested our help and with a lack of options we must accept his hospitality again.&nbsp;All I know is that far too much of our current predicament is unknown and some company is unreliable.</span></div>
