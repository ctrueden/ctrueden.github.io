      <p>I have so little time yet I devote myself to this single task. I don't know of any other way to even begin undoing Vance. The words of creation are a powerful tool, they should be as useful in the future as they are now. I need more thought, and for that I look for Kas. Being from outside this plane her death returned her from whence she came, but my work here in Arx should be able to bring here back. She is the only one other than me and my father that knows anything about the ritual that restored my Vance's power. Perhaps, our work together can help undo what we had done.</p><p>Eventually, what I needed to finish bringing her back made it's way to Arx, that being people with ties to her. I was surprised that Joseph was one of the people connected to her, Haron I had know. I had to bite back on some jealousy at the thought, I don't know if that was my emotions or my brothers, it is getting hard to tell.</p><p>The part of me that isn't writhing in his anger and hatred pities him. His last thought echoes in my mind, "Make me a victim of your powerlust. Make me a victim of your righteousness. Make me a victim of your weakness. Soon you will be victims of what happens to me." I know what he has done, and the only person he ever wronged was me. As we were there was no way to avoid it, the struggle between was inherent. That struggle is gone, but the line between us is&nbsp;blurred. I am the worse for it, but, maybe, I have left him with some of my mind, too, and he is the better for it. Maybe, that will matter should he ever be freed from Vance's clutches.</p>

      <p>Well well, it seems that peace talks have gotten somewhere that I dare to describe as useful.&nbsp; Arx was near the bottom of my list of Delphians I thought could be convinced to make a deal, but it appears they are just as worried about Terminus and the demons.&nbsp; With Intempestivus made useless and with Sibyl dragging her heels in negotiations I needed to investigate further.&nbsp; The presence of the Underdark delegation was a little surprising but they do have as much to lose as the rest of us.&nbsp; While the days were long it was not impossible to convince the Delphian representatives that the Empire could abide to an agreement of non-expansion while the most dangerous threat was taken care of.</p><p>After another day of discussions we came to an agreement in several parts:</p><p>1. A free flow of information in as timely a manner as possible between all three parties regarding defense against the demons, the remaining hordes, and this new order of quake enthusiasts.</p><p>2.&nbsp;To try and figure out how Beardthicket is removing Nexuses and speak to him and his group about his motives to a further degree before the Delphians make an official statement.</p><p>3. To work together when the time comes to strike at Terminus.&nbsp; Agreed that once the Demons and the Vanquisher have weakened each other that a large combined arms force could destroy both armies and retake Terminus.&nbsp; Likewise when Terminus is regained a combined council of representatives will determine the course of action to be taken about the nexus.</p><p>4. To not make open war or use mercenaries to undermine the other pact members until a time comes that a new agreement is reached.&nbsp; Violation of such will bring forced censure against said party by all other members.</p><p>5. To work together to discover a solution for the cities trapped in the quakes or if a successful magical/mundane defense is discovered to see it implemented by all powers.</p><p>6. An agreement that neither Delphia or the Empire will seek to expand their control to other free cities and that a council to best divide territory after this conflict will be formed.</p><p>7. That underdark residents will cease aggressions against&nbsp;other pact members&nbsp;for the time being and that they be allowed a part in defenses of remaining nexuses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A solid agreement that does not favor any one party to a great degree and provides some reproach should members try and undermine the process.&nbsp; I would have liked a commitment to a military alliance, but I will count my blessings and Haroun's gifts that we agreed to this.&nbsp; Likewise I have asked that Cameron free Joseph from his prison.&nbsp; It will take several days until we all gather at Elyria to see that it was successful, but I trust in all of their abilities to survive.&nbsp; I will have to ask Joseph about who he follows and why when I have the chance.&nbsp; Likewise I do not suspect Cameron knows that I see through&nbsp;'its' disguise and I must learn more about what exactly&nbsp;they can do.</p>

      <p>Entry 30: I&nbsp;didn't dare continue my diary during my...stay at Arx for fear of them breaking my code.&nbsp; I was unexpectedly released by a man working for Isaline.&nbsp; I didn't think they would easily enter the city during the war. &nbsp;I must admit I wasn't sure anyone would come for me.</p><p>I acted a bit foolishly at the jail, and went back for my sword.&nbsp; While I worked hard to enhance that sword, I went back for a little revenge.&nbsp; They forced me to kill many innocent people, while unwithering people who likely deserved to lose their lives.&nbsp; I will not back down from these people, and I will do all in my power to destroy those responsible.&nbsp; That is my only option at this point, though&nbsp;I will admit I&nbsp;somewhat relish the chance, for they will now send a far larger margin of mercenaries to get me under control.</p><p>The link is still broken.&nbsp; Thats about all I have to say about that right now.&nbsp; Maybe...maybe later.</p>
