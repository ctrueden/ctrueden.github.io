      <p>What is going on here?  I thought it was strange that the order was comprised of common people of all races.  At least for their nexus strike team, they are comprised of the same people.  The exact same people, with many different versions of themselves in the same reality.  I didn't know that was possible.  Sure, I've heard of people running into themselves before, though it's rare, but these individuals...  When I peer into the past of most people, I can see their history, and a few possibilities.  For my traveling companions, I usually see a point of focus, and a crack in the lens.  For these people, it's more like a hall of mirrors, with each showing something different.<br /><br />Whoever they are, they are dangerous.  Whoever, or whatever is behind this is infinitely more so.  I'm not the most learned geomancer, but I've never heard of anything that resembles this.  We've seen that the gods are meddling in the world.  I have to believe that one, or at least one, of them would have to be behind something of this magnitude.  Which one I don't know.  I've been ignoring them, and they've returned the favor for quite some time, but now it seems like I can't ignore them any longer.  I should start with Arwel, but I need to learn about these gods.<br /><br />....<br /><br />Damned ring!  I see that Kith has joined.  I hope this means that we get to have a few more adventures together.  The last quest was beyond anything I had yet experienced, and I'm looking forward to the next one.  But, why was one of the order wearing a ring?  And worst of all, how did the others find it first.  I'll have to keep on top of that in the future.  They now know that Kith and I have these rings.  We stonewalled them, each in our own way.  Kith outright refused, and I tried to explain that I really couldn't answer their questions.  It does scary me a little about how many questions about the guild I really can't answer, but I'll have to be okay with that for now.  Za'har was especially suspicious of us, and has enough authority to be quite formidable.  He is also someone I am mostly unfamiliar with, so he has ever right to be suspicious.  Thankfully Arwel and Ed were willing and able to vouch for our efforts to stop the ordering in Heimdal.  They would have failed if it weren't for my senses, and I was nearly killed trying to get into the nexus, twice!  Kith also greatly contributed to the effort, though I didn't really get to see any of it. <br /><br />Thankfully they had seen something like this before, and though our rings may be tied to the Fochlucan lyricists.  I have to admit that I haven't heard of them, but apparently Arwel and Sarit (no surprise there) are members.  And apparently they can communicate though them.  Wish our rings did that.  Well, maybe I don't.  Though I am glad that they have come to some level of acceptance, though I have undoubtedly lost a lot of trust.  I was able to give Za'har some info on the workings of the underdark, and he will return the favor by making sure that I'm not wanted in the Empire.  I'm sure they have bigger problems, but I just don't want to deal with getting caught.<br /><br />I'm not used to getting caught in a deception.  I've been able to talk my way into and out of anything for so long, that I have grown careless.  I can't rely on merely on my charms, but I also have to keep my wits about me at all times.  Especially now that I can't trust those around me.  I don't know if I'll be able to get that back, but I would like to.<br /><br />I have a lot of work ahead of me.  I need to find out what the guild knows about the order.  I need to learn about the gods and try to figure out who is responsible for this plague.  I need to keep my wits about me, and I need to do some major mending.  Maybe I should look Cameron up, see if he has any insight on this.</p>

      <p>Well it looks like it the details of the Ordering is clearing up.&nbsp; Many copies of the same lunatics follow a madman named Jonas.&nbsp; They believe him to be a geomancer of high power, but the evidence and our opinions make it much more likely he is simply a charismatic or controlling mastermind.&nbsp; His men seemed clueless to the damage that the Ordering caused outside of the cities and how their attack coincided with the release of the plague.&nbsp; The prisoner claimed that the cities were quite safe, but for now it remains impossible to verify.</p><p>I will hold on to the "Last Stand" for the time being.&nbsp; There is talk of returning stolen Norn arms/armor to Alexandria.&nbsp; However the fact that Oricalum is a target and that now Grazzt has seized control means we must make haste there, as insane as it may sound.&nbsp; Hunting down and eliminating Jonas will fall to others to take care of.&nbsp; The risks facing the double nexus are now far too important to not act immediately (as dangerous as rushing in will likely be).</p>

      <p><br />2/5/2010<br /><br /><br />Another quake brought us into a similiar situation as we've been in...&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaline and Zahar are there, but Arwel is gone.&nbsp; The enemies we defeated are not all in the same places.&nbsp; Their loot is still gone,. butt he Norn are still wearing their armor.&nbsp; We don't see the elf that was tied up, and the rope is gone.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; There is a half orc man outside... The one Arwel was talking to.&nbsp; He's wearing battle clothing/robes with his greataxe...&nbsp;&nbsp; we also see that the halfling is there and is tied up with Ed's rope.&nbsp; <br /><br />As we the Quake subsides, there's renewed calling for the guard.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar can't remember what he's done.&nbsp; <br /><br />The course of the battle was rather different, but we still one, clearly...<br /><br />Ed checks the Nexus... there has still not been an ordering here.&nbsp; One of the Norn has been stabilized.&nbsp; <br />The living Norn is bound.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />At this point, we see the mayor coming at us, a dozen people, 2 Norn among them.&nbsp; <br /><br />I explain my memories of the events of the fight.&nbsp; One of the Norns Present identifies that they're imposters...&nbsp; <br /><br />The half orc says he surrendered.&nbsp; Says he was part of the distraction force.&nbsp; "I would hgappily explain this if you wish to have me brought to the Barracks, I'll go willingly."&nbsp; <br /><br />What we're trying to find out:&nbsp; What sort of base of location does the brotherhood have.&nbsp; <br /><br />The half orc says he was approached.&nbsp;&nbsp; EWe were asked to safeguard this nexus under the impresion this was going to be attacked...&nbsp; The half orc is difficult to read but is not going out of his way to be deceptive, nbut the halfling is growing more and more nervous as she realizes that that's not what happened (I.E. that she was duped).&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar notices Kith and says to simone/kith "I wasn't expecting to see you here".&nbsp; Isaline flips up her eye patch and looks around.<br /><br />Isaline sees that the half orc is incredibly well dressed in actuality, Sees Simone as Simone.&nbsp; (Half orc, half dwarf).&nbsp;&nbsp; Also something else.&nbsp; The half orc says that the elf was of their group as well.&nbsp; He says he's an illusionist by trade.&nbsp; (So that spellcaster was him). <br /><br />The mayor is Kash Ekrell.&nbsp; He was originally a smith.&nbsp; When heimdall was invaded, he supplied a lot of arms and personally joined combat.&nbsp; He was subsequently elected and has been mayor for about 30 years.&nbsp; <br /><br />We should ask about the next target...&nbsp;&nbsp; How many operatives they have, what kind of hierarchy they have.&nbsp; <br />The same guys as whio ordered tatenda had beens ent to raid the outpost in the and are now here.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Apparently, we're the only bunch of people trying to stop orderings.&nbsp; There's another in from Tremsaryn.&nbsp; They're on their way here, should be here in a few days.&nbsp;&nbsp; They weren't able to prevent the ordering from taking place.&nbsp; (Also, Haroun isn't immediately visible).&nbsp; <br /><br />I detect poison on the Norn, he's got none.&nbsp; The Halfling is, Simone is carrying poison, as is the Mayor (It's alcohol).&nbsp; The norn also has nothign magical left.&nbsp; he's tied to the chain.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline casts Discern lies.&nbsp; It 'sticks'&nbsp; Isaline Stands behind him and shakes her head when he lies.<br /><br />I heal the Fake Norn to heal up.&nbsp; He looks pissed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp; If you answer simply, this is going to go better for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The Fake snorts...<br /><br />"Do you consider yourself an imperial citizen" (He thinks, then nods.)&nbsp; "Then do what I say" [Zahar is in the Outrider, says he's a Norn and outrider].<br /><br />'I work for the geomancers who were in the nexus.'<br />"And who did they work for?" (The guy knows the answer, but is reluctant to say).&nbsp; <br />Zahar says that he's likely to be held for treason...&nbsp;&nbsp; The Norn says That's going to ha[ppen anyway, even if I'm not cooperative...<br /><br />"Those Nexuses are a corruption of the world, they need to be destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The odering lets us do that."&nbsp; <br /><br />There are already imperial methods for doing this, you realize? {Zahar}<br /><br />"SOmething is wrong... This needs to be done."<br /><br />How are you so certain?<br /><br />'I was working with geomancers...&nbsp; they were certain of this.'&nbsp; I get the sense that he's not telling us anything.&nbsp; <br /><br />"You believe what you were doing is best for the empire?"<br /><br />'The best for the world.'&nbsp; <br /><br />"Then tell me why?"<br /><br />'The flow needs to be stopped.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something wrong with it.&nbsp; And we can fix it.&nbsp; And we have to fix it.'<br /><br />"That's not what happened at Tatenda"<br /><br />'In Tatenda the flow stopped'.<br /><br />"What of the area about it, or the plague of withered undead?"<br /><br />'(He doesn't know)'<br /><br />"(Zahar describes the warforged.)"&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; What do you know abotu the ordering and its effects.<br /><br />'If we can order all of the nexuses, the world can be saved'<br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; not what you believe, what you KNOW<br /><br />'I know its the right thing to do'<br /><br />Kith shows himself.&nbsp; says "If it is your intent to restore the inverted nexuses, why did you attack impentestivous...&nbsp; and Carthage/"<br /><br />'Because they were inverted' (He is being honest.&nbsp; He is firmly convinced this is the only way to do it and that it will bring good things.&nbsp; Kith Says they weren't... and is equally sure, and Isaline agrees).&nbsp; And Ed would have noticed if it had been inverted.&nbsp; (A few days ago, before it was inverted).&nbsp; A few weeks ago it was certainly not inverted.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Norn says that it had been inverted for two months.&nbsp; Claims that all the places they attacked were inverted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp; Who leads your cause?<br /><br />'(Pause)<br /><br />Ed asks if Norn knows what happens about a mile and a half outside of the nexuses.'&nbsp; <br /><br />'Please explain.'<br /><br />We explain the uber quakes nearby an ordered place.&nbsp; <br /><br />'The flow may have caused the undead, but we did not.'<br /><br />We explain that their irresponsible for not realizing what's going on with the maelstrom.<br /><br />He's confused by something about the other ordering attempts.<br /><br />"Three of my superiors&nbsp; were here.&nbsp; Ask them"<br /><br />Zahar asks him to tell him who leads his cause.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Norn Seems to consider what he's said and believes that if he gives us that information we may find the same truth that he did.<br /><br />'The man who leads us is an elf.&nbsp; His name is Jonas, He brought us together and explained what's wrong with the inverted nexuses.&nbsp; '<br /><br />'If you Find Jonas, he will explain better...'<br /><br />How do we find him?<br /><br />'He finds you.'<br /><br />Simpone:&nbsp; You said before this wasto shape the world as it should be?<br /><br />'The flow is an evil on this world and it needs to stop.'<br /><br />Kith:&nbsp; Where were you when you saw jonas.<br /><br />'I was in tatenda at the time, I was recruited there.'<br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; Where was your next target?<br /><br />'This is the only one I knew.'<br /><br />Jonas told them the directions personally (He spoke to the geomancers... just the 6 of you).&nbsp;&nbsp; Norn thinks that Jonas is probably a geomancer.&nbsp; (OOC:&nbsp; He's not a geomancer).&nbsp; My assumption was that he was nomadic<br /><br />The halfling and half orc are looking increasingly uncomfortable.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith asks for extradition to the wastes as a representatives of the fey for crimes against them.<br /><br />THe Dwarf says "I haven't been into the wastes and done any things."&nbsp;&nbsp; But the twist of the flow flow may have brought you there.<br /><br />'That&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask if he knows about the maelstrom.&nbsp; <br /><br />he says it brings the world back to how it was 'supposed to be.'<br /><br />He has no idea how to meet Jonas, really.<br /><br />The mayor has guards take the fake norn out as wella s the halfling and half orc.&nbsp; <br />The Norn are selected by the emperor himself and passing onesself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith asks:&nbsp; Have any Norn armors been lost?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Kith wants the guy executed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Norn armor is made for that person to wear it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's fitted for that person.. so these are good fakes of Norns...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THey're so well fitting it'd be obvious.&nbsp; And its produced in alexandria.&nbsp; So these are fascimilies.&nbsp; (Norn armor bears makers marks of a person in alexandria.&nbsp;&nbsp; They -always- have makers marks...&nbsp; a good forgery includes knwoing what it looks like and where it goes and such.<br /><br />Ed goes to talk to the criminals and I go with.&nbsp; Zahar and Isaline speak.<br /><br />We ask the fake norn:<br />Ed:&nbsp; "You know about the attack on impentestivous, how did you know it was a target (That it was inverted)."&nbsp;&nbsp; How did you know specifically that city?<br /><br />'Oh, all inverted nexuses will be ordered in time.'&nbsp; <br /><br />'They're all targets... did you not hear me?&nbsp; Every single one needs to be ordered'&nbsp;&nbsp; What about the noninverted nexuses?&nbsp; 'They aren't our targets... I don't knwo why... maybe the ordering doesn't work'.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask why they've only decided to strike recently.&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't knwo why they started, per se.&nbsp; Maybe the demons made things worse...&nbsp; <br /><br />Right now, what delphian cities are not inverted:&nbsp;&nbsp; Orraculum is both inverted, Impen is ordered, arx and terminus is inverted.&nbsp; Factum is not inverted, and one other.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask if they were inverted in his memory...&nbsp; those three spreading like cancer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask why he attacked the imperial ones, we tell him abotu the 5 in the swamps.&nbsp; He didn't know about them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith asks if Jonas is a spellcaster, Fake norn says 'I don't know, I assume he's a geomancer since he knows about the <br /><br /><br />I Tell Zahar that his masters had inspiration about walking the middle path.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Our goals:&nbsp; We need to locate Jonas.&nbsp; The next place to go would be a delphian city with a nexus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oraculum is a big target, because TWO nexuses, and BOTH inverted.&nbsp; <br /><br />'If we can revert nexuses woudl the ordering be necessary'&nbsp;&nbsp; "The inverted nexus makes the ordering easier, it doesn't mean that the flow isn't caused by them."He is under no charms or compulsions.<br /><br />'I am sure once the inverted nexuses are dealt with we'll find a solution for the others.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we had a way to invert them and order them, that would solve the problem' (Doesn't even know if its possible).&nbsp; <br /><br />WE should check out the makers mark in Alexandria if the mayor can get us there easily.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Ed has an odd design etched into his right hand... he didn't have it before.&nbsp; It's not magical, but it might be an arcane mark.&nbsp; Ed can't recall having this.&nbsp; This is the first time he noticed it.<br />The sword was named 'last stand'&nbsp;&nbsp; It was one of the first weapons made to be made for the Norn...&nbsp; The possessor cannot retreat.&nbsp; it is a +1 sure striking vicious bastard sword.&nbsp; It went missing when the bonded Norn died.&nbsp; <br /><br />Joel and I identify the magics.&nbsp; Ed asks joel how he identifies.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Shield Gives HIGH SR but negates teh abnility of magic...&nbsp;&nbsp; It's part fo the set that the sword was in.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; <br />Ther mayor says to contact the Delphians with what we found out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline takes the bastard sword and the mark that was on ed disappears... and it appears on Isaline.&nbsp; <br /><br />The large steel shield.&nbsp; It can grat the SR 1/day.&nbsp; The Su abilities don't work.&nbsp; But abilities from merit points are good.&nbsp; Zahar takes the shield for holding onto now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline take sthe bastard sword and the amulet<br /><br />Ed's haversack has the shield put in it until the <br /><br />We breakfest in our&nbsp; tavern... and there's a disturbance at the table next to us.&nbsp; A portal opens....&nbsp; Isaline recognizes it... a portal to a shadowy realm... Isaline led us through one...<br /><br />People step through in an opaque way... They blink and look around confused.<br /><br />We see:<br /><br />Six:&nbsp;&nbsp; A dragonborn wearing male to identify him as an outrider (Captain kasian, whom Zahar recognizes).&nbsp; Zahar also recognizes:&nbsp;&nbsp; hessia, his former student...&nbsp; she looks confused...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; next is the spitting iomage of Sahret.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth is a troll who none of us have met (He is massive and looks like a troll warrior shaman with a filthy club and he's a totally a typical troll, it looks like.&nbsp; He does NOT stink, but he should.) fifth is a dwarf dressed in robes, a holy symbol of unknown origin, a fervent look in his eyes...&nbsp; maybe he's just crazy kinda...&nbsp; the 6th person to step through:&nbsp; a young girl who appears to be the human equivalent of 11 or 12 with wings and she's hefting a spiked chain.&nbsp; She's the only one who doesn't look surprised.&nbsp; She is Ann, for sure, an elf girl.&nbsp; This is Ann of Mark's character.&nbsp; <br /><br />The troll sniffs the air and says "What the hell is this place"?<br /><br />Hessia looks at zahar, eyes grow wide and she shrinks away.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar is rather confused...&nbsp;&nbsp; he also addresses Captain kasian...<br /><br />Kasian:&nbsp; "I apologize for the abruptness of our arrival."<br /><br />Ann:&nbsp; "The lady takes us where we are needed."&nbsp; (The raven queen).<br /><br />"We are here to speak with peopel about the ordering at Trimsaran."<br /><br />Kasian suggests we meet with the mayor.&nbsp; We get breakfast first...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The troll's name is BG. ericks goldsmith&nbsp;&nbsp; Sahret seems reserved but remembers all of us.&nbsp; hessia, Kasian, Ann are the othersIt is eladrin sahret.<br /><br />(I detect evil)&nbsp;&nbsp; BG is evil, Sahret is evil (he's got the evil handprint in him), the others are not.<br /><br /><br />Hessia asks Zahar if he's a rakshasa... I saw you fall.. Zahar is like no....&nbsp; "Well, that makes sense, since hte empire is still intact in this reality."&nbsp;&nbsp; (In her world, she explains that there was a Powerful deva who fell to a rakshasa and went on rampage.)<br /><br />I don't sense any antipathyf rom Sahret towards us, he simp[ly seems wary.&nbsp; other than that, hard to say.&nbsp; <br /><br />hessia says it has been a number of years... That Zahar went on a mission ot find himself, but instead lost himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith asks BG:&nbsp; "Unseelie?"&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What?'&nbsp; "Unseelie?"&nbsp;&nbsp; 'what?'&nbsp; The troll is surprisingly hard to read.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ann remains quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar fills Hessia.&nbsp; <br /><br />He pauses, looks at Kith:&nbsp; "He must not be named!&nbsp; to do so would ben a great blasphemy!"<br /><br />Kith:&nbsp; 'So how do you refer to him'<br /><br />"To give him a name would be forbidden, do yuou not see?&nbsp; We can only speak him in the direct..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is the all father. of all gods"&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is the crazy priest)&nbsp; The priest is completely fucking batshit insane.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone else is kinda nervous about this.&nbsp; Sahret is a bit less nervous than the others and more apathetic...<br /><br />Kith is indulging the crazy priest...&nbsp; "Would you do me the honor of naming his children?"<br /><br />'You knwo them all, don't you?'&nbsp;&nbsp; THose that birth the races; Corellon, Moradin and all the rest.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone:&nbsp; "Where did you get that amulet"<br /><br />'It came to me in a dream!' (Yes, it did, says sense motive.&nbsp; When he said 'he must not named, he doesn't know his name, but also really does believe that the god he follows shouldn't be named)<br /><br />Serving hte Fey is its own reward, says Kith.<br /><br />"I don't think so.&nbsp; Let's just eat breakfast."&nbsp; <br /><br />We finish out breakfat...&nbsp; Kasian talks about what happened at trimsaaran, but says wait for the mayor...&nbsp;&nbsp; he probes.&nbsp; They seem pleased with the ordering.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed Asks how they got through without being effected by the quake<br /><br />Kasian says "For all we know we were effected.... *Glances to Hessia*", but we managed to get free... quakes changed thigns... quyickly at times.&nbsp; but we got through."<br /><br />Between a high number of ddays and a low number of weeks.&nbsp; <br /><br />We go to the mayor.<br /><br />The mayor asks for an explanation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kasian explains that they had recieved information that led them to believe that there would be another ordering... (Looks at erikson)&nbsp; This was accurate, but we were too late.&nbsp;&nbsp; We fought our way inside the nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; we killed two of the three inside... the third recieved a surge of power and was slain outright.&nbsp; There was an elf, halfling, eladrin, two dwarves, <br />dragonborn.&nbsp; <br /><br />We suggest that we go and look at the bodies of the impersonators.&nbsp; Bodies have been laid out, they're all there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Something is bothering zahar as we go into the temple of Moradin.&nbsp; <br /><br />"These are, without a doubt the same people "<br /><br />"This is dark magic!&nbsp; It cannot be allowed to continue!"&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask of clone magic...&nbsp;&nbsp; there are legends of divine interventions to do this thing.&nbsp; More likely geomantic magic.&nbsp; <br /><br />Most likely explanation:&nbsp; the same people because the flow fucked with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask the other adventurers...&nbsp;&nbsp; if they have a way to divine where they are.<br /><br />the topic of sscrying using their bodies is brought up.&nbsp; it's a possibility.&nbsp; The mayor poitns out that he did find standard minor magical things and found somethign he found a bit strange...&nbsp;&nbsp; "I found this on one of the corpses... when i gave it to someone else to look at....&nbsp; "&nbsp; *He dons it and it vanishes, I don't see it, Isaline and kith do*&nbsp;&nbsp; "All it seems to do is become invisible when donned. "<br /><br />It's a fairly ordinary ring.&nbsp; Kith has one too...&nbsp;&nbsp; So does Simone...&nbsp;&nbsp; Whjen one dons the ring, they can see the rings on other people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp; "Give me that ring"&nbsp;&nbsp; To Kith... "No."<br /><br />The dwarf takes the ring.<br /><br />Kith was genuinly surprised that this guy had a ring. <br /><br />Kith says he didn't find his... he was given one...&nbsp; The mayor says hte ring is clearly visible on their dead hand.&nbsp; <br /><br />"It is deeply personal and private information I choose not to share "Says Kith.<br /><br />The mayor sends sendings to the Marquis... the regent and the regent's assistant.<br /><br />Which body was the ring found on?&nbsp; A geomancer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The eladrin.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed asks Simone...&nbsp;&nbsp; we ask Simoen what the eladrin was doing.&nbsp; Doesn't remember who was doing what.<br /><br />We ask why they're trying to conceal the ring?&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says he doesn't feel comfortable telluing us what the ring is about.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says he truly believes this is irrelevant, but he's beginning to doubt.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simonel&nbsp; ":finding this ring here changes nothing"<br /><br />Kith:&nbsp; "Or if it does, not much."<br />I ask how Simone was blinded outside the tower...&nbsp; Simone:&nbsp; "That was the result of a Vision".&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />I scry using the body of the eladrin.<br /><br />I find them!&nbsp;&nbsp; I see something.&nbsp; I see that person surrounded by those other people in many different circumstances simultaneously.&nbsp; KLike I am seeing a bunch of images superimposed... and there are a LOT of them.&nbsp; Like looking through a compound eye and each one sees a different image.&nbsp; Some are hanging out, on the road, in an inn, at a nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a shit ton of them... many dead ones and many living ones... and they're doing a variety of things, but none are actively orderin that I see.&nbsp; I don't see anybody out of place among them...&nbsp; I focus all my concentration to try and cut through the different views.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm looking for anyone powerful enough presence to be this Jonas... there's a small corner of my mind saying that some of the quadrants are blank... some are inacccessible.&nbsp; Like this scrying may have failed in some circumstances... not like normal 'nondetection' or 'Target does not exist'...&nbsp; It's not somethign I've experienced before.<br /><br />None of the scrying felt quite real.&nbsp; <br /><br />I pass along the scrying... most of the adventuring party 2 is listening.&nbsp; Ed knows celestial...&nbsp;&nbsp; the crazy guy is speaking in crazytalk (Which has at least some primal).&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone offers that we can probably find out who these people were before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ann:&nbsp; "If they can only do the ordering"<br /><br /><br />Hessia took Zahar about 15 feet away.&nbsp; BG is there.&nbsp; They're talking, and suddenly,c crazy guy stops babbling and suddenly stands and says says "My brother is not worhy of calling himself a dwarf any more!"<br /><br />Zahar clarifies (Beardthicket?)<br /><br />"I disown him!&nbsp; Destroying nexuses will cause the release of a monster! "<br /><br />"Do you know what monster, what face it has?!"&nbsp; (Zahar)<br /><br />'The World devourer!'.&nbsp; <br />Zahar:&nbsp; "No... that doesn't sound right..."<br /><br />Kith:&nbsp; "Is grazzt not answer enough?"<br /><br />Grazzt... Asmodeus... what does it matter?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />'I must second that the collapsing of the nexuses is foul'<br /><br />Oraculum is still inverted.&nbsp; <br /><br />The copies iu saw are often identical and always very similarly equipped.<br /><br />We ask how they knew that other city would be attacked, adn he look sat Erick...&nbsp;&nbsp; Erick says "He told me... We -HAD- to be there!"<br /><br />Ann says "He wouldn't shut up about it."<br />We ask about demons coming out of the nexuses...&nbsp; The imperials say it's something that happens very infrequently...&nbsp; all of the nexuses are warded against teleportation... and the norns kill them quickly.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The weak demons can't even get out... every few decades one breaks out and is killed byu the norns.&nbsp; <br /><br />ERick says "I was hoping my traitorous... breadthicket... would show, but no such luck!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Erick "I am aware.. it is only a matter of time until he [beardthicket] is stopped."&nbsp; Said suddenly bvery serene.&nbsp; He -really- hates his brother.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith:&nbsp; "Your zeal is remarkable."&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone:&nbsp; "I find it surprising that you two travelled with her so much... perhaps because you aren't fleshies. In my travels she seemed she had an axe to grind."<br /><br />I will scry the norn armor, looking for the makers mark and everything... see if its identicle.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />"There are surface tension issues with the planes...&nbsp; you can't look out of or into the soup of the flow".&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline thinks Ed and I are people now. (OOC)<br /><br />I'm going to scry on the wearer of the armor.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline sends a sending, vania replies "Grazzt control oraculum now... any defense lies with him, unfortunately."&nbsp; The delphians will consider the deicision.&nbsp; Grazzt wi;ll not be told.&nbsp; <br /><br />About 45 minutes in to the scrying, Elonna dune shows up, still wearing the livery of the emperor personal guard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemz Zahar sent for her or something.&nbsp; <br /><br />The others go and check with the prisoner.&nbsp; To see if he knows of the others.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says "I blame the flow."<br /><br />"Jonas is doing the right thing, it makes sense that other mes would be doing the same thing."<br /><br />And we mention that having that many copies is very unusual...&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't seem to think much of it... he's not much of a geomancer.&nbsp; <br /><br />'If you talk to Jonas, you'll probably work under him just like Myself.'<br /><br />Kith "I'm beginning to see how its possible that there are hjundress of you"<br /><br />'much as I hate the flow, I'm interested.'<br /><br />"This may be because your master is doing it to get mighty flow control"<br /><br />'Thatr weaponm and that shield, where did you get them?'<br /><br />"I was given them by Jonas to accomplish the mission.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a geomancer, he could have jappened on them... he just handed them over to help me." (After some prodding by Zahar)<br /><br /><br /><br />My scrying succeeds.&nbsp; I experience a similar phenomenon...&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever this phenomenon is is also effecting the geomancer snad the fake norns.&nbsp; I see them together a lot again, jsut from a bit of a different perspective.&nbsp; The same thing is going on...a gain, some are scrambled/jammed.&nbsp; He's not wearing it all the time.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We're ready to leave heimdall.&nbsp;&nbsp; We teleport.&nbsp; end session.<br /><br />(Kith called the plot, Paul gets a plot point!)<br /><br />Mass combat discussion.&nbsp; Perhaps run it more like a terrain rather than a thing.&nbsp; Maybe call out enemies you want.<br /><br />Maybe make each class work a bit differently.&nbsp; Or like each character can choose 'talents' of some sort, that are mass combat 'feats'.&nbsp; Maybe make the number of them based on class types<br /><br />Maybe different types of units... Horsemen, casters, etc.<br /><br />engage more enemies/allies. .. vanquisher, Grazzt...&nbsp; into things.<br /><br /><br />I got (And so did ed, to an extent), the plot dump about the 9 hells, possible god relations, (I also got tiamat/Io/Bahamut).</p>
