      <p>Another one. I've experienced two quakes since we created the balanced nexus, and both of them have felt like reality collapsing instead of changing. I don't know what changed this time, as it seemed like my reality was dominant this time. Kith, Arwel and Za'har joined Dariel, Ed and me. I didn't get a chance to talk to them about what they were up to, as the Vanquisher showed up yet again. He seems to be a popular guy with whoever is doing this. I was scrying him at the time, to see how he faired in Terminus, and then he appeared before us. Now he thinks I summoned him. I tried to dissuade him, but maybe I did have a part in it?<br /><br />At least it was convenient. It saved us the trip to Terminus, and allowed all of the members of this little coalition we've founded to meet. Of course, everyone wants to try to finagle as much power and influence as they can get. And of course, not everyone gets along. The Vanquisher doesn't want the Delphians involved, no one wants the empire, and even I'm a little dubious about the denizens of the Underdark. But we don't have commitments from either group yet. Za'har has offered his word that he will bring warriors, but he hasn't secured them yet.<br /><br />Also, to make life a little more uncomfortable for Sybil, both the Vanquisher and possibly the empire will require Delphia's aid in transporting their troops. Sybil couldn't make this commitment herself, but promised to check. She and the Vanquisher will stay with the warrior tribe to await their answer. We headed out to the Underdark.<br /><br />I tried to scry the magistrate, but expected failed. I scried his room, but saw that he has a replacement. Others were scrying the room as well, and we were noticed, so at least nothing has changed there. The real question is what has changed? We dressed Arwel up as a drow, let Dariel sink into the stone, hid Kith in my bag, and Za'har and Ed hid in a portable hole. We managed to learn a few interesting things. Most of their military is devoted to protecting the nexuses from Beardthicket. Also, their was a revolt of the warlocks a few weeks ago that has yet to be resolved. That's a story unto itself.<br /><br />Back to the story at hand. Back as our normal selves, we were able to get an audience with the Matron of the lead house in Tataclenia. My affiliation with the magistrate helps open doors. To boil it down, they are unable to commit because they are occupied. They need their situations resolved before they can help. She would have promised support if I could have promised the heads of Beardthicket and the &lt;?&gt; on a plate. I'm not in a situation to make those promises, so I thanked her for her time, and the tea and cookies, and we were dismissed.<br /><br />We returned above ground to discuss our options. Taking care of Beardthicket would free up troops from the empire, and from the Underdark, but finding has so far proven to be impossible. He was caught up in a trap once, but he still escaped. We decided to see what was up with the Warlocks. We also thought that Naxk was involved.<br /><br />We went to the other Underdark city to see if we could talk to the renegade Warlocks. Word is that they burned their contracts with Asmodeus and signed a new one with Baalzebul. I didn't know this was possible, but anything to weaken Asmodeus grip is welcome. We met with the magistrate of this city and were able to convince him to let us negotiate... and reconnoiter. We just needed to speak with the leader of the group warlocks that were surrounding the palace.<br /><br />He was a piece of work. He would only agree to tell his forces not to target us, and he could promise more than that. Oh, and he tried to bind me to an oath to tell him first what I saw in there. I had offered to tell him, but he wouldn't budget without an oath, and I wasn't about to give it. I mentioned that the matron wouldn't look favorably on our deaths, and we left to enter the Palace. The guards at the door made us wait for a minute or two, but allowed us entry. We were lead in and were allowed to see who was inside. Baalzebul was there, along with the emperor that Kith assassinated. Beazibul rules the seventh level of hell, a realm that became a hell where the empire was too successful. I don't know what this means, or what he wants, and I'm a little uncomfortable with this, but I hope this is bad for Asmodeus.</p>
