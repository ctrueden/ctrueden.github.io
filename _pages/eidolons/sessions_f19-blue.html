      <p>Yes, yes it was all real. In fact, there is more to this than I had imagined, and I’m not sure how I feel about it.<br /><br />Before I knew it, the next day was upon us. As agreed, we returned to the white priest’s cave. The red had departed, but the others remained. I wanted to ask them to join our cause.<br /><br />Maybe that this point I should pause for a moment. By our, I really meant me and Za’har and the others that have chosen to travel with us. And by cause, I mean taking back Oraculum. There are goals and issues awaiting us on the other side, but now that the ordering is has been dealt with, this is the cause in front of us.<br /><br />But now ‘our’ extends well past out small, evershifting bands. We now have the support of the Vanquisher, the T’Sen tribe, the rogue warlocks from the Underdark under Bazibul and the recently departed Emporer, Sybil, and the Delphian forces she can muster, along with Dragontamer and Ironheart from the empire. The drow from the Underdark haven’t pledged their allegiance yet, but as it is obviously in their best interests to do so, I have confidence that they will.<br /><br />But there is even more interest in retaking Oraculum from Demogorgon than even that. The gods themselves are getting involved. I would like to say that they have joined our cause at our request, but I didn’t ask them to join, and ‘usurped’ seems a more accurate term than joined. <br /><br />Back to my story... We were visiting the dragon priests when a god (I’m told it was Ioun) sent everyone a message. There is to be a gathering of a council to deal with Demogoron in seven days time. By everyone, I don’t mean everyone in the world, but everyone interested in our cause. I know this is a little vague, but when I asked, I didn’t get a clear answer on who had received the message. After receiving the message, the priests decided to send the green as their delegate to the council. <br /><br />We left, but before we could truely be on our way, we received a blessing. I wish I could have refused, but I was not given any such choice. Actually I wish I could refuse the gods’ involvement in this at all, but I doubt I get much say in that either. At least we have the same goal for the moment.<br /><br />That would be the end of it, except that this blessing is from Therisdun himself. Maybe he’s a kindred soul in wanting to be rid of the other gods. I have to assume that it’s in his best interest to either exile Demogorgon or reclaim the balanced nexus. Can’t really ask him, so I have no choice but to accept it and continue on.<br /><br />I decided to check on Za’har, see how his efforts were going. He was in a version of the Empire ruled by Ironheart. Dragontamer’s wife’s treachery was never discovered, and he was eventually killed. Za’har did bring me some disturbing news. There’s a shapeshifter that now possesses the sword. Za’har suspects that he has a guild ring, and that he was responsible for Dragontamer’s death. I promised to see if I could see a ring, and let him know what I could find out. I don’t know if this is the Magistrate or another.<br /><br />I’m not sure what to make of this. The guild hasn’t asked anything of me since locating Sigil. I relished their ability to shake the Priestess of the Black, but since that time, I’ve grown more and more warry. Kith has also joined, but he has his reservations. He wanted to sacrifice the rings in Oraculum, but they weren’t sufficient. I still have my ring, and I really haven’t given it a lot of thought in a while. Though disregarding them seems dangerous. I don’t know if this is something I can just quit, or even if I want to. I don’t know what their goals or reasons are, so it’s hard for me to act. Maybe once this is done I can look into them more.<br /><br />We arrived at the city hosting the council meeting. We got here as fast as we could, so we’re a little early. The city is built like a fortress. It doesn’t have the exposed tubing of other Delphian cities, but shifting plates. We were questioned at the wall, checked against a list, and admitted. I learned later that they are refusing entry for even citizens of the town. Seems a little pointless to me, especially since we were still attacked.<br /><br />But before that, we were directed to a large, red, important looking hotel. We were each given a room on the first floor. A few of my companions enjoyed playing with all the gnomish devices provided. Even the first floor is well apointed.<br /><br />We didn’t stay long. I popped my head into the dining area, and saw a chieftain I recognized. Before I could say hello, several gods entered the hotel. They were checked into rooms on the second floor. We were treated well as guests, but they were treated with reverence. <br /><br />We made it out to a bar down the street, and a great time was had by all. Sahrit played wonderful music all night. I chatted up some locals. It’s been so long since I’ve just had a night to relax and enjoy the place, I felt out of practice. Thankfully most of the gents were too stunned, or drunk, to notice any mistakes. This is where I found out about the strict admittance policy, and that the general public is unaware of the upcoming gathering. A few of the gods did stop by the bar and cause quite a stir.<br /><br />We stumbled into our beds for the night, after purging the alcohol from our systems. We didn’t make it through the night without getting attacked. There was a great noise. Admatha shouted that there was an invisible intruder. I poped over to Arwel’s room so that I could quake her into her armor. I’ve grown used to sleeping in my leathers throughout my travels. Arwel tends to wear quite a bit more, and I imaging that sleeping in it would be impossible, even for me, let alone someone softer.<br /><br />Arwel charged out into the hall. When I followed, someone shouted that he had run up the stairs. I tried to give chase, but all I could do was tell it was a shape shifter. I’m not sure if this was the magistrate, the sword bearer, or another. But Sahrit and Barnebus were able to stop it before I could catch up.<br /><br />There were also attacking hordes outside. There was an earthquake, and a huge tear in the street outside. The gods and our white dragon had gotten involved. I rush downstairs, then outside, but by the time I made it there, things were mostly resolved. Za’har, Biger, and others were there as well. Maybe they heard the commotion and came running?<br /><br />The ground was getting further and further away. It seems like the city itself is flying! This truly is a remarkable city. But how did our enemies reach us? And who were they, and who sent them? Was the guild behind the attack? If so, why? Lots more questions, but I’ll have to wait to get answers.<br /><br />PS. While musing on Therisdun’s motives, I had a thought. I can’t confirm this, though I know nothing to deny it. I believe that Therisdun is trapped within the world itself. There is speculation that the network of nexuses exists to keep him trapped. I wonder if he has been absorbing all of the negative nexus energy? This could explain why balanced nexuses turned positive over time. It could also explain why negative nexuses collapse over time, but positive nexuses seem stable. I’m not sure how to test this, or what it means, but I shall need to keep my eyes open.</p>
