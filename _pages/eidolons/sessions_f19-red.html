      <p><br />We did reclaim the ironwood.&nbsp; <br /><br />We leave Tatenda through the ironwood ship again.&nbsp; dariel has the thing...&nbsp;&nbsp; we go back out into the quakes and after a fairly short period of time, Dariel and I are left, Ed and Zahar.&nbsp; <br /><br />Enough has been happening that a god is looking at us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We get to choose as players which...&nbsp; We choose Pelor.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have Pelor's saving.&nbsp; +5 perception, Darkvision or LLV.&nbsp; Or we may give up the benefit for the rest of the day a 1 use real daylight thing that can't be suppressed by mortal darkness spells.&nbsp; <br />I choose darkvision, the others get +5 perception.<br /><br />We feel as though we have been touched a god.&nbsp; I'm familiar with the divine feeling.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel explains Calenon.&nbsp; ironheart is with us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed tells me I should tell the order of the common shield's survivors about <br /><br />We get a sending from someone we ahven't met.&nbsp;&nbsp; The voice has a vibrance and strength to it.&nbsp; "The time has come for prophecy to coalesce into reality within one weeks time, all champions shall be gathered within factum for a war council. from one another you will draw strngth to overcome adversity, and by your righteous hand Oraculum shall be liberated from evil."<br /><br />The leader of factum is artemis, a male eladrin... he's grandiose and superior, but this guy isn't the sender.&nbsp; Ironheart also stopped when the sending came in.&nbsp; ironheart says likely those who have been gathering for this...&nbsp; likely the plenipotentiaries, the marquis, some regional leaders of the underdark... beyond that, I'm not certain...&nbsp;&nbsp; not fewer than 2 dozen people, I suspect.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We are going to talk to the order of hte common shield about some volunteers.&nbsp; I do so, anmd they're willing to tend to the sufferers.&nbsp; The 4 who survived the plague attack volunteer to fight as well because they're pretty awesome and knwo its more about just people infighting.&nbsp; Everyone else is teaming up on the demons, so they're just fine coming in.&nbsp; <br /><br />We get free transport for alexandria.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel lets the council know that Calenon is willing to discuss what happened there...&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel also says they have ironheart.&nbsp; Ironheart is pretty confident about his coldiron weapons supply.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a lot of shit to do, but we're willing to talk to him.&nbsp; Ironheart is the current region in this street.&nbsp; In this reality, Dragontamer was murdered, the investigation is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; What they've foudn was that he was poisoned significantly, but the fatal wound was delivered by a knife.&nbsp; His wife is missing.&nbsp; Zahar wonders how she had heard that people knew that she was poisoning.&nbsp; Oraculum is still balanced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barring the influence of the flow, only the people Zahar .&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna dune knew, but not that they were going to see him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He met one other person...&nbsp;&nbsp; apart from Egorin.&nbsp; The sword carrier was also told.&nbsp; Zahar wonders where the fuck that guy is, and is sick of this shit.&nbsp; Zahar thinks about who has had it.&nbsp; Arwel, Mordlwyn, Kith, Kosk.&nbsp; JOn says that Kith for certain did not have the sword until after dragontamer's wife went missing.&nbsp; Kith has it now.&nbsp; Its one of the weapons that he carries.&nbsp; One of the two shortswords he currently carries has the same material as that sword...&nbsp; He can draw connections between Kith and dragontamers wife and that guy who was the carrier that they didn't know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jon also adds that Kith had the sword and dragontamers wife went missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; This other guy has the sword, and dragontamer's wife presumably killed him.&nbsp; When&nbsp; Dragontamer recovered, he became the regent, when he was killed, Ironheart did.&nbsp; Zahar also realizes that there are the fucking rings... those ones that are invisible when they're being worn.&nbsp; That sword carrier probably had one and used it to communicate to the wife or someone else.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel and I swap parts and such.&nbsp; Most of the common shield order is in the northwest.&nbsp;&nbsp; because the vanquisher was about.&nbsp;&nbsp; We mention there'll be a muster to them, and to meet up witht he imperial troops so we can get some.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed asks how Zahar feels, given that he's now human.&nbsp; Zahar has considered a lot about the truth of his nature and hte nature of his people and what that statement even means.&nbsp; He says that much of what he learned of the devas is strue, but it is not a complete truth...<br /><br />(The response from Sahret's Sending says basically, he doesn't know about any rings other than those possessed by Fochlucan.&nbsp;&nbsp; He may have more things to say as well. They're going to have a meeting...&nbsp; )&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar and Egorin are Scry/messaged.&nbsp; Zahar mentions that Dariel has provided the opportunity to speak with him.&nbsp; wonders if any progress has been made for gathering the students of the heaven and hell fists, but many are distant...&nbsp;&nbsp; many will come, but it will takea&nbsp; while.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking the off duty Norns is also somethign that's happening, but its going slowly and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Egorin feels like they do understand the problem.&nbsp; The acolytes will come when they can.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are scattered enough in their wanderings that it'd be difficult to gather them quickly, even with teleportation...&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe a months time in a significant amount of time to make a difference.&nbsp; Egorin says he might be at the council as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scry is dropped.<br /><br />Dariel says that if for some reason the sending we recieved from the individual speaking for us to arrive in Factum.&nbsp; We mention that the former emperors may also be at that meeting... we ask how that'll play with the empire there.&nbsp; but they have no authority over the empire.&nbsp; Also,s they have no authority in htis council, really.&nbsp;&nbsp; According to imperial law, Ironheart will be representing the empire, they will not have power.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar mentions that he had told the old empereros that he would do it.&nbsp; We suggest that we get them.&nbsp; Dariel begins scrying.&nbsp; Ironheart was aware of the factions but not that one of the factions was led by Baalzebul.&nbsp; Zahar says that whether or not he agrees with these people, they're peopel to whom he's sworn oaths of brothership who because of their good beliefs would be facing off against eachother.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel begins scrying on Dardenal (peacekeeper... the most recently dead emperor).&nbsp; He manages to get them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are both in the same room near eachother.&nbsp;&nbsp; Baalzebnul notices the scrying sensor, is not surprised, He casts the message.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Zahar wishes to speak to you"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They look at eachother and nod.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dar says "What is the issue?<br />'Sorry for the intrusion...&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume you have recieved the message about the meeting.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar tells them that Ironheart will show up, and They are like "sure".&nbsp; They say that it is likely they will be able to arrive on the day.&nbsp; They say their goodbyes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart meets Zahar hin the throne room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The heir is sitting in the throne.&nbsp;&nbsp; Guards are all over.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart is sitting at a table closer to the doors.&nbsp; Zahar still bows to the emperor, though he feels wierd about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all bow as well.&nbsp; (The heir is a dragonborn, reasonably young, about 8-10... definately not someone who'll be assuming the throne for like a decade or so.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart offers seats, we sit.&nbsp; <br /><br />"Regent Ironheart, I'm here primarily to allow you to know some of the members of the other factions you will be meeting at the council of factum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of most significant note are thsoe who lead the warlocks."&nbsp; He is very intrigued, and that of all the people who could be the ones most important for him to know about its the warlocks, he finds this very intriguing.&nbsp; Zahar&nbsp; mentions that their leader is the ebon priest, and his companion is the peacekeeper.&nbsp;&nbsp; ironheart is like "You're certain of this'?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar is like yes...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart asks why.<br />Zahar;&nbsp;&nbsp; "because he believes very much that he is doing bahamuts work and that the retaking of oraculum is of paramount importance.&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp; 'We will see about the first, but at this time we have no reason to contest the second.'&nbsp; "Much of the work he wants to do is to convert many of the soldiers away from the worship of asmodeus."&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart doesn't object... Zahar says that Asmodeus has been screwing with the empire...&nbsp;&nbsp; many times we have believed we were foolish in making the agreements we made...&nbsp; Ironheart is in favor of removing Asmodeus' control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says hte ebon priest offers the alternate path.&nbsp; Zahar says there's a crusade going on in the underdark to wrest control away form Asmodeus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart says that if ever there was a people who needed hope it would be them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will see if that is truly bahamuts will.&nbsp;&nbsp; veen if not, i doubt it will turn out poorly for them.&nbsp; Ironheart is thankful that we let him know.<br /><br />we also mention that from the hordes, the vanquisher will represent them.&nbsp;&nbsp; ironheart smiles and says "I can think of no chi9ef more suited ot the task.&nbsp;&nbsp; few others have success as he has... "&nbsp;&nbsp; ironheart didn't know but was just informed that Vanquisher also has a hatred of the demons.&nbsp; Also, the nomads will probably be represented, and Sidalfus at least, from delphia.&nbsp; Sahret will probably represent Fochlucan.&nbsp; Ironheart nods and says that that community will have significant information.&nbsp; When Ironheart says "so I am told," he's frustrated, as though he feels like a significant source of information has gone away.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask if Kasian is well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparentl he's still out and doing the work of his god with others doing the work of theirs.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar has a personal request.&nbsp;&nbsp; he wishes to seek and gather any reserve or off duty norns because they're trained for demonic threats and are used to protecting a nexus from them.&nbsp; <br /><br />"We could limit the number of norns protecting each nexus during a given shift, for a time...&nbsp;&nbsp; we would need additional soldiers to compensate for their loss."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says he believes if they deploy norns and allow Zahar to direct them that they will lose less soldiers overall.&nbsp; Ironheart is concerned that there won't be loss at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He says he'll communicate with the Norns to see if they can hold the nexuses with reduced forces.&nbsp; Says he'll try and get some of them into an elite force.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says he's uncertain of his position in the empire.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was given the position of outrider by marquis isaline...&nbsp;&nbsp; which doesn't stick very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart discerns lies and asks Zahar if he was properly appointed, it detects as not a lie.&nbsp;&nbsp; The emperor says that Zahar will now be recognized as an outrider now.&nbsp; Zahar says he'll continue to serve as best as he's able.&nbsp; <br /><br />we're dismissed. <br /><br />&nbsp;Darile scries eglarian.&nbsp;&nbsp; Messages to him. Introduces himself, is acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp; "We recieved, and I suspect you did as well that sending."&nbsp;&nbsp; He asks who is representing their tribe. Dermaythorn is going to.&nbsp; He is by far the more tactical of the two leaders.&nbsp; We also inform him that Ironheart will be representing the empire.&nbsp; Have heard the name...&nbsp; The vanquisher is representing the hordes possibly.&nbsp; He says that the vanquisher is likely.&nbsp; dariel is probably the only of the herion tribe.&nbsp;&nbsp; As close a representative to the outside as they've had in many years.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Also mentions individuals from underneath.&nbsp; It appears that two of the dead emperors are in charge of the current warlocks...&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't knwo fo them beforehand...&nbsp;&nbsp; Says it'll probably be most interesting...&nbsp; <br /><br />We mention that the fey aren't likeyl to come, except possibly Kith.&nbsp; But Kith is probably going to be representing hte vanquisher...<br /><br />Dariel mentions that Ironwood effects what Calenon was doing...&nbsp; This is news to the elder here.&nbsp;&nbsp; To all purposes, it seemed to negate the geomancy that Calenon had.&nbsp; Also lets him know that calenon is a dragon.&nbsp; An emerald dragon.&nbsp;&nbsp; We mention that the orbs changed hands.&nbsp; He says that herion and maybe all the tribes were supposed to be guarding what the nexuses were supposed to be and not what they are now.&nbsp; Elder mentions that there was a time (When they came forth from the wilds) that much knowledge was lost.&nbsp; The elder says he would like to speak with Calenon once this settled down.&nbsp; <br /><br />He says that Fochlucan was the first inverted nexus outside of the empire, and was the beginning of hte current calamity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elder says that he can commune with Dermithor tonight to notify him of what we've said.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jon says we can scry on people...&nbsp;&nbsp; they are all going to sending, going to the war council.&nbsp; for the sake of convenience, they won't have any unique info until the party combines.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel also let's zahar know that Calenon removed the one memory...&nbsp;&nbsp; as for the others, Asmodeus is still likely.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel managed to get a hold of vanquisher after 3 tries.&nbsp; Dariel sees the vanquisher at a meeting in a furred tent speaking to a serene looking goblin woman.&nbsp; Dariel casts message and whispers to Vanquisher.&nbsp; that they have met before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanquisher consdiers, loooks to the goblin and says "We are being scried. *Looks up*&nbsp;&nbsp; What is it you wish?" 'I wish to inform you of the other faction leaders... are you going to the meeting?' "I intend to, yes."&nbsp; Dariel mentions Ironheart of the empire, eglarian (the vanquisher is repeating this info tot he goblin), the plenipotentiaries, Dariel mentions himself as the representative of the herion tribe.&nbsp; Dariel mentions that the others whom the vanqusher met with Dariel nods.&nbsp; mentions probably not any fey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says the warlocks who no longer adhere to asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentiosn the ebon priest and an ally of his...&nbsp;&nbsp; the vanquisher mentions it to the goblin and she looks confused.&nbsp; Dariel explains that the ebon priest started a revolutipon against fiendgaze who was the leader of some of hte warlocks and is trying to get the warlocks to not follow asmodeus.&nbsp; Dariel mentions the Fochlucan... The vanquisher smiles when he mentiosn that.&nbsp;&nbsp; The vanquisher promises only himself, but says anothe rmight be joining him.&nbsp; Vanquisher says that the ordering is known to him...&nbsp; We say that the orderings have been stopped.&nbsp; Vanquisher is happy to know this.&nbsp; We say we'll meet him later.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel knows that the hordes have a kind of cooperative magic that others just don't have... some in particular are druids.&nbsp;&nbsp; The goblin woman he saw was almost certainly a druid high up in the wind tamer tribe.&nbsp; Dariel also said through the message directly to the druid "Greetings from a fellow druid" in druidic.&nbsp; <br /><br />We discuss ironwood.&nbsp; Ironheart is happy to send Elonna back to retrieve the gear that was there.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are still several full suits of ironwood that are repaired, and some weapons.&nbsp; One of them is a scimitar.&nbsp; <br /><br />I let the order of the common shield know the deal with bahamut/tiamat/Io.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed and I go to Factum relatively early.&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Skyline" is the tallest and highest quality in in town.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are given accomodations there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first to arrive is one of the representatives of the underdark.&nbsp;&nbsp; An acting magistrate who cam eot get the lay of the land "Daros Roll."&nbsp; he's a dark elf mage who wears a monocle.&nbsp; We three discuss maps and tactics.&nbsp; daros says that acting magistrate has been good for his career.&nbsp; Explains that when a nexus is inverted, first of all, the things in the tunnels go away, that lets them map the area.&nbsp; For reference, tehre's quitre a bit of space between the imperial regions where most of our region is and oraculum.&nbsp;&nbsp; We wouldn't be able to survive the trip... the ability to attack from underneath is low...&nbsp; <br /><br />We arrive at Factum, all.&nbsp; Daros says that Zahar has given Daros a great deal of luck.&nbsp; Daros says that Zahar has... lost weight.. or gained it...&nbsp;&nbsp; (Commenting on the fact that he's human.)&nbsp; Zahar introduces us.&nbsp; Daros is the magistrate of tateclenya.&nbsp; Daros knows he's seen him somewhere.&nbsp; Daros says the other magistrate won't be coming and is intrigued when we mention.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The people of the war council are fairly sure that the delphian gods are involved in this, and that Ioun himself (God of fate, among other things) may have sent the sending.&nbsp; <br /><br />The plenipotentiaries are also there already.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dermithor ios there as well.&nbsp; A couple of days after that, On day five, erinion shows up...&nbsp; One of the priestesses of Io.&nbsp; (The green/emerald one.)&nbsp; She is quartered as well.&nbsp; On day 6, we hear a rumor that the representative of the fey has arrived.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar meets with Erinion.&nbsp; When Zahar says hello, she is known as the patience of Io now.&nbsp; Zahar mentions he too has changed (of course.)&nbsp; They have acheived perfect balance. Zahar says that he would more easily accept the term&nbsp; tenuous...&nbsp;&nbsp; she says that it is how it is, basically.&nbsp; Zahar says he's basically who he was.&nbsp; She says that Zahar has a greater understanding of io than he would given himself credit for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar asks if humans and dragons are perhaps not so different.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that similar transformatiosn have occured over time...&nbsp;&nbsp; Io is a many faceted god who takes many forms, just as you have hte option of taking many forms.&nbsp;&nbsp; In a way, we aren't like the other races, are we?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />She says that they each have a unique capacity to change the way they are, yours as much as ours.&nbsp; Zahar suggests that they are pulled by the wor;d.&nbsp; and that perhaps everyone is, she says that no...&nbsp;&nbsp; just your kind and ours.&nbsp; Zahar says thats interesting, she agrees.&nbsp; Says its very difficult to get a handle on our places in this world.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that the nomads have a saying that the flow makes all things possible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says he has a goal to pursue now.&nbsp; But he still feels unsure where this journey is going.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that perhaps that is as it is intended...&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps if we knew where it ended the journey would be less interesting... perhaps even meaningless.&nbsp; She has had a chance to speak with the other aspects of io.&nbsp; Zahar asks if the eggs are safe.&nbsp;&nbsp; She seems to driof oput and says that those eggs are singular, and they are not here.&nbsp; If not for the means which Zahar obtained it, his humanity would be singular...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those from the hells are singular as well.&nbsp; Zahar is like so the answer to the egg question is yes or no... or sometimes...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says Yes to that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel speaks to the aspect of Io as well (She's on the second floor, BTW, we're on the 4th.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably,. she is dressed as a nomad.&nbsp; Dariel has heard of her name...&nbsp;&nbsp; people would seek her advice on things.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's more like a classical sense of a witch...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kinda a question answerer.&nbsp; She isn't really part of the nomadic tribes..&nbsp;&nbsp; they're the only people who come into contact with her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel introduces himse;lf.&nbsp;&nbsp; says "I did nmot know that your kind watched us so long.&nbsp;&nbsp; My kind watched all people of the world, we five have chosen peoples each and bore witness to their successes and failures. "&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dariel mentions Calenon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has heard the name and of his actions.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they keep themselves apprised of what's going on in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; she thinks about what's going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says some information has been given.&nbsp; Dariel mentions the oath Calenon made.&nbsp; Dariel asks about contact...&nbsp;&nbsp; says that every century or so, the dragons meet, introduce the younglings, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that she never remembers Calenon ever having gone there.&nbsp; She says the orb was reclaimed...&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel asks why Calenon tried to remove himself from the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; She thinks and replies that she is not best suited to answer that question.&nbsp; If Dariel wishes that answer, we would do well to contact the Aspect in the empire.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The red-&gt;now topaz.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel discusses Calenon being the same family as this aspect, and Dariel mentions that sometimes elder sought this aspects advice.&nbsp; Says its difficult for their kind to be born outside of it.<br /><br />Dariel says that he saw something when the new nexus occured...&nbsp;&nbsp; true balance of nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says its interesting he came to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; he says that their two families have been in contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that they enjoy the forest, it is more comfortable for them then anywehere else, btut he wilds are a close second as they are for most of us.&nbsp; Dariel says he was given info from Calenon that it may have been the duty of the nomads to protect the bnalanced nexuses that were&nbsp; just created...&nbsp;&nbsp; she says perhaps.&nbsp;&nbsp; He asks if memories take a while to return.&nbsp; She says that she doesn't remember much from mroe than 10000 years ago...&nbsp;&nbsp; she says there was a time that energy was not as it is now...&nbsp;&nbsp; calenon said it became tainted...&nbsp;&nbsp; she says it became different... not in balance, save in the one place.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says it is understandable that one of us might consider that a taint... we favor a balanced approach to existence, much as you nomads do.<br /><br />Dariel mentions that calenon taught him the teachings of balance.&nbsp; She says that she can't disagree that the nexuses have been polarized, no longer are what they once were.&nbsp; She says that she can't really help him because she's too close to Io and her perspective has been polarized, and it will take a while to return to 'normal'.&nbsp; <br /><br />Mordlwyn is the geomancer among the aspects.&nbsp; Apparently she's more attached to that form&nbsp; than most of us.&nbsp; <br /><br />dariel mentions that Asmodeus may have been effecting the flow, and that Calenon has done so.&nbsp;&nbsp; He suggests that Mowrlyn go to Tatenda to learn form calenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel brings up the ordering.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says its unlikely the ordering will lead to the hells.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; each time a world has been cut from the flow it has been one world.&nbsp; The ordering coalesces all worlds into one, which is different.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dariel mentions that the ironwood worked as a bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; she says that being condensed like that would be uncomfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel says he wants the dragon's perspective on it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Now ed and I go and see her.&nbsp; Ed asks what title to refer to her as, she says the patience of Io will work.&nbsp; Ed introduces himself with the full name.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is familiar Eridian also works, of course.&nbsp; <br /><br />ed asks how long she's been in the state she has been in.&nbsp; She says only a few days this last time...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the time prior to that.&nbsp; She says that the orb was given to dalia, who was in service to dragontamer.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says she was a chromatic for 4-5 centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second orb is in possession fo Asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; he is not pleased what has happened to the orb.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask what sway he has over them and their deity.&nbsp; Io is much more resilient to being compelled.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that she has travelled primarily with nomads but she's familiar with the delphians and the warfoprged.&nbsp;&nbsp; Few are built for social niceties in the forefront.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed says he's not sure what front he was made for, she says perhaps none.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says that has truth to it, says she knows more...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that some of them can see what others become.&nbsp; he says that she's seen what Simone has seen, she says yes, but its harder.&nbsp;&nbsp; Few warforged have variants, but you do.&nbsp;&nbsp; She susggests Ed has followed his path. She says she will pledge the support of Io.&nbsp; We ask about the nexus.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says its a familiar energy which existed many millenia ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; That it has occured again is a sign of the beginning or the end, and we are not sure which.&nbsp; <br /><br />She says she doesn't especially enjoy the accomodations but these are delphians, so they aren't quite so accustomed to nature so these will suffice.&nbsp; Ed offers his service.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note to self ask about the cranks and my memory blank.<br /><br />She says that she could see wher eothers of us have ended up.&nbsp; I ask about the blank memory of my period.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't know, but Simone or Mordwlyn might know..&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not unlikely she will be there.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may speak with her then, possibly, if your companion is unable.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The fey representative;&nbsp;&nbsp; woodsmands clothing, bow over her back, looks elvinish.&nbsp;&nbsp; She introduces herself as Ehlonna.&nbsp; Dariel goes in as she welcomes her.&nbsp; Dariel worships her (I'm going with dariel).&nbsp; she doesn't detect as evil.&nbsp; She says that they convened the courts and said that this is of critical importance.&nbsp; Says that a representative needed to be sent and she was volunteered.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna says normally the fey would be out of this, but other gods, whose ideals they do not agree with are involved, so they must act as well, towards a more proper course.&nbsp; dariel asks if htere's anything he can do for her, she says the accomodations are sufficient and all is well for the time being.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they intend to pledge forces.&nbsp; Dariel excuses himself awkwardly.&nbsp; <br /><br />She says some of the other gods interefered...&nbsp; Asmodeus has made things difficult for everyone. 'Weve already had to uintervene in a few spots where gods were involved...&nbsp; I'm not entirely sure of all of the details... I was not on the council that convened, but *looks at me and thinks*&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure you're aware of what I'm speaking of.&nbsp; You have been in the presence of another god...&nbsp;&nbsp; He was sent to find out if another god had meddled in places where we had not... unfortunately that did not prove as certain as we would have liked.&nbsp; And changing timelines is a very delicate matter.&nbsp; The flow makes things extremely complicated.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention the nexus of balance.&nbsp; I ask what made them become polarized, she's not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want you to understand something very important...&nbsp;&nbsp; garl might be upset if you knew, but the flow is not somethign within any of our total control.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would all like to think that we are absolute masters of what we do... but the flow is something that, though it doesn't touch us, we cannot determine where it goes, which is why its important asmodeus stop tampering with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one knows what the consquences would be...&nbsp;&nbsp; what we do know is if the nexuses were restored to teh original form they once had, that could be a good thing.&nbsp; It is possible it might be bad, too, but its impossible to know.&nbsp; <br /><br />The polarization happened many thousands of years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask if she suspects asmodeus' involvment in that.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's not certain.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they don't.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask the gods opinion on vance...&nbsp;&nbsp; mention he was aspiring to godhood.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says its hard to explain this to a warforged, but says Imagine there were threee of you...&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine pone became a devotee of garl, one simply served a function, and one reserved to necromancy...&nbsp;&nbsp; he would be no less your brother but you would not be happy for how things turned out for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance is much like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is one of us, but I don't like him.&nbsp; I ask who is currently serving in that position.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says the one we call vance has regained some of his divine power, and so has regained some of his portfolio, but the one called vecna does still have a great deal of that power.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask what she thinks of the Raven queens involvement,&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna was surprised, no one knew where she came from.&nbsp;&nbsp; She hid well, she wasn't supposed to do that.&nbsp; She says the raven queen just...&nbsp;&nbsp; was inactive..&nbsp;&nbsp; shes one of those that don't meet with the rest of us, we assumed she had some connection to Wee jas, who also does not meet with us.&nbsp; But she is...&nbsp;&nbsp; well, there are discussions going on... she wasn't supposed to use direct intervention (As she did in oraculum)... not that we like Grazzt, but we don't want to control peoples lives and want them to make their own choices, but if others of us are going to interfere...&nbsp; Ehlonna's in agreement, but Raven queen was naughty.&nbsp; It wasn't bad, just wrong.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Tharis dune was imprisoned by all of the gods.&nbsp;&nbsp; The quakes are him struggling against his bonds, and the nexuses are teh pitons of his chain.&nbsp; Also, mentioning his name is unwise.)<br /><br /><br />I ask about the chained god (Tharis dune).&nbsp;&nbsp; She clams up.&nbsp; I ask if the raven queen might have connections to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna smiles very slightly and says "There are rules we are willing to break by coming into this world, by talking to you and resolving this oraculum issue with the least harm to everyone, and i would like it to be understood what it means for us to break this edict and come forth and do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not something we would do lightly, something we normally wouldn't even consider.&nbsp;&nbsp; So when I tell you would be that asking me abotu the one that is chained would be problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp; She asks that I rescind the question, and I do.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says there is no greater threat to the world than the possibility that he could be released.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I don't simply mean the world, I mean us as well.&nbsp; I get the impression she doesn't know the full story but she knows enough to be worried.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone scries Zahar while we're still in alexandria...&nbsp;&nbsp; They are at Elyria at that point.&nbsp; Zahar is geomancied.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar knocks on the door and is let in.&nbsp; (Note, the devil lords imitation of Ehlonna.... didn't catch the sesne of primordial power that she did not.)<br /><br />(Note to self, ask abotu the sending.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar is nervous upon herarin the name Ehlonna.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that many events have been transpiring that should not be...&nbsp;&nbsp; says the protectiosn on the temple were not quite...&nbsp;&nbsp; as secure as they hoped.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says he was not expecting a representative of the fey, especially not one of the divine.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says she's one of the three who directly represents the fey...&nbsp; well, and there's obad-hai, but he is not so concerned witht eh fey directyl as he is with nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says the fey are foreign to him... he is humblingly ingnorant.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says don't worry about it... a servant of mine could educate you. (Implying Dariel).&nbsp; Zahar says most of what he's learned is from Kith...&nbsp;&nbsp; she looks very sad when he mentions Kith...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says she's not surprised he hasn't shared much of his origins... he's faced many difficulties.&nbsp; Zahar says Kith may surprise Ehlonna with the decisions kith has made recently, but Zahara is not in a position to presume.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna says nevertheless you came looking for me.&nbsp; Zahar says he wanted to knwo who he was meeting.&nbsp; <br /><br />ed knocks and enters.&nbsp; He recognizes her, but also recognizes she's different.&nbsp; She says that Ed has seen the plaque... and that's more in line than what he saw at the temple...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says there will be a reckoning for that.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that's not why she's here...&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says ed Is forthright, among other thigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says she finds hte young racxes to be fascinating, but delphian culture is not so concerned with social niceties as sutdy and results.&nbsp; As such i am becoming used to a less diplomatic approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed apologizes if he offended, he hasn't.&nbsp; Zahar says that if there's anything he's learned from his travels its that many of their values are not universal.&nbsp; Here we hope that some of them are, though.&nbsp;&nbsp; She seems to think that we'll agree that demons are bad, but from there, we'll see...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says there's hope of something greater, and there may be a conceit.<br /><br />Ed has another question:&nbsp; Ed asks why she's here instead of delegating. She says the task was delegated to her by the lords of the fey court, who are her parents (Ehlonna is supposadly the child of corellon and sehanine. who may well be oberon and titania.)&nbsp; <br />She says that unfortunately the others are a bit busy attending to other matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fey courts are in agreement that the demons are something to oppose so someone needed to come and represent our interests.<br /><br />Ed asks 2 more:&nbsp;&nbsp; A large contingent of fey forces attack terminus. (The platipods).&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that not everyone follows the same guidelines...&nbsp; Ed asks the rational behind the attack.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they're more servants of obad-hai, not mine, so She'd feel uncomfortable answering for them.&nbsp; But she says that creatures of the wild hate teh dark nexus in particular so they may come forward to deal with one.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that terminus has been returned to nature more than she had thought possible for a delphian city...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they reduced terminus to nothign in the space of a few days.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed's other question, which he's more hesitant to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp; He mentions the temple of sigil and its happenings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentions that Moradin's in ice, asks about others in conditions.&nbsp; She says only two gods have been compromised...&nbsp;&nbsp; Io and Moradin.&nbsp; The Io thing is that Asmpodeus has one of the orbs.&nbsp; Zahar says that Io doesn't displease him.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as far as moradin goes, he mentions that we're working on freeing him...&nbsp;&nbsp; says maybe we could seek aid from Ehlonna's council...&nbsp; She says "Asking for the assistance of a god to deal with another..."&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that opposing Asmodeus without all of the tools at your disposal would be unwise.&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, asking for the support is wise.&nbsp; Attempting to fight before you are ready is unwise, but with a foe like that, its very difficult to know when you will be ready.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar asks:&nbsp; I understand this isn't why you're here, but...&nbsp; I've heard ones perspective on the matter, but I'm interested in yours...&nbsp;&nbsp; About the continued existence of my people.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that humans have been extinct for a long time...&nbsp; she thought that the deva were created from the light nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; and the rakshasa their inversion.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they assumed this was an accident...&nbsp;&nbsp; says some even had deva or rakshasa as servants.&nbsp; But it seems that that assumption has been in error.&nbsp; Zahar asls if there's anything she intends to do about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; She thinks and says "I am not the most wise of gods nor the most wise...&nbsp; but I do not have a particular hatred for the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp; The conditions under which they became extinct could never happen."&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that humans were at one point too numerous that they tried to extinct everyone else.&nbsp; They died for it...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says there are no more too many.&nbsp; She says that Deva can't reproduce, but Rakshasa can.&nbsp; She says he knows of one such already.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says perhaps they should have been paying more attention... but she sees the result.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says he doesn't mind telling her that the few of his people If he can call them that (humans)... many of them bear great enmity for the gods...&nbsp; some due to an incomplete representation or bitterness...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that it was not an easy choice to make...&nbsp;&nbsp; most of us wouldn't even consider it...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says it wouldn't have happened if we hadn't had support...&nbsp;&nbsp; And she says that that too is a circumstance that cannot transpire again...&nbsp;&nbsp; She believes it can't, but says it maybe possibly could, but definately shouldn't.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says his slumber is distrubed more now than ever (chained god) and thats why the quakes are so violent.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says then it should be nom surprise that we have taken action here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says that a world with his power subverted to his will is what asmodeus seeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that the world...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahars heard this before, from...&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar doesn't say... says it makes no difference.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says in any case its far beyond mortal understanding...&nbsp; soemtimes perhaps beyond ours, i suspect due in large part to our brethren.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Why are humans singular? Maybe they're population is the flow or something...).&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna says that the strongest evil nongod controls something that hasn't been around in a few thousand years.&nbsp; Zahar finds her assurance that our safety is not guarenteed not very reassuring.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says perhaps it shoudl be sterange but no... perhaps we must accept responbsibiklity and sacrifice those we care about in order to achieve greater thigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a noble thing for one ot give their lives for the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar envies not their immortality...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they will succeed because they must.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says that that's a conceit but a helpful one.&nbsp; She says that perhaps her relative youth grants her some freedom.<br /><br />I ask about singular humans.&nbsp; She says its becaus ehte humans were never given time to adapt to teh flow, she doesn't really understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that just as the orbs of Io are singular, so are humans.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar is not because he has obntained that connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; he can retain the flow without keeping the form built in magic.&nbsp; Zahar says it is only by the fact of the balanced nexus he's a human now, she says he might have gotten there eventually anyway, possibly... though some would not have.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says he expects much of the reason humans can exist are singular...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who they followed aeons ago (The chained god.)&nbsp; when he was bound, it took something form us as well...&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps (The devas/rakshasas.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of them escaped and cut themselves off from the flow...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that perhaps he shared the same curse as others did...&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps by finding absolution for humans sins you find the ability to reenter the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says maybe it was just adaptiation, he's not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says he's the one who speaks of enlightenment, he says as an ideal, she says its realized... but then the cannot profess to fully understand these thigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says if he is enlightened... not to diminish it, but I am somehow disappointed... I thought I would know what to do... conversly, if my ancestors had succeeded,....&nbsp; this may overstep myself...&nbsp; this is somewhat personal...&nbsp; May I speak with you privately ...&nbsp;&nbsp; ( allow him)<br /><br />He says that if his ancestors succeeded in their goals, they probably would have been disappointed as well...&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what its like to be a god but i suspect it does not absolve you of the difficulty of your decisions and give (basically o=mnisience)...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says if it had, she'd be disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says that though the scope is wider, its much the same, perhaps, she agrees...<br /><br />She says she was one of the first who took up woodcraft so seriously, but simply because... and I do not say this with particular hubris...&nbsp;&nbsp; that I am the best, does not mean that I have all the answers, merely that I have achieved somethign significant, though the road has not ended.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says that in some small way it has ended.&nbsp; Zahar says its good to know that even the gods hope and dream and fear...&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn't shake his faith as he once thought it would.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that some gods don't hoipe, or dream, or fear, but she thinks they're missing out.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We reenter.&nbsp; I ask about the sending.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says it was ioun.&nbsp;&nbsp; he's been working on a few things.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed says hopefully he can help keep order...&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughs and says that's not why they're here.&nbsp; She says if We wanted a sobering godly presence we''d have pelor instead, but he's busy.&nbsp; <br /><br />We leave.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says human history...&nbsp;&nbsp; humans tried to get divinity...&nbsp;&nbsp; They had support of their god.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's the one who is chained.&nbsp; He is the one whose prison is maintained by the tower...&nbsp;&nbsp; (The tomb of the betrayer, remember, it was called.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says the nexuses are poitns where the chains are held fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the quakes are reality changing as he thrashes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of his people were killed by the other races.&nbsp; <br /><br />We see someone else heading towards teh inn... about 7 feet tall, human, he is incredibly muscular, wearing basic clothing.&nbsp; Zahar greets him, he stops and responds.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar introduces himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord introduces himself.&nbsp; He has a feeling of raw power... its totally not the one we saw in the temple... this one is faaaar less restrained.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says he didn't expect so many gods to be represented.&nbsp;&nbsp; kord says he'll be there at the fight.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says many of the gods bear the countenance of their patron people...&nbsp;&nbsp; poitns out that many of the gods appear human.&nbsp; Kord puts on a grin.&nbsp; "Yeah, funny how that works, huh?"&nbsp; Zahar asks if its a coincidence or a mystery he's not yet to know... Kord says neither in particular..&nbsp;&nbsp; kord says most of the time is about where they come from.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask where he comes ffrom, Kord says you're definately not from back then or you'd have withered...&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose we're not from the same stock then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says he was probabyl a human back when...&nbsp; Zahar says he looks forward to fighting beside him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar and all of us know that.&nbsp; We go back... I pray devoutly.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel lets the council know that Ehlonna showed up.&nbsp; They don't fault him for not talking to her much.&nbsp;&nbsp; He asks if there's anmything else to tell her on their behalf, they're like... no...&nbsp; Dariel says that he also met The Patience of Io.&nbsp; They're also happy at that.<br /><br />Zahar sending messages to two people...&nbsp;&nbsp; Including people in the troll, ann, cleric of theris dune adventuring party.<br /><br />Kord was not on the list of delegates.&nbsp; <br /><br />Factum is more of a technological city.&nbsp; <br /><br />I put on a performance in Skyline.&nbsp; Most of the other performers are warforged, as Zahar sees.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar gets back at like 3ish...&nbsp; <br /><br />I see nothing.&nbsp; Something happens in Ed's room.&nbsp; She steps into the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows exactly what this is and he drops ot one knee.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says there are some problems and he should hurry and run and get out of town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says to get out of town and not come back.&nbsp; Zahar and dariel hear the conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel&nbsp; sends his owl to Ehlonna and walks into the hallway.&nbsp; Dariels<br /><br />At this point, there is an earthquake.&nbsp; An actual one.&nbsp; while we're doing all this...&nbsp;&nbsp; Haft rounds the corner and seems uninhibted by the ground shaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's floating off the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A chrome plated warforged with a cigar in his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; A hat bolted to his head and an actual duster.&nbsp; There is a cloud of smoke that exhales into the area infront of him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stops, looks at the two of them, holds out bnoth hands and shoots gouts of flame along the hallway.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar asks who the hell this guy is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar notices that the little things on his arms glow green a bit.&nbsp; (heh... haft has a green weapon.)&nbsp; <br /><br />There are tears in the city from the earthquake.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed walks out of his room with Haft's old cigar and greater vital strikes the fucker.&nbsp; <br /><br />dariel detects something unusual.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a fucking robot ninja... he's only visible for a split second.&nbsp;&nbsp; They hear glass shards hitting the floor, but he himself is unheard.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel's owl reports that there are two flying things approaching the building.&nbsp; <br /><br />We all hear clearly...&nbsp; The earthquake subsides, and there's another rumbling and everythiong seems to lift...&nbsp;&nbsp; The owl reports that the city is moving.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, Haft... we can't really tell if he's winded or not...&nbsp;&nbsp; but we'll be able to tell when he's taking wounds.&nbsp; <br /><br />I use amplify to negate silence!&nbsp;&nbsp; And resume singing, only BETTER NOW! (From inspirational boost).&nbsp; He is no longer ethereal.&nbsp; My fortification blocks teh sneak attack!&nbsp; Also, I get to make a fort save!&nbsp;&nbsp; (It was 51)&nbsp; I passed.&nbsp; This is theta...&nbsp;&nbsp; also, one of Ed's eidolons.&nbsp; They cannibalized alpha for spare parts.&nbsp; <br /><br />Whirling blades..&nbsp; flying machines with a pair of flying gnomes.&nbsp;&nbsp; They open gatling guns on us.&nbsp; Ed and Zahar dodge out of the fire, and a cannon ball hits me.<br /><br />Dariel&nbsp; is whirlwinding and flys into one of the choppers the gnome is riding.&nbsp; The gnome is like Ahh!&nbsp; <br /><br />Theta HiPS again. <br /><br />Parts of the city are sagging down where its cracked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord comes running out... we hear war drums start up.&nbsp; Kord says "They are not ruinging my peace talks!"&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulls out a pair of greatswords and dives into one of the rifts. <br /><br /><br />(Rememebr the city is floating, so the rifts lead to below the ground.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />hehe... I D-Door into a cockpit with wrin and say to surrender!&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar&nbsp; =is hit by oil jets which then burn.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Gnome self destructs the ship and teleports defensively.&nbsp; I'm a bit vitality damaged from the ship exploding with me inside it. <br /><br />The bloody thunder tribe is here...<br /><br />A woman riding a horse goes down intot he chasms as well<br /><br />Zahar is 0on a helicopter, on fire, punching through a cockpit with glowy awesome.&nbsp; And then snap kicks the Gnome in the face after punching through the cockpit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Theta full attacks Ed.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar is rammed between the building and the wall.&nbsp; But zaha Jumps out of the way&nbsp; back into the building.&nbsp; Then Fire Shoryukens The chopper by launching himself out the window at it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note, he's still on fire.&nbsp; The gnome ejects (Aka casts teleport)...&nbsp;&nbsp; He looks horrified...&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar tears off a chunk of the machine..&nbsp; and the ship explodes.&nbsp; He evades it and he feather falls to the ground.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed owns the shit out of Theta<br /><br />A strange bluish glow occurs ... and ed Shuts down as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's shut down.&nbsp; HIs last words as this happens...&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dibs on the cigar."&nbsp; <br /><br />In another reality is the other battle.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Blue group)<br /><br />I join in As I feel some quake vertigo and I jump down with feather fall.&nbsp; I now here Sahret Singing as I fall down...&nbsp;&nbsp; he hears me...&nbsp; <br /><br />The Grig says "You'll rue this day..."&nbsp;&nbsp; And he teleports away with a supernatural ability and teleports away.&nbsp; someone flies down and casts a spell on the person Admatha was getting ready to wither to death...&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says to the priestess:&nbsp;&nbsp; You shouldn't have revealed yourself; that was an amateur mistake.&nbsp; <br />The priestess who healed the person with the reach cure is torn a new one by Barnabas.&nbsp; Barnabas suddenly feels a sharp sudden pain strike his body.&nbsp; Someone shared pain to him and then coup de graced himself...&nbsp;&nbsp; Barnabas dies (Yeah... a DC 83 Fort save is not likely.).&nbsp;&nbsp; And he drops the priestess.&nbsp;&nbsp; And its simone's turn.&nbsp; <br />The crystal dragon tries to heal Barnabas from a range...&nbsp; barnabas's wounds close but he doesn't come back to life, and the Dragon is like "I can't do more without a nexus."<br /><br />Adnatga walks up to her and starts to wither her and says "She's mine..."&nbsp; Admatha drains her like immediately as Nerull helps her and gives her her divine intervention back since he's very pleased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />barnabas is raise dby St. Cuthbert's will.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cuthbert accepts this decision, but he brings him back anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its soemthing specifically about barnabas.&nbsp; In words, kinda like...&nbsp; "i'll grant this, but...&nbsp;&nbsp; take care."&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar talks to Sahret about the rings... mentions the sword bearer had one...&nbsp;&nbsp; he got the wife the information.&nbsp; Admatha probably puts the withered person into her robe and the portable hole gets her other enemy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Adsmatha feels extremely fatigued from The gods touch through her body.&nbsp; <br /><br />So...&nbsp; why is the city flying?&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna was probably a target of that evil grig.&nbsp; Ehlonna comes outside...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith&nbsp; calls her my lady.&nbsp; She says she's unharmed...&nbsp;&nbsp; she was prepared in her room for the attackers when she heard the noise.&nbsp; She says ioun warned her of the threat in advance and percieved it posed a real danger. <br /><br />There's an army of hordes...&nbsp;&nbsp; getting plastered..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These guys are the bloody thunder tribe.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna says its more dangerous on the ground...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe artemis activated the city early as a defense...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith shows concern to her.&nbsp; Ehlonna does a group revitalize effect...&nbsp;&nbsp; It winded her byut it slightly vitalizes all of us.&nbsp; <br /><br />The vanquisher's tribe is the flayed skulls.&nbsp; 5 other tribes were used on the lineship assault.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask if Dares Roll is still here.&nbsp; Admatha says she'd like to know where he is... *With a malicious smile...&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp; he'd probably like to know what happened to his mistress.&nbsp;&nbsp; A number of gnonmes arrive with long rods with like meetal detector sorts of things, and they're slowly regenerating the rend with it.&nbsp; They clean up.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tell admatha about Ed shutting down.&nbsp; And thatr Dariel is lookiong after it.&nbsp; I mention that I was probably quaked.&nbsp; We clear the palce out pretty quick.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br /></p>
