      <p><br />6/18/2010<br /><br />What happened to Biger.&nbsp; I feel myself lose consciousness and awaken in a cluttered rioom filled with gadgets and bubbling concoctions everywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm on a lab table without Wrin.&nbsp; First thing I see is a gnomish face, peeking at me, leaning over me.&nbsp; I notice that at least two of my panels are open and he's picking around in them.&nbsp; I feel a dull ache in my back like someone's been mucking around back there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gnome reaches up and puts his goggles on his forehead<br /><br />It was not meant to be turned more than once.&nbsp; <br /><br />He says this is his workshop.&nbsp; This is Garl.&nbsp; He wants me to know I'm doing werll...&nbsp;&nbsp; and <br /><br />I knocked those avatars out for a year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Garls been tlaking to me through Wrin.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its his way of being cautious when speaking with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He can circumvent , say, Vecna's mastery of secrets by talking through Wrin.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other crank was not meant to be activated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a failsafe system.&nbsp;&nbsp; he's now deactivated.&nbsp; He says everyone is corruptable...&nbsp;&nbsp; So the other crank port was designed to be used in that emergency.&nbsp; <br /><br />It may have been an even more devastating...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but all of your eidolons would have disappeared forever.&nbsp; <br /><br />My original crank was something of which I am much more proud..&nbsp;&nbsp; For some time i've been hoping to exploit a hole... a backdoor into the prison.&nbsp; The Prison.&nbsp;&nbsp; THose other gods thought it'd be a good idea to create the prison...&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems they didn't have much choice.&nbsp; Its not something he's real proud of but the world would be different.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Garl thought maybe not make it permanent....&nbsp;&nbsp; So he kinda put in a backdoor, to reach Tharis dune's mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; So My system is the conneciton.&nbsp;&nbsp; Destiny is what Tharis dune is, and by turning hte crank, I was manipulating destiny.<br /><br />Each nexus is a link in the chain that binds him, byut too many might be bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned that a nexus is bad.&nbsp; <br /><br />The wash of positive energy twisted Avandra and Kord and Avandra.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kord will be angry....&nbsp;&nbsp; Garl doesn't trust a Kord filled with Tharis dune's madness.&nbsp; Oh, and Garl doesn't <br /><br />He says he fixed up me and wrin.&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul is intact, but it would be best to disable the crank, so he did so...&nbsp;&nbsp; the mechanism's all burnedo ut anyway and would take a lot longer to fix, so he didn't, because He wants his interests represented in this battle.&nbsp; <br /><br />He finishes, slams me shut.&nbsp; My items and injuries are recharged.&nbsp; <br /><br />He says he augmented me a bit.&nbsp; (Aka I hit level 17).&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask him about Tharis dune.&nbsp;&nbsp; most of the gods don't know what to make of him.&nbsp;&nbsp; he made us;.... but he's totally crazy now.&nbsp; He says not to think of Tharis as a person.&nbsp;&nbsp; What made Tharis crazy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably being bound in the prison for so long.&nbsp; <br /><br />The nexuses probably fell out of alignment because he became mad.&nbsp; There's been some theorizing that if you restored more nexuses, you might be able to help him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Garl says that neither hte devils nor demons have anything good planned for this world, and stopping them is somethign everyone can agrtee on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just watch out for those that serve the devils.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask Garl about Admatha and Nerull.&nbsp; e says Nerull is one of thos emystery gods... just showed up...&nbsp;&nbsp; was chatting with boccob one day... he thought Nerull might just have beena&nbsp; spontaneously generated form from mortal condition...&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't buy it and I don't think he really does either.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think Nerull... well, ok...&nbsp;&nbsp; there are gods like Avandra...&nbsp;&nbsp; she attained godhood....&nbsp;&nbsp; That's not true for nerull.&nbsp; <br /><br />He has a suspicion that we'll all find out soon what Nerull's up to... thigns seem to be coming to a head.&nbsp; <br /><br />We say our goodbyes, and he sends me back to the battle.<br /><br />(Note to self, have Biger go on a pilgramage to the first place his crank was turned.)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Action points:&nbsp;&nbsp; If fighting alone:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gain +1 defense for the turn.&nbsp; Gain +1 maneuver for the turn, or +2 to attack for the turn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The special powers.<br /><br />Arwel:&nbsp;&nbsp; Vengeful strike:&nbsp;&nbsp; Can assign an amount of damage, = to the # of injuries instead of attacking.&nbsp; Remember, gotta declare it in advance.<br /><br />Isaline:&nbsp;&nbsp; Egregious charge.&nbsp;&nbsp; When fighting on her own if she destroys a rank 1, can destroy a target adjacent until she runs out of successes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith:&nbsp; balanced precision.&nbsp;&nbsp; if fighting on a balanced ley line, gets an additional success whenever he scores at least on success on a target.&nbsp;&nbsp; (When fighting alone only.)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />The platipods activate their claw things.&nbsp; Kith buffs them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vashir gets ready to use his explode.&nbsp; He pops really hard on Gruumsh, a lot of nearby guys dom too.&nbsp; Gruumsh mounts a feeble counterattack...&nbsp;&nbsp; Gruumsh Is doing fine, but then Vashir punches him in the face with negative nexus energy, moving faster than he possibly could.&nbsp; Gruumsh is more concerned by this than ebverything else combined.<br /><br />Joe unleashes a stream of the negative energy to cancel out the pseudonaturalness of Avandra,&nbsp;&nbsp; The tentacles that had sprouted out are put into remissed...&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe and Avandra are back in action.&nbsp; She drops to one knee and is breathing heavily.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another city appears; it's solicitus.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just above the place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vashir finishes off Gruumsh by burning like all the his energy.&nbsp; Gruumsh's avatar lets off a howl and vanishes.&nbsp; <br /><br />We breach the walls.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a demonic structure there... we kool-aid through the wall.&nbsp; I share Smite with everyone.&nbsp; One of the heads takes one look "Goddamn prophecy...&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe its you, you sonovabitch."&nbsp;&nbsp; The other says to Kas"&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have known you would be here... you who are like me..."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />I share smite, Zahar gives the 10000 year punch speech.&nbsp; He calls upon all of the power of the balanced nexus.&nbsp; It dries up the nexus.&nbsp;&nbsp; It scatters demogorgon and dissipates him entirely.&nbsp; (Dried up for the day.)&nbsp;&nbsp; No one has ever managed to tap out a nexus permanently.&nbsp; <br /><br />Clearly, Demogorgon was exerting control.&nbsp;&nbsp; The demons fall into chaos and are pretty easily defeated after that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Joseph manages to finish recovering Kord's positive overload.<br /><br />Images flash before simone:&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a massive un leashing of energy...&nbsp; she sees visions or fragments thereof that she's seen before...&nbsp; The image of the person at teh temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; She sees a similar scene, biut with two of the person (This is visible about demogorgon... somehow, Simione knows this to be critical to this situation.&nbsp; She also sees Zahar in his human form standing next to that woman in battle against dwarves and elves.&nbsp; Moradin is in the distance, arrayed against them.&nbsp; That's over Zahar's head.<br /><br />One more vision as Demogorgon fades... Very brief, a confrontation between she and zahar.&nbsp;&nbsp; she seems more feral, more like the people she's seen who ar epractitioners of the hell fist.&nbsp;&nbsp; They argue...&nbsp;&nbsp; she looks angry as she leaves, and he looks thoughtful as he leaves.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas claps Zahar on the shoulder.&nbsp; Vhaerun<br /><br />The nexus returns after three days.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Over the next few mnonths, they research the nexus.&nbsp; one thing that is discovered, is that Ed, though he's disabled, they manage to tap into the map in his mind.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says it'll be possible to reactivate him but it'll take time.<br /><br />They study the nexus use the map as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; They notice something strange. over time.&nbsp;&nbsp; They notice the appearance of what are a few new nexuses in the wastes.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're new and fairly weak.&nbsp; There are several very small very clumped nexuses.&nbsp; <br /><br />People want to recruit people and find out what's going on with that.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>

      <p>The demons kept pouring out of Oraculum. Wave after wave after wave. I have to admit that fighting on my own was exhilarating. But I'm not built for this. Time to join another unit and try my hand at leading. The geomancers are behind me, but the echinochs have just joined the field. I miss then, and I'd love to see them in action. I helped them cover the backs of the platopods. We took out a few demon units while the platopds tore down the wall.<br /><br />We fought our way into the city, and then into Demogorgons lair. Many of those who I had traveled with managed to gather inside the lair. Za'har took center stage. He gathered power reaching back ten thousand years and struck a killing blow.<br /><br />In that moment, visions were released. Za'har and Demogorgon have fought together before. They had both opposed the Moradin and the extinction of the humans. I didn't know Za'har was old enough to be a part of that battle. I wonder if the other humans with us were as well?<br /><br />But the more interesting part is Demogorgon. He/she/it/they/whatever is someone I had seen before. In the images from Sigil, there was a woman who flew to the top of the tower, became two, and then collapsed the tower as the ring fell. This woman was Demogorgon, or became Demogorgon, or.. ? I'm not sure exactly who she was, or how one becomes a demon, let alone one so powerful. There must be quite a story there.<br /><br />Maybe I can get something from Za'Har. Beyond that, the road leads back to Sigil.</p>

      <p>Well the battle has been hard and brutal, but the city has been retaken.&nbsp; No matter the cost it was necessary to push out Demogorgon from the balanced nexus.&nbsp; However as I survey the ruined city and the alliance's troops a dark thought stirs.&nbsp; What is it about this nexus and the gods that trouble me so?&nbsp; For how much interest some have had in what we do, why did only a few turn up on either side?&nbsp; I just do not know what Gruumsh and the others arrived and what their aim was.</p><p>I think it is time to leave behind the petty struggles of the Imperials and the Delphians.&nbsp; Kazian is good enough to take my place, in all realities as far as I can care.&nbsp; My family, the Unnamed, and all the rest can wait for the time being.&nbsp; I am going to take a trip through shadows and seize something that should not be left behind.&nbsp; Perhaps this is what she intended, but I will not be an unwitting tool until I know more.</p>
