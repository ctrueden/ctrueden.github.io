      <p><br />(The sequestering HP feat:&nbsp;&nbsp; basically a seperate 'reserve pool'.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a cap of +2x character level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't easily change the size of the pool.&nbsp;&nbsp; It <br /><br />fills up only after my vit is full...&nbsp; It's like a spellpool that can be used for nonspells.&nbsp; -p0p;<br /><br />Blue group.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question thing.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Allen's question: "How can I break the gray warlock pacts... is killing Asmodeus the best way, and if so, how to do that..." (a gray warlock).&nbsp; [<br /><br />Arwel was helping buiuld Tatenda Nos.&nbsp; She feels herself drifting out of her normal dreams...&nbsp; in that dream she's in glorious battle, storming enemy <br /><br />territory... can tell she's in hell, but this place is even more intense.&nbsp; The deepest pit of hell...&nbsp; She senses other halpers bu its not really about her. <br /><br />&nbsp;She hears herself call out 'For Tudor!"&nbsp;&nbsp; And charges intoa&nbsp; big structure of stone... its the great infernal library.&nbsp;&nbsp; As she charges in there are som <br /><br />devil servents that she takes down.&nbsp; She finds herself chargin deeper and deeper in, has to leave sebastian behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds contract after contract that has <br /><br />been filed... and she searches, and she sees it and knows its Tudors contract... and she takes it and she unleashes her fury on it.&nbsp; Breaths flames on the <br /><br />book... like a flamestrike breath.&nbsp; And she feels exultation at having destroyed the binding... and as she's ready to turn around and leave, she feels the <br /><br />room darken and says "you would dare to steal my property?"&nbsp;&nbsp; and around her there's a 13 foot tall demon and she knows its asmodeus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'll pay for your <br /><br />crimes, you bitch!" and its cuthbert talking through Arwel.<br /><br />A bit shaken...&nbsp;&nbsp; because yeah, in the dream she was fearless, but she realizes the magnitude of the situation.&nbsp; she was in<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Paul's question: "How can the world be set back to its natural state." Asked of Mlora.&nbsp; Kith's opinion of natural state:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; how it was before he started <br /><br />serving Grazzt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&nbsp; Breaks off from 'the big V' (Vance?), does so on pleasant terms.&nbsp; <br /><br />In his dream, he is not himself.feels he's someone else form long ago.&nbsp; finds himself standing amongst a congregation of the gods. A conclave...&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees <br /><br />them all seated arounda&nbsp; large table and he's seated there as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees 21 gods... recognizes all the gods of old.&nbsp; And he hears pelor (Who looks as <br /><br />ancient as he did... but mayeb a bit younger in the dream.)&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Enough of this; let us bring this to a vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; All those in favor of Tharis Dune's <br /><br />imprisonment.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith feels&nbsp; a sorrow...&nbsp; like its unfortunate it had to come to this.&nbsp;&nbsp; its unanimous, except for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he hears his feminine voice <br /><br />and it says "I can never support this.&nbsp;&nbsp; There must be another way.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can find another way."&nbsp;&nbsp; Pelor says 'It is decided.' kith stands up and walks away <br /><br />filled with fury, not saying another word.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Scene changes:&nbsp;&nbsp; He feels wetness on his cheeks as it rolls down...&nbsp;&nbsp; its outdoors in this clearing, and sees in the distance the other gods bring a man <br /><br />(tharis dune) forward chained in shackles.&nbsp; He's kinda standing there resignedly, as though he's got an inner peace...&nbsp;&nbsp; he's a very calm composed guy by <br /><br />his nature, for sure, Kith feels.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sees as two of the gods step forward and hold his arms, Erythnul and Gruumsh step forward and each take one of his arms. <br /><br />&nbsp;the other gods each take positions,a nd Corellon stands ready to fight in case somethings going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; And kord drags with both arms an enormous chain as <br /><br />big as he is up to the man...&nbsp;&nbsp; kord looks sad, and even form this distance can be heard "Sorry, dad."&nbsp;&nbsp; And he starts winding the chain around, and the <br /><br />gods each lay their hands on the chain and infuse their power.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in exchange, a portion of one of the large links shrinks into a small link and attaches <br /><br />to the god.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Sensation of time passing in the dream.&nbsp; Kith senses he's still Mlora.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing in the woods, but the trees are dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaves are gone, the branches <br /><br />becoming brittle and dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cradles in his hand a dead pixie... feels furious once again and knows that this is a consequence of what they had done.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />transports himself to the only god who might know what to do about this.&nbsp; Boccob, is writing on the desk...&nbsp;&nbsp; Senses Deja Vu...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiths seen some of this <br /><br />before, but this is more detailed.&nbsp; In the dream Kith says "Soory to distrub you, but have you seen the area opposite the temple?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land is drying <br /><br />up... is threr nothing that can be done."&nbsp;&nbsp; Boccob Looks up and has an air of distance.&nbsp; "Unfortunately, the situation cannot be changed..."&nbsp;&nbsp; eye gleams, <br /><br />he uses the chain link, lady of pain appears.&nbsp;&nbsp; boccob gestures lazily, but there's a hunger in his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; She lashes out with the chains and lashes out at <br /><br />Kith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolute complete agony, and for a moment knows her pain as she kills him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boccob stretches out his hand straining to absorb mlora's essence, but <br /><br />kith scatters reflexively in all directions, and Kith feels foils him, and the dream fades because who he was not longer truly is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith wakes up in a cold sweat and feels her presence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mlora is with him now... what remains of her is in the sword... its a small shadow of who she was, <br /><br />but he can hear her voice in his mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; says "now you have seen teh devastation caused to the land by what they did.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to restore it it must be <br /><br />undone... it must be freed."&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't saying it like a yearning, but rather as a matter of truth.&nbsp; There's the impression that its a choice.&nbsp; Then <br /><br />feels her essence leave, as though it was a big strain.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Those of us who were in the pits...&nbsp; have the fugue memories of having arrived there... and then...&nbsp;&nbsp; what?&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened?&nbsp;&nbsp; did we win?&nbsp;&nbsp; has it happened <br /><br />yet?&nbsp;&nbsp; oh geez.<br /><br />Kith flies up.&nbsp; gets a bit dizzy...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suddenly notices a thing.&nbsp; <br />Kith tries to scry Simone...&nbsp;&nbsp; then can kinda tell that simone's ring is no longer like <br /><br />active... so she's either not wearing it or has been killed.&nbsp; <br />*<br />Kith then goes to the lyrist faction territory.&nbsp; Kith says he wants to speak with the odious dragonborn...&nbsp;&nbsp; says he believes the dragonborn is with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The guys he asks says you mean... Arwel *surname*.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't really live here... last I heard she was trying to relocate her family here.&nbsp; She's <br /><br />typically with the other independents... *gives directions.*&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith knocks on the door and Arwel answers...&nbsp;&nbsp; offers some meat...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arwel talks about her strange dream.&nbsp; Kith says that that's not unusual, and arwels <br /><br />says yeah,,, but its totaly vivid!&nbsp; Kith asks if Arwel saw Simone.&nbsp; Arwel says that Simone hasn't responded.&nbsp; Kith says that Arwel could help with something <br /><br />since she's tall and strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arwel asks the task.&nbsp; Kith says he needs to save the world.... arwel asks how.&nbsp; She asks the rough version.&nbsp; Kith mentions <br /><br />the rings, Arwel indicates her fochlucan ring, they test them out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith manages to catch something from Arwel, but it was gibberish.&nbsp; Arwel asks what <br /><br />Kith's ring is...&nbsp;&nbsp; kith says it was a precursor ring...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith said that some thought it was a better idea to imprison a god than destroy her.&nbsp; Kith feels <br /><br />the sword kinda pulsing and calling to him as this scenario happens.&nbsp; kiths mind feels slkightly amplified while he holds the hilt.&nbsp; Kith says he would <br /><br />prefer for it to be mroe than just two.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says that they're going to free Arwel and save the world.&nbsp; "Tatenda will be your last chance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go now or she will be forever lost."&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says he returned an interesting message.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was in the ashes of a burnt offering at an alter he found somewhere in the area of oraculum.&nbsp; Kith repeats <br /><br />the message just above.&nbsp; Kith says that the message was written in the remnants of a burnt offering...&nbsp;&nbsp; he didn't know to whom the shrine was.&nbsp; Kith draws <br /><br />the burnt offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith uses illusion and generates the image of the shrine... a rotten piece of fruit that was then burned, and a small wicker doll.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />the wicker doll had no mouth but had little eyes it had fashioned.&nbsp; Arwel thinks that it looks like maybe someone who possibly has domain over fire and <br /><br />death.&nbsp; like... death comes to all things.<br /><br />Kith's like i'm bringing you for your arm.&nbsp; Kith says he cannot lose his last chance to restore her.&nbsp; Zahar and I meet up.&nbsp; We go to Arwel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone sees us <br /><br />approaching and remains hidden.&nbsp;&nbsp; we let ourselves in with Kith there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel asks why zahar is glowing.&nbsp; Kith says he's afraid we may be at cross purposes.&nbsp; Kith asks if...&nbsp; zahar works for pelor.&nbsp; <br /><br />simone comes in.&nbsp; Kith totally hits on that really hot nymph.&nbsp; (Simone introduces herself as milay).&nbsp; Zahar and I vouch for Simone.&nbsp; And Simone's Identity <br /><br />is revealed to arwel.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; kith and Simone go off to speak.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Simone's ring lets her sink out of phase and become invisible to the others.&nbsp; <br /><br />We consider if its safe to discuss here.&nbsp; We're pretty sure it is.<br /><br />We talk about the rings being dangerous.&nbsp; We mention the guild...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith says they're hte wielders of the Mlora...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith says he can't guess how long ago, <br /><br />but Mlora was attacked by the lady of chains, and whoever was masquerading as Boccob... we mention that the Vacob situation is messy...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith says Mlora <br /><br />was attacked by him, and she scattered herself.. the guild has corrupted her purpose...&nbsp;&nbsp; and Kith hoped they would change their ways, but its becomie more <br /><br />clear they haven't, and with a message he recently recieved.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith mentiosn the shrine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar gets a 50 know religion... when someone tries to remove the shrines, they'er damaged....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're shrines to Wee Jas.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says he served mlora in his youth.&nbsp; Kith says he betrayed her for glory, money, valor, pride.&nbsp; He says he paid, for thousands and thousands of years, <br /><br />for that crime.&nbsp; And Kith things he'll never be able to wipe the stain away but he's not here to give a confession.&nbsp; When he came back and finally won <br /><br />free...&nbsp;&nbsp; when he was set free, the world was different, and Mlora was dead, gone, lost to time.&nbsp; no one knows her except for htese guild members.&nbsp;&nbsp; And <br /><br />they've perverted her purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask what her purpose was:&nbsp;&nbsp; its beauty, life, etc.<br /><br />kith mentions in his vision what happened to her.&nbsp; When Tharis dune was being imprisoned....&nbsp;&nbsp; *Kith describes the scene... 21 deities.*&nbsp; Mlora dissented... <br /><br />&nbsp; and when Boccob was confronted, he ordered the lady of pain to take Mlora.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith mentions theres no flow on the plains.&nbsp; He mentions the abyss.&nbsp; We're like the hells... and they're flowless because Asmodeus wins...&nbsp;&nbsp; zahar says that <br /><br />in celestia the balanced nexus and Shyle's vigilance keep them in check.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar mentiosn the other two wardens names.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith plans to restore Mlora.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith ppulls out the sword says there's more and its his shame.&nbsp;&nbsp; he confesses to slaying the emperor.&nbsp;&nbsp; he says that when he did it there was probably just <br /><br />hte one one... and its this blade that holds a small measure of Mlora.&nbsp; And it can draw the others from her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar asks if kith knows how it was forged.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says he knows Kas did.&nbsp; <br /><br />We say that Kas is an Aspect of Kiransely, just like Asmodeus, demogorgon and the Raven Queen.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says he knew her once.&nbsp; From before the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew her as Tharis dunes left hand... and says that Zahar was his right as Vhaerun.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith asks <br /><br />where Zahar was when the gods chose to chain him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says he was hunted and destroyed with the rest of his people, where Tharis dune told them to go, <br /><br />for he submitted himself to save them.&nbsp;&nbsp; despite this, Zahar says he still doesn't think killing the gods is the right answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith asks that he <br /><br />understands that the goal of the guild is to kill teh 20 gods who wronged melora.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vengeance was never in her... they're using her power to subvert and <br /><br />corrupt her essence.<br /><br />Vengeance was a bit on the minds of the gods, except melora, during that earlier scene.<br /><br />We all agree the guild must be stopped.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention that Melora may have some info.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel is asked what her orders were.&nbsp;&nbsp; And asks that those who did wrong be punished.&nbsp; The idea is that justice can be served without vengeance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says that when this is ended, he'lkl sumbit to the empire.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar is like its not my empire...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kith asks why, Zahar says that his death and <br /><br />resurrection were willed by Tharis Dune.&nbsp; <br /><br />Arwel&nbsp; presses the issue and Zahar says he wasn't truly murdered...&nbsp;&nbsp; they made a new sword to defeat vecna, then zahar was impaled by Sahrit Dubain.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar doesn't remember what happened next,and he arrived in Celestia, a realm of balanced nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; Shyell, the warden of madness, guards him from his own <br /><br />insanity.&nbsp; Isaline's father.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rsess, Isaline's mother, the warden of conviction walks the world here to see what can be done to make his will known and <br /><br />bring him peace and justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says he was bestowed the title the warden of faith...&nbsp;&nbsp; he looks so different now because hes infused with Tharis <br /><br />dune's will and power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says his mind and spirit are his own.&nbsp; But the fate of Tharis dune must remain important to him and he must work towards it.&nbsp; <br /><br />It effects us all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith says he should let us know that we recieved the blade from the lady of pain.&nbsp; Kith says he believes it can be used to destroy vecna shoudl he oppose <br /><br />us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar mentions that Kiransely is probably his oldest friend in the world...&nbsp;&nbsp; he has fought and perhaps destroy one of her eidolons and will figth a <br /><br />thousand more if necessary.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Incidentilly, do you recall the mission we went...&nbsp;&nbsp; for the marquis of... the one who was damaged...&nbsp; Dragontamer.&nbsp; his spouse was one of the <br /><br />cult.&nbsp; It was she whoa ttempted to bring Kith in.&nbsp; Zahar mentions that he was crippled because she poisoned him.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is dead because of actions that <br /><br />happened that night.&nbsp; Kith says we may see problems regarding hte empire.&nbsp; Kith says his time for secrets is coming to an end.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Kith asks if there's more to Tatenda than the fact that its his home time.&nbsp; Answer, not really.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar gives the plot dump on the dragon orbs and the nature of Io.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone scries near tatenda.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar mentions his world-eater title.&nbsp; Simone scries the city...&nbsp;&nbsp; finds the barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; its where she recalls.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scrying sensor show a bridge... sees it <br /><br />for a second,l then the effect was suddenly ended after like a round.&nbsp; <br /><br />We appear a few hundred feet away form the bridge.&nbsp;&nbsp; we feel reality shifted.&nbsp; We get in.&nbsp; We can see through the tube, of course.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside...&nbsp; it looks <br /><br />like there are a number of people inside... like a group has gathered.&nbsp;&nbsp; as we get closer, we can see at least a dozen men and women like confronting... <br /><br />there's an arura of menace... they're confronting Calenon in his elven form.&nbsp;&nbsp; he has maybe half a dozen clearly nomadic people.<br /><br />The oens arrayed against Calenon appear nondescript and of varying cultures.&nbsp; We walk through the tube and hear voices (Simone sheds the armor.)&nbsp; we let <br /><br />Kith out of the hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these people... they look like strangers... but there is a guy that we recognize...&nbsp;&nbsp; Its Thon rectard.&nbsp; <br /><br />All of the guys arrayed against Calenon are dopplegangers... but one guy looks like an amalgamation of different thigns...&nbsp;&nbsp; his hair is like 3 different <br /><br />colors... his skin is black and white, and peach and onyx black... in a bunch of different places.&nbsp;&nbsp; one hand looks stronger and more monstrous than the <br /><br />other.&nbsp; He's kiunda standing at an angle like his legs might not be the same length.&nbsp; <br /><br />Its Cilius Vartara.&nbsp; haha!&nbsp; <br /><br />We se thon threatening...&nbsp;&nbsp; in his orcish voice he's like "last chance, Calenon... leave now or there will be blood."&nbsp; Calenon looks very calm and says <br /><br />"Then we fight."&nbsp; He turns into an emerald dragon.&nbsp; Simone asks for some space and enhances her voice and shouts out "Aren't you looking for me?" and she's <br /><br />visible to them.&nbsp; Simone reverts form.&nbsp; All of them are transforming as well, and in the midst of that transformation, some of them turn and.&nbsp; <br /><br />I start up my song.&nbsp; Zahar vanishes from a quake from just outside the barrier.&nbsp; Thon tells 3 of them to get Simone.&nbsp;&nbsp; they attack her.&nbsp; <br /><br />Combat gets into full swing.&nbsp; They can clearly use the abilkities of the forms to some extent at least.&nbsp; Charm, fear, and slow and inflict wounds from the <br /><br />beholder hit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone tries to taunt them.&nbsp; The beholder turns and shouts that this is all Simone's fault.&nbsp; Simone disappears to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />The troll shrugs off the the greater shout effect with mettle.&nbsp;&nbsp; A bunch of them were stunned, most were injured.&nbsp; Simone senses that these shapeshifters <br /><br />have gear merged with them.&nbsp; The guy with the sword attacks Calenon.&nbsp; He doesn't automatically roll a 1 (the sword apparently needn't worry about that.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon is hit 5 times.&nbsp; With the sword.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's raging also.&nbsp; He does 185 vitality.&nbsp; Calenon passes all of his saves.&nbsp; Calenon breathes... notably avoids <br /><br />hitting us or his allies with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith feels that a bit of melora is gone as one of the guys is obliterated...&nbsp; not sure like destroyed or what.&nbsp; But gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />A swirly black thing... the earth there is kinda swampy.&nbsp; We sense profound evil form it.&nbsp; So its probably not Mordwlyn.,&nbsp; <br /><br />Kith is like try me on for size! and attacks with RAGGGE.&nbsp; He hits and does 49 damage...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when the guy his hit, his essence reacts strongly to the hit... <br /><br />The sword is tryign to take the divine essence but he's too powerful yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; 38 damage to cilius.&nbsp; Likewise with the trying to resis.t.. his essence is still <br /><br />kinda tainted...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like messed upo.&nbsp; Kith grows when he rages<br /><br />plot tastic event!&nbsp; The swamp has been growing steadily for a few seconds.&nbsp; a head emerges, and out of it steps a creature.&nbsp; Its clearly a devil.&nbsp; Its <br /><br />mammon, a creature that looks like a man-snake.&nbsp;&nbsp; "oh gods, Devils!"&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
