      <p>Prophecy, the word angers me. It came forth from Kas' mouth again and again. She wasn't who I remembered. Of course, very little of anything I knew then was ever true. I only realized how much I had loved her as my heart was broken by this realization. Was she ever who she claimed to be? Whatever she was or wasn't, she's not anymore.</p><p>Would it matter? I am dying. I don't have time for love. I don't have time for friends. It is my vengeance that keeps me warm at nite. It is all what is going wrong with the world that drives me forward. It is for my integrity that I fight.</p><p>Kas informed me of what I need to make the sword. With its strength at my side...</p><p>Gods, fate, and prophecy, there are many things in this world to which mortals can only bow to. With the sword, with help, with cause and strength, perhaps we can level the playing field. Make the world a world of mortal matters. Problems caused by mortal, solved by mortals. We deserve better then gods, fate, or prophecy can deliver. First, we see what it takes to kill a god.</p>
