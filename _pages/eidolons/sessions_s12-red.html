      <p>I seem to have helped summon a woman who is an enemy of Vance. &nbsp;A more productive day then usual. &nbsp;She also seems to be somehow similar to Jennifer somehow. &nbsp;She called herself Cas, and she seems to be quite powerful. &nbsp;In addition there is a horrible undead plague that has started, that infects very easily. &nbsp;The halfling is very&nbsp;insistent that this plague could destroy our world. &nbsp;I seem to still have a tenuous connection to Anne, which is encouraging, but I need to go in search of the Raven Queen. &nbsp;I need some answers, and I think the one to help me will be Isaline. &nbsp;I've continued to work on my runes, but I can't focus. &nbsp;I'll try to Journal again later.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><br />1/30/2010<br />Session 2-2<br /><br />(Joe had just summoned some woman which came out of Haruhn, who negatively rooted... then everyone quaked away).&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed and I find myself elsewhere.&nbsp; We are all present standing in a circle around a woman with leather armor... a whiff of fiendish appearance, Looks humanish close cropped black hair... and&nbsp;&nbsp; a belt with a symbol of st cuthbert... And an empty scabbard&nbsp;&nbsp; it's an imperial city.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We're at the palace, in a courtyard.&nbsp; We're probably in Elyria... I recognize that we're in the palace of the courtyard.&nbsp; Ed concentrates on the map,&nbsp; Lucas' character is&nbsp; a dragonborn runemage in appearance.&nbsp; <br /><br />Joe tells us that they tried to summon this person... <br /><br />Ed asks who she is, she says she's Kas and asks that we relocate.&nbsp; Isaline doesn't rule here in this place...&nbsp; Kas realizes that Isaline is singular... and so isn't in power when she's not here...&nbsp; <br /><br />Wrin emits a stream of buzzing... 'surprising, most surprising... most unusual, etc.'&nbsp;&nbsp; keeps going for a while.&nbsp; We leave after cleaning up.&nbsp; Some around the entrance at the courtyard just nod to us as we leave.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed asks me to scry admatha and the second commander in the eastern part. <br /><br />Soren Van wagrim is in charge when Isaline is not here...&nbsp; Or at least someone masquerading as him is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas "I've been dead for at least a year... I'd like a drink now.&nbsp; Lucas' character gives her a wine.&nbsp; <br /><br />The ritual to bring Kas...&nbsp; cameron, Isaline, haroun and some others...&nbsp; Haroun created a dark nexus and acted strangely before he did this... it made dark ley lines...&nbsp;&nbsp; Inverted nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; Danielle asks if its red.&nbsp; It wasn't.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />I ask their names Yos is Lucas' character Eraja is Danielle's character...&nbsp;&nbsp; (Kas quirks an eyebrow at me when I introduce myself and Wrin).&nbsp; Kas is hard to read... she finds us amusing at all times... there's also a faint sense of a faint air of 'weight of the world'.<br /><br /><br />We mention quick abotu tatenda.&nbsp; We tell Eraja and Yos about the ordering...&nbsp; Eraja mentions that they can cure the effects of the plague if its at the instant... no diea if it will work after they've been corrupted for some time.&nbsp; (No one in here detects as evil)... and no one became undead immediately to them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zombies are the most common profuct of the plague, but others come up occasionally.&nbsp; When we kill one, it explodes and everything nearby gets covered in goop (And has to save).&nbsp; Also, they're abnormally fast zombies (They're fast plague zombies from the Pathfinder bestiary).&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas thanks Joe for helping to bring her back.&nbsp; We talk to Kas about what killed her... and she says it was wounds... or Vance Dubain, depending on how you look at it..&nbsp;&nbsp; Vance is like Isaline, a human.&nbsp; Vance wished to correct the fact that he couldn't refresh and withered...&nbsp; They did a ritual to fix this... and it worked... and during hte transformation, he touched his son and corrupted him (Thats what vance took back).&nbsp;&nbsp; The sword was the Sword of Kas.&nbsp; Vance and Kas forged the sword together...&nbsp; It was made for use with this ritual.&nbsp; <br /><br />Why did Vance not choose to take the Devil's deal (And become a tiefling)...&nbsp; Asks Joe.&nbsp; Kas mentions its called the warlock pact.&nbsp; Vance is now undead (That's what hte ritual did).&nbsp; Kas died from delivering hte sword away form Vance.&nbsp; Kas says that when the sword has serbed its purpose it will be returned to Kas.... and that telling us would compromise the success of its mission.<br /><br />We ask Eraja where she was when she was attacked by the undead... there were 8 and they were very powerful.&nbsp; They can delay the grasp, but not reverse it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed confirms that The nexus in Heimdall is ok and not inverted.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says that the sword has been put to good and bad... <br />And that the purpose behind the attack on the emperor.&nbsp; Ask Admatha what happened.&nbsp; She says we have Yos to thank for that.&nbsp; He says he dopesn't know any idea...&nbsp;&nbsp; but Kas seems like she's carefuloly choose these words...&nbsp;&nbsp; She pretty much just came out and said that Yos was responsible.&nbsp; We should talk about this later.&nbsp; <br /><br />((Side note, Jeff totally hates the glibness spell so very much).)<br /><br />Kas shares interests with a god.&nbsp; A true one, not one of the fake one's Yos is concerned about...&nbsp;&nbsp; She says to Asks <br /><br />We get a private room in the back.&nbsp; The innkeeper says he'll see we are not disturbed.&nbsp; We ask for total privacy.&nbsp; There's no one else here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Once we're in here, Yos will kinda change form....&nbsp; into a scraggly elf.&nbsp; "That guy was such a square..."&nbsp;&nbsp; Kumo is in his real form...&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo says "The emperor's me... I screwed up...&nbsp; I tried to bring him back to life, and got kinda tired halfway through and went to sleep on the floor.&nbsp; He kinda got stuck in the door.&nbsp; I tried to bring him back to life, but he was -heavy-."<br /><br />Joe asks if they can make <br /><br />Kas says "You realize she's just waiting until you've forgiven her"&nbsp; To Joe.<br /><br />Joe says that he thought she hadn't forgiven her.&nbsp; Kas is laughing when Joe calls Ann his friend...&nbsp; "Your words cut me deep... I've been trying to make amends since".<br /><br />Joe says he has abilities related to withered undead.&nbsp; Kas goes and gets more drinks with Danielle tagging along...<br /><br />They return...<br /><br />Kas says that She and Joe are linked indirectly.&nbsp; Kas says "i know your lady love..."&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe... 'You know Jennifer?'&nbsp;&nbsp; "I am not her, but you can think of me as her sister.&nbsp; This goes beyond the flow... your village lies beyond hte flow in the lands of the raven queen... you must go there, she won't come to you."<br /><br />Kas let Kith out, Ed says.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says that Kith needs to be in the flow in the mortal realm, and she freed him form the abyss.&nbsp; The infinite layers of the abyss is the flow incarnate there.&nbsp; Graazt is indeed in resiidence in Delphia...&nbsp; Kas has been informed by some that were watching...<br /><br />Ed asks about the fate of Sahret's brother:&nbsp; "Yes, that is very clear to me...&nbsp; "&nbsp; Ed asks how much of a mistake it was "Like all things, good and bad.&nbsp; Vance was telling a grain&nbsp; of truth, Sahret might well have destroyed the world... but now that Vance has that power, he is that much more powerful.<br /><br />The raven queens agenda is at odds with that of the other gods.&nbsp; Ed asks of Kas "Are the [Raven queen's] goals your own?"&nbsp; 'Often, but not always.'<br /><br />We ask about the gods' goal.&nbsp; Kas reminds everyone that I know what's going on there.&nbsp; Asmodeus was genuine, says Kas.&nbsp; <br /><br />nerull is the least of your problems, Joseph (Says Kas)<br /><br />Kas says that if we're all seeking the truth...&nbsp;&nbsp; then your path begins in manavendra.&nbsp; (Ed confirms there's still an inverted nexus there).&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed asks who's sending us to Manavendra...&nbsp;&nbsp; "You could say its your destiny, but of course youc an turn away from it."<br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; "Can you tell us anything, or should we just stumble into there."<br /><br />Kas "I don't think I need to tell you more...&nbsp; You will find more about this plague there."<br /><br />It's midafternoon<br /><br />Joe asks if the plague is related to his abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas replied <br /><br />Kas says "Ultimately I seek vengence, but its not a simple thing...&nbsp;&nbsp; vengence for the world and the way it is....&nbsp;&nbsp; for many thing.s"<br /><br />Joe asks "Is this plan of the gods worthwhile, or are they doing it to gain personal power... is it more beneficial to teh people."<br /><br />Kas sighs: "Many of the gods, at least teh more noble-ish ones, if any of them could be noble, say they are doing it for well being, but ultimately they want to subjugate all mortals...&nbsp; You must break the chains...&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br /><br />Joe asks abotu the chains.&nbsp; "You have felt them sever them... it wasn't caused by you...&nbsp; During your impronsment it was..."<br /><br />Joe asks if it was done during hte experiments.<br /><br />K:&nbsp; "It isn't somethign that was done to your physical form... I don't knwo all the details myself, but your fate is tied to that of this world, Joseph."<br /><br />"The Nexuses are the chains that bind this world... but it is not enough to just collapse them... that would also result in the world's ruin"<br /><br />Joe asks about the ordering.<br /><br />"The brotherhood seeks vengence but it is misguided."<br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; "Vengence against what?"<br /><br />Kas "Eraja might know another way."<br /><br />The path to the truth begins at Manavendra.&nbsp; It believe that it is being revealed to you in prophecy... I do not know so much."<br /><br />Kas:&nbsp; "I'm sorry for being vague, but i know that you will need allies to pursue any solution and you might find any of them, there."&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo says he can become other guys too.&nbsp; Kumo when he becomes Yos just becomes like him...&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask Kas if she wants to sleep after having been dead for a while...&nbsp; She doesn't really feel the need to sleep.&nbsp; She's been drinking quite a bit.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're waiting for Kas to finish getting hammered.&nbsp; Kumo has a tophat (All of his forms wear the tophat. He mimes using to to change).&nbsp; Kas has a strong magical aura...&nbsp;&nbsp; Conjuration.&nbsp; <br />Sahret led the ritual.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Ed to Kas "What did you mean by true gods?"<br /><br />"Those who possess divine power... those who can gratn life to others, shoudl tehy so choose".<br /><br />"So the gods we encountered in the temple were not true gods"<br /><br />"Mostly, no."&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask to clarify the connection between Vance and Vecna.&nbsp; "Vance was vecna once... *Drinks again... getting a bit surly*.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vecna is Vance's replacement.&nbsp; The New Vecna stole his power... "&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; "Vance has his son swear to his replacement not to destroy the world"<br /><br />Kas:&nbsp; "That's right... it must have been hard for him... *laugh*&nbsp; Would you want to swear an oath to someone you hate?&nbsp;&nbsp; Bah, I'm going to kill all those motherfuckers...&nbsp;&nbsp; all those goddamned gods."&nbsp; Some kind of effect twashes over her... but she didn't do it.. (or at least, didn't cast a spell)... we can sense that it happened... some kind of conjuration healing effect... like remove poison... and she suddenly appears sober.<br /><br />"What exactly did the gods do?" asks ed.<br /><br />Kas Is upset, Ed detects.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's upset at herself, not any of us.<br /><br />"It would be wrong to speak ill of the gods."<br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; "And yet you felt the need top say it."<br /><br />kas:&nbsp; "The fake ones wouldn't be gods, so you can speak ill of them..."<br /><br />We ask which are which.&nbsp; "If you are under the impression that those at the temple of sigil are fake, you are mistaken.&nbsp; "<br /><br />Kas "I have much to do...&nbsp;&nbsp; I must meditate on all that has happened in the past year."&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo:&nbsp; "What I've learned abotu this planet is that you only owe people something unless you think you do."&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask Kas if I may have a lock of hair so as to more easily contact her later.<br /><br />She says :It would be of very little use to you in the capacity you anticipate.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as such i fear i will decline for now.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas leaves... Wrin says "Her lucky numbers are 7 and 13"&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo destroys the cup after/during a long discussion about invasion of privacy and such.<br /><br />ed looks at Wrin and calls him inferior and Wrin emits a low growl in response.&nbsp; <br /><br />Wrin says "She is more likely to find us, but be ready" In a very... comprehensive sort of ready.<br /><br />As we walk through the city the streets seem pretty empty.&nbsp; There are people about, but the people seem reluctant to come out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I apporach a passerby&nbsp; and ask whby the city is unusually quiet...<br /><br />The woman mentions about the explosion at the palace...&nbsp; some people are disturbed about the explosion from the palace...&nbsp; I canm't believe that beardthicket guy came here...&nbsp; that guy's a jerk.&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change anything for me... I just wish the markets will open back up.&nbsp; He's just trying to sow dissension and deestroying the empire... well it won't work."<br /><br />Many people have apparently fled to manavendra.&nbsp; because it hasn't been attacked.&nbsp; Angeline says they're fools and idiots (In agreement to Kumo)... if you see my brother Buckley give him a good push for me, right in the face!"<br /><br />We see more refugees/travellers going from Elyria...&nbsp; they're going to manavendra, we pass over them..&nbsp; Kumo calls out "You're doing it wrong!" To them as we go by.<br /><br />There are small outposts every so often.&nbsp; We keep going...&nbsp; We camp <br /><br />Kumo Tells Joe: Olidammara isn't a person or thing... its a state of mind.. people who want to be Olidammara become olidammarra."&nbsp;&nbsp; His shrine was taken apart a bit.&nbsp; And Kumo gave Joe a bit of the shrine that he had taken.&nbsp; <br /><br />Joe asks why Kumo stole Olidammaras image/took it back.&nbsp; Did it so he could let other olidammaras know he was Olidammara.<br /><br />joe Talks to Ann... she says that Joe should speak to the raven queen, Joe says should I meet with isaline?&nbsp; Ann Says "You need a portal, isaline can help."&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo says he's a friend to Joe...&nbsp; Joe mentiosn he's trying to find the raven queen.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />I try to scry Admatha and get "Scrying failed".&nbsp; <br /><br />I see him in Manavendra.&nbsp; I see him at a table wiht the other three paladins we knew who were in the unit.&nbsp; <br /><br />One says "Quite surprising to get help from that source."<br /><br />Another "Well, it owuldn't be gracious of us to turn it down before they try something".<br /><br />"I can't believe someone so secretive for so long would be so willing to talk."<br /><br />I mention that I'm going to be arriving tomorrow to them.<br /><br />They stop talking and the guy passes along that I'll arrive tomorrow if all goes well. ' There is much for us to discuss... the plagued... they attacked here but we defended them off... but if it weren't for the temples and the dark elves we'd not have been successful.&nbsp; Be cautious...&nbsp;&nbsp; We did not destroy all of the plagued.&nbsp; Some escaped and mmay be on or near the road.&nbsp; I am happy that you survived, sir.&nbsp; We may have some new weapons.'&nbsp; So they were wonder.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo goes off for a little bit as I cast my scrying.&nbsp; <br /><br />We awaken.&nbsp; Kumo offers an apology with a lock of his alleged hair,.&nbsp; I accept both.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I amplify and call out a warning as we Pass over the guys again.&nbsp; As we get near the city we see fighting.&nbsp; it looks like they're fighting maybe half a doze or so of the plague.&nbsp; It looks liek the people are winning...&nbsp; two of them are our paladins... the other two aren't in this fight.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 4 more fighters, and they're winning.&nbsp; One of the figthers gets hit and a paladin cures him.&nbsp; <br /><br />These thigns don't leave bodies, because the bodies explode.&nbsp; <br /><br />Our seargent says we might be coming The people who really run the show are the Norns... but this Boris guy has been getting a foothold here... they're pretty appreciative of what he's trying to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it weren't for him they probably wouldn't have been able to defend this city.<br /><br />How did boris Help?&nbsp; (Ed)<br /><br />He brought a substantial force...&nbsp; we were frankly overwhelmed until they showed up...&nbsp; We sent messengers to neighboring cities.&nbsp; No word back form them yet.&nbsp; He arranges a meeting between us, boris and the captain of the norns.&nbsp; <br /><br />manavender is rather large... there are signs of fighting... lots of stuff is ruined.&nbsp; There are some dragonborn, dwarves, etc...&nbsp; but the bodies are mostly cleaned up... fewer peopel than we would expect.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Sergeatn explains that people have mostly taken refuge in the temples...&nbsp; The plague won't go in, regardless of tyeh deity...&nbsp; And none of the norns guarding the nexus were even attacked.&nbsp; Withered always make a beeline for nexuses (Even sequestered ones).&nbsp; <br /><br />boris and his people contributed troops and they were helping incidently because they wanted to protect the nexus from beardthicket.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />healing right away has to be done... it has to be remove disease sort of thing.<br /><br /><br />We should speak to boris...&nbsp;&nbsp; He's from the underground.&nbsp; So far they've been helpful.. they did defend the nexus against the plagued.&nbsp; <br /><br />We mention that the plague of undead is a side effect of the ordering and say hat the ordering is.<br /><br />The Norn leader is called Egorin, grandmaster of the heaven's fist style.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's a dragonborn... kinda reminiscent of&nbsp; Zahar... he's quiet and wears minimalizstic clothing... looks like an ascetic 'peace with teh universe for'<br /><br />Boris is a ostentatious looking tiefling.. wearing rings and jewelry... he's got big horns and a tail...&nbsp; He's the guy who was arguing with the Emperor's ghost in his throne room. heavyset, well muscled...&nbsp;&nbsp; He smells a little strange....&nbsp; maybe some strange perfume...&nbsp;&nbsp; Black cloak decorated with designs...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The sergeant&nbsp; says that we should be informed.<br /><br />boris "We were here to stop that bearthicket... my former comrade.."&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed asks how the plagued got in...&nbsp; "They simply walked here, from the areas previously infected.&nbsp; They came in vast numbers, They simply made undead ladders to scale the walls, but several possessed ways to destroy walls and gates...&nbsp;&nbsp; There were just too many.&nbsp; Once they had breached the gate, they poured in through the entryway...&nbsp;&nbsp; by the time me and mine arrived, that bottleneck was breached.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ask our sergeant about losses:&nbsp; "losses are still being counted... most took refuge in the temple... hallowed ground is safe ground.. and they didn't approach the nexus..."<br /><br />No norn needed to raise a weapon in this combat.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We plot dump the info we know of the brotherhood of order.&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris looks upset at this news.&nbsp; It's all the more reason for me and mine to remain here... those in the underground need this.&nbsp;&nbsp; We cannot allow another nexus to go under.&nbsp; "<br /><br />I ask if he sees the effect of the ordering underground.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Near mael tarath... but we don't build our cities aorund an inverted nexus...&nbsp; they could collapse at any time...&nbsp; and the explosion when it does is dangerous.&nbsp; <br /><br />We don't know how it was caused.<br /><br />Boris:&nbsp; "If I didn't know better, the undead seem they're being led...&nbsp; they had a commander of sorts... we destroyed it of course.&nbsp; it seemed to be directing the efforts of mindless ones...&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a whiff of brimstone...&nbsp; you notice these things when you possess these same traits.&nbsp; "<br /><br />Is there a devil working against Asmodeus?&nbsp; Asks Joe <br /><br />Boris Laughs&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; Everyone works against asmodeus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris says that Asmodeus doesn't often talk to Boris' kind.<br /><br />The undead seem to have been acting to infect as manmy as possible.&nbsp; They did go after livestock and other nonsentients?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris:&nbsp; "A number of the invading force was animal in nature...&nbsp; clearly they washed over farms and such on their way here."&nbsp; <br /><br />He looks to Eraja and says "Some of you are geomancers... I would value your input...&nbsp; I've been tryign to see what's happening with the nexus here, but its difficult...&nbsp; I'm not skilled in prophecy... I always took an interest in the flow of energy.&nbsp; I confess it was I who inverted the nexuses of the empire.&nbsp; "<br /><br />Demons normally appear through an inverted nexus, but the underdark ward them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed says he was there when Grazzt was making that deal... the experience was frustrating...&nbsp;&nbsp; They took the offer of unlimited cannon fodder to try and prevent the apocalypse.&nbsp; I gave them my opinion and what would happen... looks like i was right.<br /><br />Boris:&nbsp; How do deal with this plague.&nbsp; It seems to be infernally directed.&nbsp; Perhaps the ordering was the source.&nbsp; <br /><br />I remind that Arwel said the nexus was inverted.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are people with appropriate healing training that the damage can be taught... but we can't have paladins everywhere... so lesser towns are increasingly susceptible.&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris "The prophecies as I've recieved them were merely indicative that an answer may come soon."&nbsp; <br /><br />Eraja seems a bit flattered.&nbsp;&nbsp; Boris says "Perhaps you bring a different knowledge to this type of endeavor..."&nbsp; <br />The Norns do not possess the capability to detect people travelling through the lines...&nbsp; Egorin says they've taken some further precautions... no longer is it possible to watch the nexus from without...&nbsp;&nbsp; We keep it sequestered, but we must have the door open.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We give the platemail of the Norn to Egorin.&nbsp; It is highly unusual for me to allow you into the nexus (To Eraja)...&nbsp;&nbsp; but given the circumstances *smirk8&nbsp; It seems the best course.&nbsp; <br /><br />We show the bastard sword...&nbsp; ask if its standard issue.&nbsp; We say its unusualWe would expect the Norn of the north, under Bloodletter.&nbsp; Egorin describes the Barbarian rage style.&nbsp; They discuss... Egorin discusses that he teaches the way of the heavebn fist, a deva style.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed mentions Zahar and Egorin raises an eyebrow.&nbsp; Zahar was Egorin's student.&nbsp; We mention that Pelor spoke with Zahar...&nbsp;&nbsp; "Zahar always struck me as someone with great potential."&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo asks why its unusual...&nbsp; basically, gods don't normally walk the world.&nbsp; Kumo gets the plot dump of what's been going on with the empire with the emperor's edict.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are all brought to the nexus dome.&nbsp; The one door is unsealed and open and there are two norns, one facing in an d one facing out... watching for anything going either way.&nbsp; And its still ringed by Norns.&nbsp; The Norns move to block our path, but Egrin says "At ease, lads... there are greater challenges than these..."&nbsp; One of the Norns allows us through, the other thigks that this is simply unallowable... but backs down when the grandmaster says come through.&nbsp; A third norn asks if this is a good idea.&nbsp; "No, I'm not sure it is, but I believe its our best course of action."&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed and I stay out and watch from the doors.&nbsp; The energy actively bends around joseph, Kumo is unaffected, Egorin doesn't go inside.&nbsp; "I will watch here."&nbsp; (I'll be here if anything goes wrong or if you do something stupid or someone else tries to interfere).&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris says "Shall we proceed?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Boris Sounds unsure... this isn't his area of expertise...&nbsp; he sits down cross legged and closes his eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo is just watching...&nbsp; Boris is meditating... raspy breath.&nbsp; Eraja also meditates.&nbsp; <br /><br />Eraja's vision<br />Nothing... nothing... then faster than like ever, Eraja jumps into prophetic fugue.&nbsp;&nbsp; As before when she's felt a resurging prophecy...&nbsp;&nbsp; this is like another prophecy coming back to you... like 2 prophecies at once... entwined strands, and they're symbiotic off eachother somehow.&nbsp; And being in this palce they've come together.&nbsp; <br />She sees a nexus in a deplhian city, springforth with energy neither positive nor negative... and as the plague spread across the world, this erupts and it cleanses everything... many of the plagued are destroyed, some are returned to life.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the strongest, clearest vision she's had.&nbsp; It happens very quickly... after about a minute or so its over.&nbsp; <br />Sense as to what might have caused it or where the nexus was... nope... but when she opens her eyes, boris is out of trance and staring at Eraja bemusadly.&nbsp; Eraja "Did you see it too?"&nbsp; Boris shakes head...&nbsp;&nbsp; But I did experience the strengh of it...<br /><br />How did you learn to do that?&nbsp; "Practice... many centuries..."<br /><br />Egorin:&nbsp; "Thank you for indulging us."<br /><br />Eraja says what she saw :&nbsp; "I saw this vision in a weaker form, divided, previously.&nbsp; And... I know more what to do with it now, but I thin k we need to proceed cautiosly, and anyu interpretation you all might be able to provide would be appreciated. shares the vision...&nbsp; <br />Egorin<br /><br />Eraja says "I odn't know where this is or what will cause it but this niether natural nor inverted energy will be the cure of the plague."<br />&nbsp; The wellspring clearly comes from a delphian city...&nbsp; <br /><br />eraja's interpretation (62).&nbsp; The wellspring comes from two things brought together... its a vision of the possible furture.. the washing over the land is symbolic but also literal on a slower scale... and it will cure withered.&nbsp; And there is some kind of catalyst needed.&nbsp; <br />Eraja Knows that its a delphian city but not which one or where.. and its the result of two things combining with a catlyst...&nbsp;&nbsp; people, energy... +/- nexuses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed thinks:&nbsp;&nbsp; Terminus...&nbsp;&nbsp; hopefully not... oraculum...&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmmm... Two nexuses... combin ing....&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're going to cram two nexuses together."&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris says&nbsp; "You spoke of combining two energies."&nbsp; When inverted energy is brought together with positive energy, the result is violent, to say the least... we have tried such things in experimentation, but it is difficult to try...&nbsp; but perhaps some ritual to merge them...&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe put a barrier between them...&nbsp; <br /><br />The delphians have had bad experiences inverting their nexuses.&nbsp; At this point they're unlikely to agree to this procedure.&nbsp; <br /><br />"The easiest way to convince them is to show them what I showed you.&nbsp; "&nbsp; <br /><br />Boris seems intrigued with doing this to Oraculum.&nbsp; it is the primary source of Delphian propphecy... because there are two nexuses, it amplifies the power.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed and I could pass as Delphians.&nbsp; Boris says it would be best if he didn't come with us... but you could use my help in this ritual...&nbsp;&nbsp; I could probably help... I have invert the nexus.<br /><br />Boris is untrusting...&nbsp; has had bad experience swith cooperation.<br /><br />Boris, Egorin (Who is just staring off into space... he's said nothign since the vision).&nbsp; We try to get Egorin's attention.. he doesn't respond when we wave our hands in front of them...&nbsp; and poking him does it<br /><br />"This is what I've been seeking... a true balance...&nbsp; Long have I known my style is one sided... Zahar knew this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have pursued both paths... yet still I thought enlightenment lay in the calming of the mind but now I realize the simplicty of this approach.&nbsp; Don't you see?&nbsp; Neither way is the way, yet both are... Zahar was right."<br /><br />Ed:&nbsp; "Is there anythign we can do to help you explore thsi further."<br /><br />Eg:&nbsp; "I have seen this before...&nbsp; I knew it was personal but I never knew...&nbsp;&nbsp; is the world really ready for this?&nbsp; Is this really the will of the gods, what you are proposing?"&nbsp; <br /><br />Kumo says that some of these are fake...<br /><br />Eg says that "I believe your vision was a macrocosm of our struggles as individuals... and it is possible to find an balance within oneself as well...&nbsp; I have seen it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of my dear friends years ago... many decades... it has been some time.&nbsp; And yet, if this is truly somethign that can be done to the world itself, I know not what to think...&nbsp;&nbsp; I will not stand in your way.&nbsp; I may wish to join you...&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of my students would not be ready for such a thing. ut I must think on this"&nbsp; <br /><br />I say i'll try to contact Zahar if possible.&nbsp; <br />The only two nexuses taht are so very close together in any kind of a&nbsp; close organized place... as he scans over oraculum... he sees something is different... both nexuses have been inverted....&nbsp; <br />Ed 'Ladies and gentlemen, they're both inverted.'<br /><br />Eraja:&nbsp; "We can fix that" With a sly smile.<br /><br />(("You're scanning over the world, roll me a perception check."<br />&nbsp;Curt, on Jon's scanning the 'map'))<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>
