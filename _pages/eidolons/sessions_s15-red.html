      <p>Fickle fickle fate. Maybe it wants to keep me away from Sigil because I can’t do anything there. Then again, maybe it’s because I could. Especially after today.’<br /><br />Fate plopped me down in Oraculum (well under, way under) along with a sizable group of people. A lot was going on, and I was glad to be able to help, at least a little. I feel bad about not being able to help out more. <br /><br />There were a few people there I didn’t really know. A few geomancers along with a elvish druid Dariel, among others.<br /><br />Oraculum is unique in that it has two nexi, and they are fairly close together. Our goal was to revert one nexus and then combine them. The other group was to draw the attention of the creatures above ground. The ritual we were performing couldn’t handle too much of an interuption. <br /><br />Our first task was to find a suitable focus to create the new nexus. Kith suggested we use our rings, but besides a scary reaction, it didn’t amount to much. I wonder why Ktih wants to get rid of his ring though. Mine hasn’t been good for much other than drawing unwanted suspicion.<br /><br />Anyways, Joseph provided a skeleton of a frost giant to use as our foucs. Before we could start though, we had to revert one nexus. I had never done this before, though I tried. I had help of course, Iraja and two other geomancers were helping. Once we coaxed out the heart and I tried to hold it steady while positive energy was channeled into it. Unfortunately, it was a little to erratic for me. I had to hand it off to Iraja and watch her endure the pain the inverted heart was causing her.<br /><br />Once the nexus was flipped, we started phase two. Energies from each nexus were channeled into me and into Za’har. We pumped that energy through Joseph and into the skeleton. Dariel provided healing as needed. We were attacked once or twice, but I couldn’t even turn to look. Za’har left to help with a fight but rejoined near the end.<br /><br />Once complete, there wasn’t an explosion or anything, but we did create a balanced nexus! I loved all nexus energy, but this was purer and more powerful than anything I had experience before. It had significant effects on some of those around us, including bringing Admatha back to life!<br /><br />Maybe this is our salvation. This is how we can solve the plague, allow all to refresh, even correct an ordered nexus. This could save the lands in the underdark and make their curse irrelevant. Maybe it could even help the empire.<br /><br />I hope that it’s stable, but it just feels right, so I can only hope.</p>

      <p>I've done it. &nbsp;We...we combined a positive and negative nexus, and it required the prison for the energy encased in my body. &nbsp;It was the most painful process I've experienced, but also liberating when it&nbsp;occurred. &nbsp;Several demons attacked us, but the others fought them off. &nbsp;This new nexus energy, it&nbsp;refreshed&nbsp;everyone. &nbsp;Including Anne. &nbsp;She was returned to flesh, yet retains her ghostly powers. &nbsp;I have absolved myself of a great portion of my guilt. &nbsp;We were forced to escape the city, because in the course of creating the new nexus we somehow allowed Demigorgan to enter our world. &nbsp;The Raven Queen also seems to have sacrificed herself to destroy one of the Demon Lords.</p><p>But just seeing this new Nexus gives me ideas. &nbsp;What if I could do such a fusion with the energy I contain within me? &nbsp;How is this tied to these 'chains' I feel? &nbsp;The more time that passes on, the more I feel I am not just a strange human. &nbsp;I think the Raven Queen has more in store for me then I could have guessed. &nbsp;For now I must simply focus on helping Anne adjust, and working on my own runes in light of what I've learned.</p>
