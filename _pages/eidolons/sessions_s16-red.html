      <p>No new answers to report, but I've got
a few more questions to jot down.  Thankfully these don't seem to be
the “what is the true nature and history of this world and what
should I be doing about it” type questions.  These are more of the
“would be good to know” type.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First, what's Ed's teacher's role to
play with this.  She showed up for a minute after a quake while we
were on our way to visit the Tsen tribe.  I could see that she was
part of the ritual to summon Demigorgon.  I could also see some of
her time training Ed, some of her time with the T'sen, and even that
a previous version of Ed had killed someone dear to her.  What we
make her help the new Ed?  More to the point, what is the real story?
 Who was on what side, supporting what cause?  The answer to that may
help figure out what she's up to now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Second, what's the deal with the quake
in Arx?  I know quakes move people through the flow to other versions
on this world.  That must be what happened to us, but why did only
some of us remember?  And why did those of us who forgot still have
some memories of the events after being reminded?  Maybe only some of
us were brought along?  Was it a case of two realities collapsing on
each other?  It would be easy to write this off as chance, though I'm
hesitant to say any of my life, at least this past year or so has
actually been chance.  I feel like I'm still someone's puppet, though
I don't know who, or even if it's always the same puppet-master,
though I aim to find out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Questions aside, this has been a
productive trip so far.  We made it to the Tsen  encampment where we
were able to meet with their leader, and get a pledge for at least
some support.  Delphia is also going to send what they can.  Of
course they don't like the idea of everyone being involved, but we're
going to need as much support to take and hold the city as possible. 
Also, I'll be a lot more comfortable with many eyes watching over the
new nexus.  I want to keep anyone from having enough power or
influence to do anything to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Of course we had to do more than ask. 
I hate to bring them in to this, as they have tried their best to
keep out of trouble.  They haven't done crazy experiments like the
Delphians, or live under the “blessings” of the”gods” like
the empire.  Of course, in the same vein, I had to convince Sibil (a
Delphian leader who also had the wisdom to avoid these mistakes, but
lacked the influence to stop their folly, to apologize and take
responsibility for their mistakes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Why should we all have to pay the price
for these mistakes?  Why do I have to ask others to pay for mistakes
that they themselves avoided, or even actively tried to stop?  Or
maybe I should look at this another way.  At least we have something
that the different groups can agree on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
