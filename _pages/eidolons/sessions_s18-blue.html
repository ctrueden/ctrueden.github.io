      <p>Never in my life have I seen the like. &nbsp;Today I faced against the five most powerful Dragons in our world, with only a handful of allies. &nbsp;Its the closest to death I have ever come, and if it weren't for Anne sacrificing her form we would have lost the day. &nbsp;They were beautiful and terrifying, what surprises me the most was how well we did. &nbsp;My Deeper Darkness protected us greatly, but we were all&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to our victory.</p><p>I've learned how to directly channel the energy I drain into Anne, thus it is not wasted if I can not finish the creature I face. &nbsp;Anne became very powerful, and was able to aid me in my energy&nbsp;absorption. &nbsp;We barely pulled through though.</p><p>All dragons in the world are now Jem dragons. &nbsp;How interesting. &nbsp;To change them into Metallic, we would have to fight hell itself. &nbsp;Still this knowledge is helpful. &nbsp;Io is now in control rather then Tiamat. &nbsp;This is better then nothing. &nbsp;I think today we have truly done something legendary.</p>

      <p>Dragons, what do they know of strength? What do they know of greatness? A true familiarity with these things involves knowing what it is to be without. We mortals struggle, we toil for so little share of the world. Some achieve more. Some find the greatness and strength denied us mortals for so long. We who find greatness are the stronger for having started weak. Those born into greatness, those given greatness, they do not have to struggle. They do not know the other side of the coin.</p><p>Today, I know the other side of the coin. Today, I fall before greatness. I bore up up my strength against tooth and nail and failed. It is only by&nbsp;vicious&nbsp;mercy I still live. Today, I learned that there is no room for error. Death is the simplest cost for failure. Next time I make a mistake, there might be too much at stake for me to afford it.</p>

      <p>I don’t usually write about my dreams.  Then again, I usually don’t dream about writing about my dreams either.  I expect that I waken shortly, still in this overly comfortable bed in the Warlock’s stronghold.  The presence of two former emrorers, along with the recent fights over the nexus, not to mention the sheer amount of magic that has run through these halls must have helped spawned this dream.<br /><br />Anyways, onto the dream.  I awoke in Sigil along with Admatha, Dragontamer, Sahrit, and Joseph.  Everyone seemed at little surprised to be here, though Dragontamer was lost.  He had heard of some of the prophesies regarding this place, but knew little more than that.  We filled him in a little on it’s history, and we used the map downstairs to help.<br /><br />We also found out something interesting from the map.  Balanced nexuses appear as grey.  I say nexuses because, while there is only one now, we looked back in time and saw more.  All of them infact.  The first nexus was here at Sigil.  We watched as it’s power crawled along the world, forming new nexuses as it went.  Then, over time, they all seemed to change to positive.  Not sure what influenced, or why positive instead of negative, but they seemed to degenerate that way.  It is, however, impossible to get a sense of timescale, so I have no idea how stable our new balanced nexus really is.  I just know that it’s still balanced.<br /><br />Everone had pressing questions, especially for me and what had happened in the Underdark, but Dragontamer’s concern was for his assistant.  I scried her, and as he expected, she was freaking out.  I communicated with her to let her know that he was okay, and that he would be returned shortly.  I also passed the message from Dragontamer that she was right about everything.<br /><br />Given the dangers of the area, and Dragontamer’s lack of ability to be teleported or hidden away in a portable hole, the only way to return him was to use the map.  Unfortunately, the map can only take us to other nexuses, and the empire is running low.  And those that it has are sealed off.  I arranged with Dragontamer’s assistant to meet us at the closest nexus.  She agreed, and so we went.<br /><br />She met us as the nexus with some strange news.  Tiamat’s priests had broken the curse on the dragon orb!  I didn’t even know they were trying.  That’s what I get for not paying too much attention to them.  Anyways, she said they would be weary, and now was the time to strike.  <br /><br />We found an out of the way spot near a lay line so I could do some reconnaissance.  We started by looking for the fire wand that Za’har had in hell.  Sadly, it had fallen into the hands of Demogorgon.  One head looked like it was about to zap the other.  I tried to encourage him, but only managed to focus there rage onto me.  I wish them a nice day and let them be.  <br /><br />With that wand unreachable, we figured the priestess of the red might have hers stored at her palace.  After a little preparation Dragontamer’s assistant teleported us there.  We fought with some fire elementals, and made our way to an alter.  Sahrit attempted to offer his blood to Tiamat, but was rejected.  Dragontamer’s assistant offered hers and was accepted.  Inside we found not the wand, but Moradin’s helm.  Sahrit donned it, and of we went to try to retrieve the orb.<br /><br />They were ready for us, and instantly angered that we had the helm.  No help for it, we were going to have to fight.  If we could kill the White, then the orb would revert to the next strongest white dragon.  Hopefully this was the assistant.  <br /><br />The white was in the middle of the icy room.  The others were in the corners.  Joseph blacked out the room.  He and Sahrit rushed forward to attack the white dragon.  Admatha was no where to be seen.  The assistant headed of to the right to hold the green dragon at bay.  I made myself invisible and sent an image of myself to the left corner behind the black.  I was trying to draw some attention, but completely failed.<br /><br />The white dragon drew back and the dragons tried to destroy us with their breath weapons, but they had no effect on us.  Their direct attacks were much more damaging.  The darkness helped, but the blows came fast and hard.  I joined the battle near the white dragon.  Barnebus was holding off the blue and the white dragons, Sahrit was making a little headway, and Joseph was draining the white for as much as he could.  The assistant joined the attack on the white, but it wasn’t enough.<br /><br />Sahrit was down and bleeding, the assistant was dead.  Joseph was hurt.  Ann had tried to take over the red, but failed.  I had given what little I had left to keep Sahrit alive.  I could avoid a couple attacks if it came down to that, but things were looking dire.  I would survive, and I could take a couple people with me, but not everyone.<br /><br />Admatha came rushing into the room.  She prayed to her god to help the assistant, and her request was granted.  Ann joined with Joseph for a very devastating strike on the white dragon.  It was old and withered down to practically nothing.  The final blow was struck, killing the white dragon.  <br /><br />The orb must have reverted to Dragontamer’s assistant.  The dragons changed to more gemlike dragons.  They were still upset, but they quit attacking.  I took the crown, wanting to use it for leverage.  I want them to help reclaim the nexus.  I didn’t get to antagonize Demogorgon into joining this fight, so I want to bring this fight to him (them?).  The red dragon wanted the crown back, and was getting a little snippy.  I gave in and gave it back.  I hope to go talk to them tomorrow and get them to join in.<br /><br />Fighting the 5 priests of Tiamat...  still not sure that actually happened.  It surely wasn’t what I had planned.  Hopefully it actually happened.  I really like the idea of the dragons at least tending a little bit more towards our side.  I’ll probably roll over, rub my eyes, and still be in the Underdark.  Maybe this is a sign of something I should work towards.  Guess we’ll see when I wake up.<br /><br /></p>
