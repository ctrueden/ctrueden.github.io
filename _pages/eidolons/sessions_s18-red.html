      <p>Well our search for military forces led us to Elyria and an encounter with Marquis Ironheart.&nbsp; After some brief negotiations he agreed to assist us so long as we put a stop to Jonas and the ordering.&nbsp; Sometimes it just that simple eh?</p><p>Ironheart also informed us of the current plan of the Delphians in Arx to construct an ironwood lineship to breach Tat'enda.&nbsp; However the Delphians would need the Imperial stockpile of ironwood in order to build such a vessel.&nbsp; In an unsurprising change of pace, or a continuation of bad luck, the stockpile is in the ordered city of Trimsaran.&nbsp; While I do not understand the magical powers of ironwood, I see the importance of retaking that cache.&nbsp; Jonas might be insane to do these things, but he is no fool to cut us off from the stockpile.&nbsp; With this information several of us took off for 'holiday' in Arx.</p><p>Lo and behold, the Delphians were already along on their plan upon our arrival but one suit of armor&nbsp;was not enough.&nbsp; When we informed Silius, who is&nbsp;in charge of the construction, of the Imperial stockpile a mission to raid Trimsaran was quickly ordered.&nbsp; A little to my surprise the mission went off without a hitch.&nbsp; The soldier reported the city to be completely empty.&nbsp; It seems a little foolish that with an infinite number of soldiers no guards were assigned to this critical weakness.&nbsp; The small ship was completed quickly enough after, but unsurprisingly misfortune struck.&nbsp; The low and treacherous Silius dominated the crew and took the ship in the night.</p><p>We quickly tracked them down but it seems that Jonas, or rather Calanon, had made short work of them.&nbsp; Why does the fact that an elder green wyrm would lead a nomad tribe not surprise me any longer?&nbsp; I chose to strike at the greater foe but Calanon's geomancy was beyond even my power.&nbsp; Silius fled like the scum he is through the ordering and I am unsure what has happened to him.&nbsp; Once equipped with ironwood Vashir and were able destroy several of Calanon's images, but Biger and Dariel saved us from being overwhelmed.&nbsp; Still he was likely the greatest threat I have yet faced.&nbsp; He accepted an offer to have a mark of justice placed on him to prevent further attacks.&nbsp; While Ironheart was brought in to oversee the agreement that we had made a drastic change occurred in the beast.&nbsp; It seems that one of the Orbs of Dragonkind is now possessed by another.&nbsp; I can only imagine it was the work of the others, but the exact details I can hardly imagine.</p><p>So now we seem to be set to have the war council and begin the assault on Oraculum.&nbsp; I feel unsure what must be done beyond retaking the dual nexuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;The things that once mattered most to me are now uncertain:&nbsp;returning to the Empire is not as appealing as it once was, I cannot simply live with my family knowing what I now know,&nbsp;I do not trust the gods to any significant degree, learning the names of my parents&nbsp;and how they came to be human gives me little solace after forty two years, and the fact that as a human I possess a single unknown&nbsp;destiny (unlike almost all the others) is no comfort.&nbsp; All that seems to be left is to fight and some day die&nbsp;against those who would use this world to their own desires be they a demon, devil, god, or mortals.&nbsp; If that is what must be then I shall become such a force that those who survive shall never forget my name.</p>

      <p><br />5/15/2010<br /><br />Who is the regent of the empire?&nbsp; Dragontamer...?<br /><br />Where does the flow coalesce?&nbsp; Sigil was Marj's response.&nbsp; I say between the boundaries between the planes.&nbsp; Then Jesse chooses...&nbsp;&nbsp; that it coalesces where Isaline was regent.&nbsp; Feels the flow bending around him/her and s/he knows where his/her destiny is, and thats not it.&nbsp; Now Dave gets a try.&nbsp; Elyria is his answer.&nbsp; <br /><br />so I am in red group.&nbsp; <br /><br />We find ourselves in elyria in the palace.&nbsp; marquis Ironheart is also present.&nbsp; He's like right next to us, he looks around slightly confused.&nbsp; (Ironheart is the lord of valhalla which is the southern region of the empire.&nbsp; He's also espanded the most into the feywood and has decidedly hostile negotiations wiwth the fey in that area.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is extrememly skilled with a blade and hates the fey, he's a dragonborn.&nbsp; He has a very military uniform.&nbsp; <br /><br />He looks aroudn again, recognizes his surroundings and looks around all of us.&nbsp; Isaline isn't recognized by him.&nbsp; I am recognized by him.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart moves towards the castle, we follow him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He speaks to one of the servents and says he requires someone to cast a sending to alexandria so he can obtain teleportation.&nbsp; He waits for a moment, shakes his head and moves towards the waiting quarters.&nbsp; <br /><br />I know that Ironheart and von wagrim were the two marquis trying to negotiatie with eloyes.&nbsp; Since that time, they've had bad relatiosn with both but ironheart was willing to negotiate trade for materials the eloyes couldn't obtain on their own in exchange for materials formt here.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's supposed to be respectable, is a paladin of bahamut, fiercely dislikes the fey because he's been at war witht hem for centuries.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has two swords.&nbsp;&nbsp; one is designed to kill the fey, the other to kill withered undead.&nbsp; The others also know he's responsible to training all the troops in the empire.&nbsp; He has a general who is there to head up their defenses as a country against te fey, but ironheart trains most of the troops.&nbsp; He is by far the most organized of all the marquis.&nbsp; He is a brilliant tactitian, wiseman, but also a zealot.&nbsp; <br /><br />The angle we're going to use is hgoing to be It's a glorious combat, against an open foe, against demons, who they'll be effective against because of their anti-fey training.&nbsp; <br /><br />If we could sell the angle that nexuses in balance could stabilize the flow...&nbsp;&nbsp; they want to minimize the flow.&nbsp; We could tell him what happened to Zahar.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're going in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaline tells the marquis they must speak.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline introduces herself as sometimes a marquis etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart says he's heard of what happened at oraculum to a bit...&nbsp;&nbsp; he's heard that there are demons and some sort of strange nexus there.&nbsp;&nbsp; We mention that Demogorgon controls it.&nbsp; We're hoping to gather forces to capture the city form the demons.<br /><br />Ironheart says that destroying an army of demons is a laudable goal.&nbsp;&nbsp; We say we lack the manpower.&nbsp; We mention that this new nexus can be refreshed at by all and such.&nbsp; We pusht he angle that the nexus in balance won't contribute to flow is good.&nbsp;&nbsp; And we need to make sure that the demons screw it up...&nbsp; and the delphians are interested as well.<br /><br />Ironheart says there is a certainty that the underworlders can survive on this.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then he says it'd be less of a concern to destroy their own.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately at this time there are issues that prevent us from providing military aid...&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a particular difficulty which is a constant threat to the empire, though it may not be if they keep getting their way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are familiar what happened in trimsaran, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; (It got ordered.)&nbsp;&nbsp; There were attacks elesehwere as I'm sure you're aware...&nbsp;&nbsp; it is a high prioroity for us to make these problems disappear.&nbsp; I mention that we believe that the ordering guy is in tatenda.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel is pretty sure the guy is still there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart says that the nexus being stable would free up the forces currently investigating and protecting against beardthicket.&nbsp; Apparently, they chased him away.&nbsp; Vshir got stabbed in the danglies and vows to return the favor to beardthicket.&nbsp; He was most recently seen at an underdark place trying to collapse two nexuses where we stopped him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart says he's been tough to pin down.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we resolve the ordering business, we could free up thte troops to take the city.&nbsp; Dariel says that last time he was in the city, there was a captain of a lineship that the former deva zahar knew and had saved multiple times... in that city, the delphians may have made ironwood to travel throught he ordering without the quaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel says he doesn't knwo the particulars...<br /><br />Ironheart nods. "Interesting that you speak of ironwood.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are familiar with this material and have used it in small quantities for weapon research.&nbsp;&nbsp; IUts possible what you say is true, that ironwood may stop the flow like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It so happens that until recently we had a sizeabl quantity of ironwood...&nbsp;&nbsp; but...&nbsp;&nbsp; It was in trymsarren when it was ordered.&nbsp; That was where all of their research was taking place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart says if we can retrieve the stores, the empire would be willing to donate it.&nbsp; The delphians may be able to get a small group in.&nbsp; <br /><br />The halfling teleporter is here.&nbsp; Ironheart says there's a slight change of plans.&nbsp; Dariel says we wish to go to Arx.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we get there, we'll give her a message and she'll return with that.&nbsp; <br /><br />We four go to arx, teleported by her.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a teleport, we're in arx.&nbsp; <br /><br />We go up to a guard and ask for captain belthiel.&nbsp; Isaline is looking for the people who signed the accord.&nbsp; they go to the same place which is the city hall within the plenipotentiaries office.&nbsp; We go there and request an audience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Balthiel will happilky talk to us with the guy looking into the nexus energy.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel is recognized by them.&nbsp; We say that were recently discussing with Ironheart Marquis.&nbsp; Say that the good news is that they have lots of ironwood.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad news is that its in an ordered city.&nbsp; They say that they might be able to coat a single man for it... a full suit of armor could work quite well to ward one person.&nbsp; All evidence suggests that Ironwood protects against the flow.&nbsp; We ask if they'd be willing to work with the Marquis.&nbsp; They ask what he wants, we tell them (Its pretty much the same.)&nbsp;&nbsp; We all agree that the ordering should stop, and oraculum should be taken.&nbsp; <br /><br />They theorize that the ironwood would need to cover the entire body.&nbsp; The guy writes a quick document, hands it to the halfling wizard and hands it to the guy.&nbsp; <br /><br />They say now that they should be able to have the armor crafted within a couple days.&nbsp; He says they have certain very capable individuals, the Marquis will know where the stockpile is.&nbsp; This guys says we're doing a great service to the empire and the delphians.&nbsp; Dariel says that if we do this, then the empire can contribute a lot of troopps to oraculum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel also says his elders will be sending messages to the fey to see if they can get some of the ironwood.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask about the research with balanced energy.&nbsp; it's progressing, though slowly.&nbsp; most of the tests that would ben productive will consume the small amounts they have.&nbsp; It has qualities of light and dark.&nbsp; <br /><br />The construction of the lineship is to be built for like 12 people.&nbsp; <br />Dariel says he'd like to check in on the others.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like simone.&nbsp; <br /><br />We get into a private area and get a plot dump from Dariel.&nbsp; He says they were going to Tatenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they got sidetracked.&nbsp; There were some problems with some memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arwen was supposed to go to tatenda, but came with us, but was not with us.&nbsp; He says that he was informed that there was a man called the vanquisher.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel never met him but he was told he has.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone informed them that the meeting never occured, but it didn't.&nbsp; She said it has been removed as a possibility.&nbsp; The second one we know of was the one with Arwel and whoever went with her to Tatenda.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was about to meet Calenon, but she was talking with him, and right after he said something, she was quaked to where they were, when she'd been there... and the possibility that she went to tatenda was removed from the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last part of this 10 day period.&nbsp;&nbsp; They went to the underdark, to Tane'klenya.&nbsp; They couldn't find any help there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second city they went to was the tiefling city.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said there was a problem with the qwarlocks and one called fiendgaze had to go to the other cioty with the little ones to stop a warlock insugency that they had broken apart, so they went ot the other cities to see what they could do.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some politics, but Dariel didn't understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they went to the other city, spoke with the magistrate, and spoke to Fiendgaze, leader of the warlocks.&nbsp;&nbsp; They convinced the magistrate and fiendgaze to go in and talk to the other warlocks to see why they were fighting...&nbsp;&nbsp; they were currently in a stalemate, they entered the tower.&nbsp; While they were in the palace, it seems that the individual the ebon priest and his patron chose to serve baalzebub instead of asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were going to talk to Baalzebub...&nbsp; <br /><br />Once they entered the place, something was wrong with the guards.&nbsp;&nbsp; When zahar, Simone, Ed, Arwel, and Dariel entered in, the two individuals removed their cowls.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ebon priest was one of the two emperors that was dead but not dead (Peacekeeper).&nbsp; The other one, the withered, was the first emperor , aka Baalzebub, the prince of lies.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're the same person (The first emperor became baalzebul, was hiding as the ebon priest).&nbsp;&nbsp; Something had happened within the hells where they became the same person.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Baal took over the college and the most recent emperor was with him.<br /><br />dariel says that he's not sure if the info the gorup was given was accurate... you know, Baal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guards were dwarves who were champions of Bahamut.&nbsp; (The champions of bahamut are the people who have been showing up around beardthicket.&nbsp; bahamut is really tiamat, so destroying the nexuses a la the commands of the recent emperor are dead.)&nbsp;&nbsp; They had issued to beardthicket the order to destroy inverted nexuses...&nbsp;&nbsp; We now know we can do something better now.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said they'd free up their forces to take over oraculum...&nbsp;&nbsp; they said if given a few days notice, they'll bring their warlocks to bear in the battle for oraculum.&nbsp; <br /><br />Baalzebuul is willing to work with us to depose Demogorgon.&nbsp; The motivating drive is that the flow is outside the hells and if the inverting of nexuses occurs, it'll create a hell on this plane, and they actually don't want that.&nbsp;&nbsp; They say that if this new nexus has potential, then good.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want to destroy the inverted nexuses now.&nbsp; <br /><br />The emperors have a point of contention...&nbsp;&nbsp; they want the inverted nexuses destroyed.&nbsp; During Dariel's scrying on calenon he determined he's outside of the flow.&nbsp; but this artifact points where the locater is.&nbsp; <br /><br />There was also an individual who had a problem with his eye.&nbsp; Simone was scrying on someone...&nbsp;&nbsp; beardthicket and his lassie?&nbsp; And they saw him go into a city pretending ot not be beardthicket.&nbsp; <br /><br />Another important interest:&nbsp;&nbsp; when bearthicket is doign waht he does there are more individuals there in some sort of invisibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; So while they had scared him away, someone else was completing the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp; They 'convinced' her to not finish the ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp; I.E. attacked her.&nbsp; Beardthicket was assaulted and fled.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's under the command of the emperors for now.&nbsp; <br /><br />The emperors are in contention because they believe they are doing is in line with the actual bahamut's path.&nbsp; The warlocks will be there to help.<br /><br />Dariel says they've got some theories.&nbsp;&nbsp; This prince of lies hates asmodeus.&nbsp; (All them hate Asmodeus, Levistus and Baalzebul hate him the most (Baal was turned into a slug.&nbsp; Levistus and moradin are eidolons.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one that doesn't hate asmodeus is Bel, just because Bel likes killing demons.&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't play the political game.&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe getting a host of devils to get a bunch of demons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could work.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only person to be on devcent terms with Asmodeus is the hag countess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who isn't supposed to be a lord of hell... she's 'something else'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mephistopheles doesn't mess with Asmodeus, because they have like a ceasefire, but if Meph saw an opening, he'd leap at it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're at a stalemate now)&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Demogorgon was an opportunist.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Asmodeus is using him as a distraction possibly.&nbsp; Dariel believes that Jonas/Calenon doesn't know that Asmodeus is the one giving him orders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel thinks that Calenon is acting way out of character.&nbsp; Soemthing happened to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; he discovered some sort of 'truth' and now he wants to stop the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; All evidence points to that making this plane a hell.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel says his druidic circle elders were a little surprised.&nbsp; That's the summary.&nbsp; Of the entire 10 days he was with us.&nbsp; he says he'll try to scry Simone.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is not in his reality currently.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're still in the flow, just 'too far to reach'.&nbsp; <br /><br />We sleep.&nbsp; This is the second day of my not needing to rest.&nbsp; Dariel has an owl.<br /><br />The halfling wizard appears in daves room.&rlm;onheart agreed to the terms, and they're going to give the info.&nbsp; The next day happens.&nbsp; I'll help plan the assault.&nbsp; <br /><br />We scry Seth (Isaline's husband.) It fails... no one there.&nbsp; I spend the afternoon talking to Benthiel.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's making changes to see that the thing is airtight, supplying a bottle of air for it, shaping the wood so it can't be breached.&nbsp; Sealing the ship and sending it in the right direction.&nbsp; The armor infiltration was done.&nbsp;&nbsp; The gnome pennywig believes its enough for the ship.&nbsp; reports are that the city looked like normal, but everyone was gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one was living there now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the armor worked, so the lineship should.&nbsp; Benethield says that the individual who returned expressed no concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some token resistance at the barrier itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are introduced to the guy.&nbsp;&nbsp; elven descent with some darkish skin... (Gray elf).&nbsp; He explains that he was sealed into the ironwood, given a spell to see form the helmet, describes his experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; He could hear pops in the air when things would change, but he felt not disorientation, passed through the barrier with minor difficulty, loaded everything up and left.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone abandoned that city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Talking to the high geomancer...&nbsp;&nbsp; he's constructing the ship.&nbsp; Asking about impestivous.&nbsp; Dariel says that he's interested in fixing the problem.&nbsp; <br /><br />I'm asked if I'm going.&nbsp; I say yeah, if they'll have me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Evening comes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Benthiel says the ship shoudl be ready in a day or so.&nbsp; He says Dariel wanted to go, and the rest of us...&nbsp; I dunno.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says we might be able to finish the lineship tonight.&nbsp; The plan is to leave tomorrow morning.&nbsp; Dariel tells teh circle.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />During the night there is a knock on the door of my room.&nbsp; The gnome engineer is at the door in a panic.&nbsp; I ask the porblem.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The lineships missing.'&nbsp; He's not sure...&nbsp;&nbsp; benthiels missing and vantara's missing and the crew's missing.&nbsp; he thinks they left.&nbsp; There was no way to move that lineship out of the building it was being built in.&nbsp; The plan was probably to teleport to it.&nbsp; We scry.&nbsp; <br /><br />The captain is in the lineship with ironwood armor, and he's under an enchantment.&nbsp; Its following a ley line.&nbsp; It's going a few MPH.&nbsp; <br /><br />we message him.&nbsp; Maybe he'll respond.&nbsp; We ask where he's going.&nbsp; In the cargo bay, severla heads turn that direction and he opens his mouth to say something and another voice says "You will be silent."&nbsp; Through the muffling we recognize cilius vartarus.&nbsp;&nbsp; The necromancer.&nbsp; At this point, the entire lineship is rocked and the scrying cuts out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel's scrying was cut because the guy left the flow.&nbsp; They almost certainly teleported to Tatenda.&nbsp; <br /><br />The teleportarer is contacted via a dream.&nbsp; She wakes up and gets to us about 2 hours later.&nbsp; We are telepprted there, and we notice the lineship sticking halfway into the ordering.&nbsp; It looks to have sustained some damage.&nbsp; The back has been b lown away...&nbsp; lightning bolt damage and luifted up and dropped a bit.&nbsp; <br /><br />The halfling wizard gives him something to scry her easier.&nbsp; <br /><br />From what we can see, the lineship seems ot be working as a tunnel.&nbsp; Isaline goes through without much trouble.&nbsp; Then I...&nbsp;&nbsp; we go through clear...&nbsp;&nbsp; no problem<br /><br />The entirety of tatenda is surrounded by a lightning storm.&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 people on the ground have been killed by lightning strikes.&nbsp; Dariel is aware of most of Calenon's tricks.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows he can tree stride, is good at scrying, he has rusting grasp.&nbsp; Speak with plants, can call down lightning, can use tree shape and hide from aniumals, obscuring mist, has some healing and buffing magic, and fights with a shilleleigh.&nbsp; This weather is part of a spell effect.&nbsp; Off in the distance we can see there are a few people clad in ironwood running around looking confused.&nbsp; Oh,a nd possibly he has eidolons with him at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; And considering this storm, there's probably a circle of him doing this.<br /><br />most of the soldiers that came here are alive, and seem to be fighting against the winds and rain, searching the bodies.&nbsp; They ironwooders are getting owned. <br />Dariel uses the artifact to locate him.&nbsp; <br /><br />There's another lightning strike behind a building, we hear "Dariel, what are you doing here."&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel: 'I am here on orders of the elders to determine what is going on.'<br /><br />"You aren't here with this traitor?"&nbsp; (Referring to Cilius).&nbsp; "There are others who talked to me and said my dreams could be made reality.&nbsp; Bartara and others.&nbsp; There's a bunch of shouting... flashes of fire.&nbsp; <br /><br />We D-Door thataways.&nbsp; We see another guy in ironwood armor.&nbsp;&nbsp; The helm is gone, its off to the side, steaming,..&nbsp;&nbsp; Bartara is there, he hurls a ball of fire and D doors away.&nbsp; He is in a panic but not under and enchantment.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel keeps talking and distracting the guy.&nbsp; 'We wanted to know why you were doing this.'&nbsp; "Busy!" 'Where is the one that betrayed you? I'll see if I can stop him from attacking you.'&nbsp; "It is good to know that his supposed allies see him for the fiend he is."&nbsp;&nbsp; Bartara gets hit by another figure and d doors away.&nbsp;&nbsp; The figure leaps into a building and tree strides through it&nbsp;&nbsp; The person with the quarterstaff is striking hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like, Ed hard...&nbsp;&nbsp; Greater vital strike.&nbsp; It becomes quickly apparent that Vartara is attempting to flee the city.&nbsp; (Cilius Bartara).&nbsp; They're playing cat and mouse...&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel's trying to intercept.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vartara is trying to get out, and will get out of the barrier hopefully.&nbsp; <br /><br />We See Calenon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaline sees a full grown green dragon...&nbsp;&nbsp; great wyrm.&nbsp; He is only partially here.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is partially real...&nbsp;&nbsp; but he is almost certainly real elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has control over his eidolons or their working together.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are warned now that its a dragon.&nbsp; <br /><br />We get the impression earlyu on that Calenon is extremely angry and he wants vartara dead, he wasn't lying, but that's all we get.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jesse makes a very hard decision of who to kill first.&nbsp; He decides to choose to smite Calenon...&nbsp;&nbsp; and the end decision is completely the wrong one and he misses.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has seen geomancy do this stuff.&nbsp; How all of the guys were getting 20s...&nbsp;&nbsp; is a specific effect.&nbsp; We'll all be rolling natural 1s against him.&nbsp; <br /><br />The effect can't last.&nbsp;&nbsp; I dispel the Calenon.&nbsp; And he ceases to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, IO dispelled that eidolon out of existence...&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask Cilius What happened.&nbsp; We isce storm...&nbsp;&nbsp; He's been geetting his shit rocked.&nbsp; <br /><br />We hear an echo "So, you have come to kill me after all."&nbsp; <br />Dariel Denies, but he says "You'll die with the shapeshifter."&nbsp; <br /><br />In order to attack of opportunity doing something that provokes an attack (Like tripping) you must not provoke an attack.&nbsp; <br /><br />So I let him go, Vshir attacks him.&nbsp; As Cilius passes through the ordering, we see his true form.&nbsp;&nbsp; A bizarre clearish liquid form..&nbsp;&nbsp; then he passes through and is gone.&nbsp; And we're standing there with an ice storm.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're heading in to the center of town.<br /><br />Dariel says he's here to talk, response is "I have very little to talk to anyone about."&nbsp; Calenon is willing to talk a bit as Dariel offers conversation.&nbsp; Dariel mentions he believes Asmodeus is using Calenon as a pawn to turn the world into a hell.&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon says there are other planes that are outside of the flow.&nbsp; Dariel says he thinks Calenon is being duped.&nbsp; There's a pause as thunder continues to roll.&nbsp;&nbsp; he replies "What evidence do you have of this accusation."&nbsp; 'I was recently in the underdark area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the information came form someone I can't completely trust, but it fits with what I've found out.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only reason I'd trust this information is because he and asmodeus vie against eachother...&nbsp;&nbsp; it is the prince of lies.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wish for you to havbe all the possible information there is.'<br /><br />"Even should I believe you, evenm should the ordering cease, what then." 'If you believe you've been duped, would you work with us against the one doing it.'&nbsp; <br />We ask if he wants this plane to be removed from the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because he believes it is best for everyone.&nbsp; THere's more information...&nbsp;&nbsp; It could have lead to what happened at oraculum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know of this. ?<br /><br />"There has been a disturbance.&nbsp;&nbsp; something we have not seen for some time."&nbsp;&nbsp; Closer to what nature once was (Correcting Dariel saying 'what nature should be.')&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel says he believes that if we look down this path there may be a path where both of them can be right. <br /><br />Calenon seems contemplative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel says "i don't know how much you understand asmodeus is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Either he's duping you or he's using what you're doing to become more powerful."&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention its happened...&nbsp;&nbsp; that other worlds have been made into hells after the removal of flow.&nbsp; <br /><br />'I will need an explanation for how you know these things and how you can believe anything you've heard is true. Allow me to offer some insight.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am well aware that I do not serve asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Asmodeus has this power and I do as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not power given to me, I saw it and emulated it.&nbsp; So we say that Calenon may be a 3rd or 4th party involved here.&nbsp; <br /><br />'Though the ordering may seem chaotic, if all nexuses are ordered, the flow will stop.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon does not believe that the orderings were done at the behest of asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask if he's probably using that opportunity.&nbsp; We say that Asmodeus' plans in this world are far greater than we can imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenon says "Even if asmodeus took advantage of the circumstances to learn how to erode the past, I have learned how to do the same thing in the short past.'<br /><br />Dariel says we need to look into Oraculum.&nbsp; And we might ocme at a head, because Calenon will want to order every nexus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon says the ordering is a new technique<br /><br />Calenon says that they were not responsible for the plague.&nbsp; IT could have been relieved form a dark nexus.&nbsp; Regardless of Calenon's effort, stop him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Asmodeus has planes, You have a city.&nbsp; <br /><br />'Nevertheless, it would be difficult for anyone to challenge me here.'&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline asks if he'll be able to hold the rest of the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon says that the past can be eroded.&nbsp; Dariel knows this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenon says he hasn't effected Dariel directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel says one was when you were tangentially involved.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dariel removed Arwel's having done the journey into Tatenda.&nbsp; <br /><br />We get the impression that the reason that vartara was effected by the barrier was because he wasn't fully encased in ironwood.&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone were fully encased in ironwood, they might be protected from whatever Calenon is doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; or if they're wielding an ironwood weapon.&nbsp; Dariel is the only one who gets that last bit.&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon is moving...&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot<br /><br />Isaline asks about his true form.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one that's not an elf.<br /><br />Calenon comes into sight as a green great wyrm.&nbsp;&nbsp; he'll land out in the open.&nbsp;&nbsp; he's watching Dariel.&nbsp; Dariel... "well, I knew that we lived a long time but not as long as you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could have been an elf and the result would be the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been others who've lived as long as I have, All of the elders who neared that level of power were assigned to other families."&nbsp; 'You ruled/guided us for a long time...'<br /><br />"Uninvolvement was the best way until recently.&nbsp; "&nbsp; 'How long have you had this plan?' "These thougths have existed for several centuries now.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea of being free from the flow. "&nbsp; 'I remember the beginnings'<br /><br />(I pass along the info about the ironwood armor and such.)&nbsp; Isaline is suiting up in ironwood.&nbsp;&nbsp; She grabs the ironwood longsword as well, but porbably won't try to use it right away.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vshir does so as well.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel whispers to his owl that the owl should tell us to use ironwood weapons.<br /><br /><br />Isaline gets some of the ironwood armor on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The owl passes on this info.&nbsp; We look around for some weapons.&nbsp; Isaline finds a bastard sword.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel asks if Calenon thinks its a possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says its something he wouldn't lightly go into.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenon says that sure, but he's got his courese... and he wouldn't be so set in it if he knew of another way.&nbsp; Dariel says that unfortunately the individual.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vartara will be suffering for a long time.. he and his group are the reason for all of this (says calenon)&nbsp;&nbsp; It is certain they intended to use this for very questionable purposes.&nbsp; They know... too much, and may well be working with asmodeus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon is very set on his course, but our speaking does intrigue him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is firmly of the belief that he is not working for asmodeus and is intrinsically opposed to asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; but if we brought proof he'd be willing to listen. <br /><br />Nobody ever says they thought he was evil.&nbsp; Dariel says that he needs to the discuss with the other elders.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenon says that he brought them all together. <br />Calenon says he will not prevent Dariel from leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />At this point we're all armed and armored.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel says he'll return.&nbsp; Calenon says "Very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will leave the lineship in place for a time so you do not need to risk yourself."<br /><br />Dariel walks towards us.&nbsp; <br /><br />I buff us...&nbsp;&nbsp; THe mission starts.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We attack one image, damage him, and its gone.&nbsp; Dariel drops into the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />isaline makes 7 reflex saves against the lightning bolts.&nbsp; (DC 27).&nbsp; He doesn't care about them because of the electricity.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vshir goes invisible.&nbsp; <br /><br />My triggered D door goes off.&nbsp; I move away.&nbsp; The seven dragons come.&nbsp; (they're gargantuan.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline gets really greater vital striked.&nbsp; (75 damage).&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel uses his Calenon finder.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knows the direction.&nbsp; he's called more.&nbsp; <br /><br />We see seven duplicates descend below the building height.&nbsp; When they move, they become difficult to pinpoint.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when they moved this last time, they shimmer and there's a lot of wind and dust and stuff... while moveing they have concealment.&nbsp; <br />(lightning stance).&nbsp; <br /><br />They hid themselves behind buildings.&nbsp; There is fog all over the place back there too.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;We hear Calenon's voice "You have improved beyond I've expected and you've brought very powerful allies.&nbsp; (We have a sense that his resolve is fading.&nbsp;&nbsp; He doesn't really want to continue fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp; We get the impression that he's preparing to stall for time if he has to but he's also willin gto really listen now.&nbsp;&nbsp; He does not think in his current condition he could continue fighting for much longer.)<br /><br />We say that basically we need him to discontinue his orderings.&nbsp;&nbsp; And say that he should his abilities to bear against asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says you wish for me to order no more nexuses until.&nbsp; Once we show you the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says he is willing to stop ordering nexuses for a year or until he is shown proof.&nbsp;&nbsp; We say that after a year is up or we show him, he's released.&nbsp; <br /><br />He says "We can agree asmodeus is an enemy to all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can agree to not order any more nexuses and prevent my minions from doing so as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no intention of going back into the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can bring me convincing proof of any kind, then I will cease ordering nexuses and simply remain here. <br /><br />While he is not necessarily dead set on dying for most of his beliefs, he would rather die than return to the flow, and he believes we couldn't undo the nexus ordering in any case.&nbsp; <br /><br />He says, 'alternatively, find me another place that doesn't suffer from the flow. I am willing to accept that the hells are immune to the flow.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaline: "I don't know if you remember the humans or when they were destroyed."&nbsp; He says that he wants a place that we can take him that has no flow and is not a hell.&nbsp; He offers us a year to do this, during which he will prevent nexuses from being ordered.&nbsp; He submits to a mark of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I tell the wizard halfling to teleport and get ironheart's trusted men so we can get the dragons oath heard by some of his men.&nbsp; She reappears, and ironheart is with her.&nbsp; asks me to explain the situation.<br /><br />I take him through the lineship.&nbsp; He walks through as well.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We return.&nbsp; isaline will be binding the oath and applying the mark.&nbsp; <br /><br />He wanted to meet isaline by the nexus.&nbsp; Calenon says that if there is a truce being called.&nbsp; we approach.&nbsp; We reach the outskirts of the nexus and we can see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has a very subdued glow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a light nexus.&nbsp; it lacks the brightness that a normal white nexus should have...&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not any less there than it shoudl be but its dimmer.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br />Calenon is waiting there in elven form.&nbsp; And&nbsp; not split or anything.&nbsp; Ironheart says 'let us state the terms on which we are going to form this pact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaline will be arbitrating by placing the oath.'<br /><br />"He will stop ordering attacks, not order order attacks, and will prevent his followers from doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Should we provide evidence that doing so is aiding Asmodeus, he will not order again.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will also not order nexuses again if we can find him a place to live without the flow which is not a hell."&nbsp; <br /><br />In addition, should you provide evidence that these balanced nexuses negate the flow, I will accept that route as well.<br /><br />Calenon is agreeign to the oath without the intent to circumvent it.<br /><br />Calenon gets an iodd look on his face, and looks at Dariel oddly... he looks very confused.&nbsp;&nbsp; He turns back into a dragon and his scales because a burnished, very reflective green.&nbsp; he is no longer a green dragon.&nbsp;&nbsp; (There are legends of metallic dragons but no ones ever met them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They supposidly existed once.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bahamut is a platinum, the only one.&nbsp; There are also gem dragons...&nbsp;&nbsp; the nomads had pacts with emerald dragons.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Calenon just turned into one.)<br /><br />Calenon says "This is a more familiar form."&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask if he was changed away form emerald. "I had been for several centuries..."&nbsp; 'Did the orbs change hands?' "One of them must have."&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Calenon says he feels he has regained a certain amount of perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Our people must truly have been desperate to send forth for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wish to maintain this pact, however it is unlikely I would be unlikely to pursue these."&nbsp; Ironheart says saying this on Bahamuts word would happen.&nbsp; <br /><br />We say that now its happened twice now in the past 600 years...&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenon agrees to the oath and mark regardless.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />he says the flow has become more of a dangerous entity of late.&nbsp;&nbsp; for the past few centuries, things have been transpiring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Del[phians and empire have changed the nexuses...&nbsp; they are bringing about a very unfortunate end.&nbsp; it is an unfortunate thing taht the world bmust be changed in this way, but if the flow itself has become this way, perhaps it is better to simply end it and prevent its further abuse... this is hte chain of thought that led me to this course of actions.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dariel asks that Calenon speak with the elders.&nbsp;&nbsp; calenon Agrees willingly.&nbsp; Even going so far as to leave his hidey hole.&nbsp; calenon agrees to 10 years instead of 1 year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Calenon says that should we find a solution to the problems that plague the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only by returning the flow to the pure state coudl the ordering come to an end.&nbsp; <br /><br />We agree with 10 years.&nbsp; We do the mark of justice, he swears that oath to Bahamut (Under Ironheart.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon says he will probably just scry upon the elders to speak with them.<br /><br />Calenon says we should discuss the matter of attacking oraculum himself to an extent.&nbsp; Calenon and Dariel have a chat about what Calenon's been up to for so long.&nbsp; He will also uses Tatenda as a scrying mirror...&nbsp; The elders are surprised to talk to him at all..&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain that he underwent a transformation.&nbsp; a few elders seem to have understood and are happy to see he's no longer that way anymore.&nbsp; <br /><br />calenon basically asserts that basically if there was ever a time for the nomads to change the world, it would be to protect the balanced nexus, since that's how the nexuses were and should be.<br /><br />Calenon will be in here.&nbsp;&nbsp; dariel asks that he be able to speak to him.&nbsp; Calenon discusses with Dariel about how maybe he could scry through the ordering.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gives a scale to Dariel and says that will suffice.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart promises to start mobilizing an army.&nbsp; The captain of the lineship is alive but unconscious.&nbsp; (Isaline shows ironheart the accord, and Ironheart is willing to agree to those.&nbsp; Isaline wants to be commisioned back... Ironheart says its possible...&nbsp;&nbsp; isaline did a good job.&nbsp; Ironheart says that protecting the cities aren't fully necessary, so most of the troops can be mobilized in fairly short order.&nbsp; <br /><br />We bring back as much of the ironwood as possible to arx.&nbsp; <br /><br />The captain is furious when I awaken him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He starts cussing.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's pissed he was controlled.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask Calenon what happened to cilius. "As I said before, the nexuses will, when ordered, take many possible realities and condense them into one.&nbsp; One side effect of this is that since none of these realities had not been condensed outside a certain point they would all comingle.&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads to more quakes near the outer zone...&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that the closer one comes to the ordering itself the more quakes change things, and then they pass through the barrier and experience all realities simultaneously... the effects on one's psyche and even soul would be profound.&nbsp; (Ironheart looks a bit horrified at this prosepct.)&nbsp; Calenon says that isaline might not be effected because she's singular.&nbsp; He says that if she does so he would be interested in the results.&nbsp; Should it be possible to order all nexuses in the world, each reality would become singular...&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not entirely certain that the ordering as it currently stands would do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; My theory under which I began the ordering process, I bnelieves that each reality would become a mirror plane. A nearly infinite number of these planes that existed simultaneously.&nbsp; each free of this corruption of the flow that's been happening for so long.<br /><br />calenon says the orbs are singular, so...&nbsp;&nbsp; the priests of tiamat are now the aspects of Io.<br /><br />(He says he will proibably not be of copper skin again for a long time, its been a long long time since he has been.&nbsp; It is my understanding that in the past, asmodeus obtained one of the orbs, since then, I've been as you see and have seen me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Asmodeus moves.)&nbsp; <br /><br />So He has made many states one state.&nbsp; He has the ability to call other copies of himself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Humans are another of the cursed races.&nbsp; says calenon.&nbsp; He only knows the stories that have been passed down.&nbsp; <br /><br />Calenon says that if we go to fight asmodeus he could <br /><br />Dragontamer's white dragon has the orb...&nbsp;&nbsp; well, now its not a white dragon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Demogorgon has the crown and the wand.&nbsp; Siomone decides to talk to demogorgon to like shoot himself in the other head...&nbsp;&nbsp; Demogorgons like don't make me go over there.&nbsp; </p>
