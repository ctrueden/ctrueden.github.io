      <p>With the end of the council we have the whole of the world aiding us against the demons. &nbsp;We have been given access to powerful artifacts, and Tomes. &nbsp;I studied several tomes that have detailed methods to improve my strength greatly. &nbsp;The rituals took several weeks, but I can feel the energies rushing through me. &nbsp;I have prepared as best I can for this fight, and Anne regained her corporeal form. &nbsp;This is going to be a fight none have seen since the&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;of the world.</p><p>I have also&nbsp;procured&nbsp;items that will allow me to teleport. &nbsp;Being one of the stronger mages in this group, I must be able to travel around the battlefield. &nbsp;Anne has been preparing as well.</p><p>I care little about the politics I must admit, which is why I kept quiet during the proceedings. &nbsp;I did aid the Dragons by restoring the energy taken from the now Crystal dragon. &nbsp;I took some energy donated from others, hopefully it might make the difference. &nbsp;The dragons seemed grateful for the service. &nbsp;It has allowed me to further study the dragons.</p><p>I pray we make it through this, I owe it to the Raven Queen to aid her. &nbsp;I dislike the structure of this world, its flow disrupts things. &nbsp;We are living off the lifeforce of a god, and it is not a healthy world. &nbsp;I wish to balance all the nexi of the world, and restore a natural balance.</p>

      <p><br />5/29/2010<br /><br />The war council...&nbsp;&nbsp; lots and lots of NPCs.&nbsp; <br /><br />The following morning after the assasinations, we have 5 days to tlak to whoever before the war council.&nbsp; Vshir and Isalkine recieved sendings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vshir responds to the sending with WTH is going on: The world is entering a time of great change.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your actions will effect what is going to happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; and Isaline asks what her destiny is.&nbsp; :The Raven queen seeks to use you as a tool of unprecedented change.&nbsp;&nbsp; but beware; her course of action -could- be the end of everything.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Remember, this city is totally domed.&nbsp;&nbsp; its in the NW section of the wastes.&nbsp; it looks fairly impregnable.&nbsp; When they walk up to the wall, the wall opens...&nbsp;&nbsp; the gatekeeper has a list.&nbsp; )&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><a href="http://restlessgamer.net/eidolons/war-council" title="http://restlessgamer.net/eidolons/war-council">http://restlessgamer.net/eidolons/war-council</a><br /><br />Has the participants<br /><br />Admatha is sitting with Derris Roll, but is wearing the tabard of the common shield.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar goes to question Ehlonna;&nbsp;&nbsp; who would try to kill her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they have any number of enemies,. not all fo them get along, it could have been a priest of one of the gods not representerd in this council..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agents of demogorgon, There are too many possibilities to give a guess...&nbsp;&nbsp; She was warned by Ioun of the attack, but not who was involved.&nbsp; Zahar says that they'll try again, proabbly, she says that prophecy is not always so clear...&nbsp; in other places the assailants directions were significant.&nbsp; She says that we have been more in the thick of it than the gods...&nbsp;&nbsp; Zhahar says its tough to say... he wouldn't expect anyone to make teh attempt..&nbsp;&nbsp; a great deal of her invovlement or that of her peers she doesn't really know of.&nbsp; She says she doesn't suspect any of the factions present at the council.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar mentions issues with the underdark...&nbsp; their representative is not darros roll..But DSarros rolls is here, and it was his mistress who made an assassination attempt against her...&nbsp;&nbsp; the peace of this summit has already been violated.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eholnna says that there were attempts on delphian citizens and other underdarkers doesn't mean that they aren't interested in these talks.&nbsp;&nbsp; She can only imagine that the hordes will not lose their representation because one of their tribes attacked the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar talks to admatha;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darres Roll is still representing tateclenya.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admatha spoke to him at some length; she spent some time trying to talk to him...&nbsp;&nbsp; he's a wizard of some repute (Zahar says he's also a serpent)&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that he's houseless; not of noble birth, so most of his life has been working for whichever noble hoiuse would take him.&nbsp;&nbsp; the first time he was encountered by admatha he had been hired to teleport some people to arx and to help her deal with an enemy of her house, he didn't care who it was at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the way of that city.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't bear him ill will for having been hired to do that job since he wasn't here for that.&nbsp;&nbsp; He will act in the best interests of the underdark and is here to attempt to actually make the treaty work/.&nbsp; She believes that his interests are the interests of the underdark, so its ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; As much as anyone can say that he's working for the greater good...&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar is worried that demogorgon would recruit Derros.&nbsp; Zahar really really doesn't trust that jerk...&nbsp;&nbsp; and he appears to be working for a different master each time...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, Ioun did invite him, but...<br /><br />Admatha admits Derros is an opportunist who is gooda t moving up the food chain in a city where not being a noble makes it very difficult to ever succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is a skilled wizard from her understanding.&nbsp; He is currently the acting magistrate.. and he'll probably end up as a permanent magistrate if he ends up well here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar asks if he know of the assassination attempt on admatha before it happened.&nbsp; Zahar says we should have a secondary plan if we're relying on him, because Darros will.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vashir's father regained noble house status in tateclenya.&nbsp; Vashir will probably&nbsp; go with them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Everyone is coming as themselves.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Simone gathers info around with our help.&nbsp;&nbsp; we get all the names of these people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Each faction's goals/concerns, etc. (They make a formal note of this during the council, but here it is)<br />(There's grumbling about why some factions have a faction... like, why does fochlucan have its own, instead of beign an independent..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently Ioun just said these are the factions and people, Erathis said this is the layout... there wasn't really discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of people don't even&nbsp; know who the champions of bahmut are)<br /><br />Delphia:&nbsp; They're a broken nation in big trouble, one city smashed, one ordered, one taken by demons, leaving only 3 more cities functional.&nbsp; they want to liberate oraculum not jsut cause its one of their cities, but they feel personal responsibility and feel kinda guilty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Erathis is their leader...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Erathis has been active in Factum for a few months, is the goddess of technology...&nbsp; (Ioun was also active around here.)&nbsp;&nbsp; They've been doing something ehre at factum...&nbsp; Some secret project they were doing,t he nature of which no one knwos...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people speculate its the flying city, but maybe there's more.&nbsp; <br />(Kasian and Isaline are botht he Marquis of Elyria). As far as erathis is concerned, we managed to track her down...&nbsp;&nbsp; she's a very odd looking figure.&nbsp;&nbsp; looks almost half soulforged.&nbsp;&nbsp; she's got a mechanical arm and leg and one side of her face...&nbsp;&nbsp; circuitry along that side...&nbsp;&nbsp; when she moves, her body kinda adjusts..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; she reaches out to get a glass in a totally unnatural way.&nbsp;&nbsp; The others here are the plenipotentiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sewyn, imptempestivous plenipotentiary isn't here...&nbsp;&nbsp; he hasn't been seen since the ordering of his town.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last is a noble from arx (Gwen's mom).<br /><br />Champions of Bahamut: Dardenos is here, a dwarf named dregnar, who is a general of the champions of bahamut is with him.&nbsp; Notably missing kinda sorta is beardthicket.&nbsp;&nbsp; they believe they're doing bahamuts will, the inverted nexuses are anathema, and must be collapsed.&nbsp; They're here because they elarened Dardenos seems strongly behind this liberation.&nbsp; He seems convinced the balanced energy is the way forward.<br /><br />Warlocks of ebon priest... lotsa people are like ebon priest what?&nbsp; But we know he's Baalzebul or the like...&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe he's an eidolon or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; We learn the warlocks have split into three factions; red, black, and gray.&nbsp;&nbsp; red loyal to underdark pledged to fiends, black fporswore their oaths to the fiends and is now under baalzebul.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gray... somethings funny about them. they voided their contracts, and now claim to serve only themselves.&nbsp; the gray claim this is what they've done...&nbsp;&nbsp; apparently there's somet price they have to pay to do this.. the sactions for the violations of the pact vary person to person.&nbsp;&nbsp; baalzebul is opposed to the hells and hates Asmodeus.&nbsp; He's made it his lifes mission to take down Asmodeus.&nbsp; (The gray representative here is notably an oni)<br /><br />Nomadic tribes: Few people are here, which is strange.&nbsp; the warrior with the gray render bound to him is here (Daermethor...)&nbsp;&nbsp; the gray render wasn't allowed into the war council.&nbsp; Another leader is here as well... Dariel is notably missing.&nbsp; There's no representative of several of them...&nbsp;&nbsp; Eraja is a notable absence for giernon.&nbsp; rumor going around is that something happened to some of these leaders..&nbsp;&nbsp; some were undecided or against it, but something more is going on with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very diverse, but they believe anything is possible with the flow, so they want to preserve it...&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a lot of resistance on their part of being here, but a number have been convinced to be here, but its hard to say if they're unified because so many missing.<br /><br />Fey court:&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna is representing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; suppposedly she's claiming to be the daughter of oberon and titania.&nbsp; Yin and Yang are pixie twins here as her aids...&nbsp;&nbsp; presumably have some sway in the coiurt.&nbsp; No one knows their purpose...&nbsp; they're... probably here to help...?<br /><br />Tribal hordes:&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanquisher is here, but doesn't claim to speak for the hordes, claims to be here on his own power...&nbsp;&nbsp; The goblin priestess that vanquisher was talking to is here.&nbsp; The other tribal leaders are absent.&nbsp; But there's some muttering that one of those tribes is one of the ones that attacked the city (The bloody thunder tribe did).&nbsp;&nbsp; None of the other leaders were even on the list.&nbsp; Vanquisher says he doesn't claim to speak for the thunder tribe...&nbsp;&nbsp; worked with them once...&nbsp; he says he doubts many of them survived Kord's assault.&nbsp; The vanquisher likes killing stuff, especially demons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there's something funny abotu him with the fey.&nbsp;&nbsp; he seems ot have some sort of relationship with them...&nbsp;&nbsp; (Remember, he was an Oni once).&nbsp; when the platipods attacked his own troops at terminus after he sacked it, he just withdrew, he was like we're going, we're leaving, now.&nbsp; He never personally fought, but his people did.&nbsp; <br /><br />The empire:&nbsp; Ironheart is here as the marquis of valhalla representing the regent.&nbsp; the other marquis are here.&nbsp;&nbsp; the regent is not here (Dragontamer is not here.)&nbsp; Two master trainers of the Norns are here.&nbsp; they want to make sure the underdark peoples don't become extinct.&nbsp; Also dragontamer pledged his assitance for a service that was done.&nbsp; We all know why they're there.&nbsp; Just note that these are the most purely loyal status quo people.&nbsp;&nbsp; notably, no priests of Io/bahamut/tiamat here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Underdark faction:&nbsp; they're not a unified force, but there's a status quo and ruling magistrate in each of the two cities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jason's character has gone missing, acting in his place is Darros roll, and the other magistrate is there...&nbsp;&nbsp; Vashir's father is here and fiendgaze is here.&nbsp; They're scared... they don't have many people and are worried about being wiped out...&nbsp;&nbsp; their nexuses are being forcibly collapsed...&nbsp;&nbsp; so they really want to see their [people safe...&nbsp;&nbsp; and perhaps this energy at oraculum might save them.&nbsp; Not a lot of love for the party from balthazar.&nbsp; <br /><br />Io faction:&nbsp; two of the high priests/aspects are here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Erynion (The patience, green).&nbsp;&nbsp; Has no comment of the empire Tiamat/Io/bahamut thing.&nbsp; Algos is blue, the might.&nbsp; Eyrnion claims she's here to help in this effort because its in Io's best interests... he wants it.&nbsp; Algos hates politics and its sorta strange he's here, but its a war council... he wants to make sure we don't fuck it up, basically.<br /><br />Independents:&nbsp;&nbsp; Free cities have their own things., avandra the goddess represents them ebcause its easier for them to get behind her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She won't speak unequivicolly , will seek advice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Order of the common shield is represented by... me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tatenda is not represented.&nbsp; They jsut want a say with oraculunm... won't pledge troops, but yeah, they still want to talk<br /><br />fochlucan:&nbsp;&nbsp; She is here and representing them... no one else is here...&nbsp;&nbsp; She gets her own stand.&nbsp; conspiracy theories are already floaing around.&nbsp;&nbsp; They want their hands in all the pies.<br /><br />Kord:&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord's here.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We also learn a moderator has been appointed, so the moderator can declare and enforce order in the court.&nbsp; People hope its not Kord.<br /><br /><br /><br />erathis is confident in our future success.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Council proper beings!<br /><br />Erathis says "With all your cooperation, a few opening remarks.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few have quesitons what's been going on recently regarding hte skyline and such,.&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks for agreeing to attend.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say some words about how I hope through our cooperation we will be successful, but I know this to be true already, so let's move on.&nbsp; In the last few days most of you have done your research as to whos here and why, afte rmy remarks.&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the incident at the skyline.&nbsp; There was an attack form onbe of the tribal hordes on this s=city... they managed to breach the wall using desctrutive magic.&nbsp;&nbsp; they were working under the explicit instructions of those associtated with the hordes...&nbsp;&nbsp; Bane, Erythnul, Gruumsh.&nbsp;&nbsp; it is not surprising that they by their natures oppose this type of effort though I am still disappointed.&nbsp;&nbsp; they did to harm to teh city but it is nothign that can't be fixed in the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; many of you have speculated ont he reasons for our liftoff... that was earlier than expected, but it was in response to the attack, and we were far enough along with that projhect that we will be stable in the air for the next 30 days at least.&nbsp; w e are making our way to oraculum for a direct assault on the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; this is Delphias contribution to the war effort, and is what ioun and I have been working on.&nbsp; We can discuss the specifics of the capabilities later.&nbsp;&nbsp; Know that the full might of delphian technomagic is behind htis effort.&nbsp; There was also an assault on the skuling but we believe it to be coincidental, and loss of like was minimal.&nbsp; Ehlonna was targeted, but wasn't even able to be engaged, because *mentions the PCS*&nbsp;&nbsp; stopped them.&nbsp; Factum thanks you for stopping them.&nbsp;&nbsp; please know that a number of security efforts have been put into play... no one can teleport in, no one can scry, and we're flying, so people can't enter the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is permitted to teleport within the city and to leave in that fashion, but returning would be difficult, so if you msut leave, speak with me.&nbsp; I would ask that each of us give a status report on our respective nations.&nbsp;&nbsp; and I would caution you that now is not the time for secrecy.&nbsp; After introductions, I will begin with delphia."<br /><br />She then goes through and introduces everyone with titles.&nbsp; Kas's title "Representative of St. Cuthbert."&nbsp; <br /><br />"now that we've all been introduced, I will comment on the situation ehre in Delphia.&nbsp; three of our cities have been decimated..." explains.&nbsp; No refugees from imp.&nbsp; NOBODY was there at the ordering and escaped.&nbsp; Reports on orcaulum... after grazzt move there, mentions how the nexuses were combined, says some among you were able to create a new kind of nexus energy,m with teh leadership of eraja, since that incident she has been missing as have some others.&nbsp; Simultaneously, the minions of demogorgon were able to usurp power from grazzt while grazzt himself was quickly defeated by the raven queen.&nbsp; She notably drops the topic of the raven queen quickly.&nbsp; she says that we have a number of soulforged made for war...&nbsp;&nbsp; (Solicitus is the main factory of them).&nbsp;&nbsp; Solicitus has been producin warforged in preparation for this effort but it has become clear what they're used for.&nbsp; one more thing to mention before others give their status reprots.&nbsp; you may think it odd that some of us are present here as avatars, but others have not.&nbsp;&nbsp; rest assured you have the support of many others, but a task has occupied many of them.&nbsp; (one of the four gods here is not like the other; Kord, and not just because he's male.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is not in the wall at the temple of sigil.)<br /><br />"With that, I conclude my opening remarks, and invite each of you at this table to report on our nations status to the best of yoru ability.&nbsp;&nbsp; we will all trust in each of your judgements to give all relevent information, but don't mean to pry into irrelevant things."&nbsp; <br /><br />They all go around the circle and do so.&nbsp; Most of this we've gathered already.<br /><br />Peacekeeper says its bahamut's will to liberate oraculum, and the new nexus is thje future of our world, i have no doubt in my mind and as such I will pledge our full resources.&nbsp;&nbsp; my people have been engaged within the empire (Cue imperial grumbling, Fiendgaze stares daggers.&nbsp; one speaks loudly:&nbsp;&nbsp; 'how can you say you've pledged your full support when your lackey is still violently assaulting us and destroying our way of life.) peacekeeper pauses for a moment, then says 'the champions are indeed no longer engaged in this effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; they are, to a man, here, preparing for this effort.&nbsp;&nbsp; what beardthicket does is... without any assistance from me until oraculum is liberated...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the best I can promise you.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ebon priests:&nbsp;&nbsp; Baalzebul speaks up: "We know full well what a risk is posed to this world.&nbsp;&nbsp; it is our intention to offer the assistance of those warlocks who have not ocntinued to side with the underdark at large, for the liberation of this nexus for all those who have made such pacts, despite our differences in philosophy. *head turns to fiendgaze.*&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that he's got the fly eyes...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Daermithor: It has been the intention of my people to avoid interference in such things as would bring about this sort of calamity, but it seems despite all of our actions and inactions, taht cataclysm is coming about and we have pledged our factiosn to help.&nbsp;&nbsp; as for the nexus, its a wellspring of potential and it should be saved, bnut our purpose here is to prevent demogorgon from using this power to defeat the world.&nbsp; Terithial stands and says "It is regrettable i am the only one present to stand for the other tribes.&nbsp;&nbsp; there have been disappearances of late.&nbsp; more and more of our tribesmen have gone into the flow and not come back out.&nbsp;&nbsp; at first we thought it was just hte flow but there is reason to believe there is a mroe malignant force is at work, as all the leaders of the other tribes have been reported missing iwthing the past two months.&nbsp;&nbsp; it is possible that what we are fearing is already coming to pass, so I stress the urgency of this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna: "As has been already stated, the gods are by and large in support of the plan being made here, but there are a few dissenting of course, as would be expected.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have come to offer the services of the fey in whatever way we may do so... and we feel this is a very improtant siotuation...&nbsp; things we would not reasonably do, perhaps we should consider *looks tot he faction leaders.*&nbsp; <br /><br />Vanquisher:&nbsp;&nbsp; At various times I have gone to war against most of the people in this room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like it to be clear that my top priority and those of my troops is the liberation of oraculum and the destruction of the demons.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ironheart:&nbsp; "I wish for it to be clear that our people have no use for those nexuses, save for those given to the underdark people... We have been told that this oraculum nexus will allow them to be saved, and because thsould there be some other method to prevent us from experiencing the flow, we are open to this idea and the experimentationt hat would go alogn with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our forces are pledged to secure the city, after which time we will have little interest in it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Balthazar:&nbsp; Kinda smirks, looks like he's amused to be in this situation.&nbsp; "Quite the absurd situation we've all found ourselves in but these are dire times, especially for my people.&nbsp;&nbsp; We pretend not that we are doing well, our source of life is being viciously targeted and it will result in our destruction unless we find another way to surivve.&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why were'&nbsp; here... manny of our greatest assets have turned away form us, but we still offer the warriors of the hell fist and our remaining warlocks.&nbsp; I am glad to see the concession of peacekeeper that his troops are no longer actively working to destroy the empeire nexuses, so some of my troops have been moved back ehre, but only if the source of the destruction came and pledged cessation could I move the rest.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erynion: serenly stands....&nbsp; has an aura of unflappability, serenity.&nbsp; "Alagos and I are here in part due to an agreement made to some of you, but more importantly nbecause Io views it to be in his best interest to see this city liberated.&nbsp; with Erathis' help we've been able to shield this entire city from scrying through my power as a priestess of Io.&nbsp;&nbsp; this is our initial contribution but rest assured we will be fighting with our full force during hte battle.&nbsp; *Algos grins*&nbsp;&nbsp; Other than that we can only seek to guide and advise you all to make good decisions.&nbsp; THose of you familiar with the lore of dragons might know that things have recently changed for us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Io is back in balance, what that means is complicated, but we seek no harm among you, and you can count dragonkind among your allies, at least for the time being.<br /><br />Avandra:&nbsp; Slightly impatient...&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm here because there was no one better to speak for the free cities and other independents,.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't claim to unequivocally speak for all of them, so I'll listen to all the people behind me, and we will present a unified front to ensure we recieve our representation.&nbsp;&nbsp; it is crucial that the free cities not be forgotten and that oraculum not fall to the larger forces here today.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose that is all i will sa for now as each of the free cities is distinctly situated and mostly irrelevent.<br /><br />Fochlucan:&nbsp; "I know many of you are wondering why I'm here in this position.&nbsp; I 'm wondering myself, but it is true my people founded an independent city *muttering form independents*&nbsp;&nbsp; All I know is what I've been told.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spoke briefly to Ioun when he spoke briefly to me, and he said Fochlucan is its own faction and that its in our best interests for it to be this way.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will do my best to be a voice of moderation in this council.&nbsp;&nbsp; I assure you my people do not have a strong, radical agenda.&nbsp; I seek only what is best for the world.&nbsp; My people, such as they are... the handful over whom i have authority are already working to infiltrate oraculum to perform reconnaisance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope to hear back form them soon and hope it will aid in this council's planning.<br /><br /><br />((Isaline and Vashir choose kord for their blessing.&nbsp; They get a +3 bonus to str based skills/ability checks, and they can expend it for +10 damage that bypasses DR on 1 attack or a +20 on a single str check.))&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says "To facilitate cooperation, a moderator has been appointed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We expect that you will not necessarily happy with this choice, but no one woul dplease everyone,. so we ask that you respect this choice in matter where we cannot reach a decisions on our own.&nbsp; Avandra has been chosen."&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra looks like she wants to decline, but thinks better of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; she definately didn't know in advance.&nbsp; Avandra says "I will accept this responsibility reluctantly and attempt to be as fair and balanced as i can."&nbsp; <br /><br />Fiendgaze narrows his eyes "Is this choice not a conflict of interest betweent he representative of the free cities and the impartiality that is represented by such a position."&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says :Would you prefer Kord?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord's reaction. "Well, hopnestly, I'd be glad to bust some heads when you get out of lines, but I can't stick around."&nbsp; Zahar used straw man argument, like "Avandra or horrible."<br /><br />Erathis replies to fiendgaze:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Your concerns were considered, but we could think of no one better... do you have an alternative proposal?&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reluctant to ask, for its been decided..."&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiendgaze doesn't...&nbsp; but stares Avandra.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says "for those of you dissatisfied, we need only agree on our course of action and her role as moderator will be irrelevent."&nbsp; *chuckle*.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The floor is opened.&nbsp; <br /><br />We mention that we offer informtaion about the nexuses.&nbsp; Erathis asks if we have any info of production efforts...&nbsp; Vanquisher asks if it can be channeled into a weaponm...&nbsp;&nbsp; We aren't certain.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline says that the energy coukld be used as a weapon against withered undead...&nbsp;&nbsp; and Admatha glares...&nbsp;&nbsp; and says that several of her missing invulnerabilities mising could be irrelevent.. but most would consider that I'm human again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Darros asks if we could siphon it from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says that's not work risking because it might damage the nexus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Cashir says he's concerned with 3 things:&nbsp;&nbsp; our forces, how are going to deployu them, and what to do afterward...&nbsp;&nbsp; and of course what we're up against.<br /><br />Discussion from the nomads...&nbsp;&nbsp; they distrusst the other cultures use of nexuses...&nbsp; because two cities of delphia have fallen due to the experimentation they have cause.d&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a unique opportunity and they want to make sure its not wasted.&nbsp; That no one group should have control over it will be irrelevent.&nbsp;&nbsp; THe nomads say that experimentation shouldn't be done on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sidalfus asks well then what the hell do we do with it?&nbsp;&nbsp; The nomads say that there's a way to siphon off the nexyus energy to experiment upon, but experimenting on the nexus -itself-, that would be fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Erathis nods and agrees, asks for dissent...&nbsp;&nbsp; No dissent.&nbsp;&nbsp; Demrithor sits back and <br /><br />No experimenting on the nexus itself.&nbsp; Siphon off energy and experiment on that only.<br /><br />Sibil says "Oraculum, until it fell into demonic hands, was a delphina city.&nbsp;&nbsp; it is our desire that it remain so, and we are willing to make concessions as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of them that we freely do so, is that any from the underdark be able to come in and use it, as long as they're bound by our reasonable rules...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; violence is not to be done, theft is illegal...&nbsp;&nbsp; *lists*&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone who is willing to abide by such strictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; All are welcome to come and refresh, should they wish.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />One of the independents: Kendrin: "Do we really need to figure about the juridstiction of it?&nbsp;&nbsp; You lsot it... can't we just agree that it should be an independent nation?"&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says there's merit to that idea... considering it represent s the interests of everyone assembled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admatha stands and says many interests might be better served if several voices are present in oraculum.&nbsp;&nbsp; there is a key piece of information you forgot...&nbsp;&nbsp; The plenipotentiary has the key to the cities defenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plenipotentiary says that of course there will be concessions...&nbsp;&nbsp; How about we make cities nearby...&nbsp;&nbsp; or rather, we'd all be one city, each of whom is able to access the nexus as desired.<br /><br />Bloodletter is like divide the city!?&nbsp;&nbsp; gargh!<br /><br />Sibil says that other cities owuld be built in the same area.<br /><br />Bloodletter says that the people from the mixed cultures the empire has assimilated has caused chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil agrees, says that's why they could make another...<br /><br />Sibil aslo says the underdark people could of course provide the undergorund cave under the nexus with its defenses and such.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar is worried that a beaurcracy could prevent action/use of the nexus if not done well, but if not all factions aren't represented, there s a danger they go unheard.&nbsp; <br /><br />Artemis (Another plenipotentiars; of factum) "What of all the technology that we've invested in the city... at least we should harvest it.."&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil says that if the council agrees, Oraculum would remain a delphian city, but other nearby cities could be made by the other factions.<br /><br />Zahara proposes an addendum.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand the city of oraculum remaining Delphian.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe it would also be reasonable for hte nexus itself to lie within no ones territory. "&nbsp; Sibil says that for this to happen, they'd need to move oraculum...&nbsp;&nbsp; not that that's impossible...&nbsp; and if the technology could be made to move the place, that would be a fine idea, and she'd happily move it slightly away...&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar also suggests that the nexus itself be neutral gorund, even if its within a delphian city.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is to that end that Sibil offers free access.<br /><br />The air genasi nomad says that they've heard those words before, about free access, and is doubtful.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Sibil says that should they be able to rebuild or move the city so that the nexus is outside of the walls of the city, that would be alright.&nbsp; <br /><br />I get the impression that Sibil is tryiong to pull the most advantage out for her city because she wants the best for her city, and she's willing to make concessions because if she doesn't, then she'll not get her city back.<br /><br />She knows her initial suggestion was unreasonable, and expected to nmake concessions.<br /><br />Simone says if building a settlement is required to get a stake in this nexus, then what about all these free cities or nomads...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, any discussion&nbsp; about what to<br /><br />Sibil:&nbsp;&nbsp; To be hoinest, i'm not sure how much of a stake they would have.&nbsp;&nbsp; if they don't have the kind of security to make sure its not abused, I don't see why they'd be concerned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, i suspect each city could provide their own settlements and troops and help.<br /><br />Vanquisher:&nbsp;&nbsp; "My peopel have a bellief that you cannot own a piece of land that you are not at...&nbsp;&nbsp; if people wish to have a stake that aren't there, they won't have any stake there very soon."<br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp;&nbsp; "This may be superfluous, but whatever accord we rteach today, I think it reasonable, that all representing their factions should swear an oath to that effect...&nbsp;&nbsp; if trust is an issue, as is understandable, It seems a reasonable course, givent he gravity of what we deal with."&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask of what to oathbind to, and such...&nbsp;&nbsp; well, basically, we should do it here, and then we'll work out for a persistant solution later.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says "Then should we make a decision on this idea of oaths in general."&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says he's not sure of the immediacy of its relevance... and he's not sure who could bind deities by oath.&nbsp; She says that even without the avatars doing so, if everyone else did, that would go a long way to secure stability.&nbsp; <br /><br />A gnome speaks up quietly from delphia "Is this not somethign of a chicken or an egg problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; We could all agree to swear an oath, but that will color our decision making process.&nbsp;&nbsp; everyone will know they'll need to swear in oath."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We table the issue of the oath.&nbsp; <br /><br />The position of the nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil says they're willing ot rebuild oraculum (making it capable of tis own motion) so it can be removed fromt he nexus.&nbsp; Any groups that are represented may form their own settlements, all will recieve free access to the nexus, in exchange for a share of defense to the nexuses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any changes to the nexus itself would need to be approved by all the leaders unanimously.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nexus is territory owned by no one.&nbsp; Anyone may build a settlement in the surrounding area and recieve full considering for using the nexus in exchange for providing security for the nexus.<br /><br /><br />Zahar mentions that wanderers not represented by any faction&nbsp; should be allowed as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the independent cities are proposed as being lumped in with the others.&nbsp; The town leaders are sus[picious, like maybe she's trying to trap them...&nbsp;&nbsp; everyone being able to use the nexus...&nbsp;&nbsp; on the one hand, they have more power with it, but more.<br /><br />Avandra says what if someone wants to build a settlement but there's no room.&nbsp; Sibil says what do you mean by someone new.<br /><br />Ehlonna:&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, there are those deep in the wilds that aren't repersented here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil considers, says that this would come to a decision of the leaders...&nbsp;&nbsp; so since any new peoples wouldn't have helped retaking it, they deserve less notice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Less, yes, but nmot none.<br /><br />Sibil says that nayone would be able to come in and use the nexus, bnut its clear we all have the stake in this matter... and including outsiders here there should be discussions with leaders of each of the settlements.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone asks how much approval need be required in entry into the nexus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says it should be a unanimous decision by the leaders.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kord leaves... boring....&nbsp; <br /><br />Provision for barring pepole from the nexus for people who offend it or their owners...&nbsp;&nbsp; if its a member of a faction, they should be settled with by that faction, and if they're outside a faction we should all have equal effort invested in tracking them down.<br /><br />Someone suggests we postpone the constitution draft and the like.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admatha says she suggests just to make sure that the transgressions of one not be held against hte group.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sibil says there's no reason tribal hordes wouldn't be able to help for these nexuses...&nbsp; this is a momentous opportunity to make a lasting peace among all of us.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sense motive says she's interested in serving evberyones interestss as well as possible, but there's a decided undertone of a desire to maintain complete control of her city, which she's not giving up in anything she's proposing, but she doesn't want to alienate anyone else there.&nbsp; The idea that everything needs to be unanimous means that although she can't poush her own interests, but no one else can either because she can stonewall if needed.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis puts forth the proposal summary: "We will retrofit the city such that it can be moved...&nbsp; *Artemis nods and says it can be done, my lady*. This does represent another major investiture of delphian resources and I hope you all apreciate that.&nbsp;&nbsp; once the city has been moved next to the balanced nexus, this will serve as our interest in the region.&nbsp;&nbsp; The remainder of the territoryu will be divied up in a way ypoou all see fit, and in exchange you will provide security for your portion of the perimiter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any change to the nexus itself or the surrounding area must be unanimous, and we can discuss the initial conditions at a later time."&nbsp; <br /><br />Vashir's father asks a question: "It has been somewhat taken for granted the division of the land... but an amount of territory for each of us... and the amount isn't clear."&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil says that the underdark would doubtless get the caverns beneath the place...&nbsp; Vashjir's dad is pleased, but he looks around like he's expecting obnjection.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says that remember that the nexus isn't a point, but a column that exists above and below the surface, so the nexus below the surface would equally belong to no one.&nbsp; Balthazar s like of course, anyone would be welcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar says that any who need safe passage and the like are done...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />And should it be voted to do so, perhaps the delphians could use teleportation to allow communication between the upper and lower worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp; but this communication should not be difficult.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ironheart asks that they have the ability to exercise judgement to discern groups...&nbsp;&nbsp; I.E. allowing an army in just to refresh would be foolish.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil says good point, we'd just let them in a few at a time.&nbsp; Zahar says there'll be a lot of refugees.&nbsp;&nbsp; finding a way to let everyone refresh there would be difficult, so they should consider organizing that later.<br /><br />peacekeeper says its his hope that they'll no longer be at odds with teh citizenry of the empire once the battle is done, but we will state our claim of a small portion of terrirtory in case they do not accept us back (Empire says fuck you, peacekeeper, basically)&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra: "I must second this issue of quantity of territory; Each of those i represent has didferent areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil says that the territory given will depend on how many people they plan to have reside there...&nbsp;&nbsp; oraculum will have all the glory it once had, and are willing to provide such security.&nbsp;&nbsp; should fochlucan only have one structure with a few people in it, thye'd not hjave much, but they'd still have a stake in it.&nbsp; Fochlucan says says that that could be a problem because they have few troops.&nbsp; Sibil mentiosn that not all of the areas need to exactly touch the nexus.&nbsp;&nbsp; but all of these are logistic issues once we have determined who's interested in building such a settlement.&nbsp; For instance, should all of the fochlucan troops fall, it would be imprudent&nbsp; to give them a lot of territory.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give what they can hold, basically.&nbsp; Sibil says that should territory division not be such a simple thing, perhaps we could simply encircle the nexus like this room, and each could fill in and spiral around according to these needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Sophia:&nbsp;&nbsp; "perhaps we should establish those with the ultimate authority to make territory assignments at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp; if we each have a representative on a council we decide now.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we don't, there will be fighting over the boudnaries."&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil: "With the exceptions of hte divine among us, the representatives who sit at the temple now shoudl suffice.&nbsp;&nbsp; In place of erathis, sibil suggests herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Artemis is pissed, most of the other plenip[otentiaries don't.&nbsp; Sidalfus is tough to read, but we sense of entitlement from artemis, but not sidalfus... she's interested for some reason, wants to speak up, but she's not sure why.&nbsp;&nbsp; In general among the delphians, they aren't exactly satisfied.&nbsp; Erathis is mostly impassive.&nbsp; She senses their dischord.&nbsp; She doesn't want to support or object any one of her followers.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis:&nbsp; "I would of course, as stated, wish to step down after this is concluded, but only if the plenipotentiaries can fairly decide among themselves who will be replacing me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil, you've done a notable job, and what happened at oraculum is not your fault, but it would be best to come to a balanced decision."&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil seems to accept it, but is not happy about it..&nbsp; <br /><br />As is delphian tradition, perhaps theyu'll each share a partial vote...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibil says that would be acceptable.&nbsp; The others reluctantly nod too...&nbsp;&nbsp; because they understand its going to be hard to get anything hard there.&nbsp; Minerva asks about Selwyn.&nbsp; Erathis says "Should we recover him from wherever he is, I see no reason he would not be equal among you as well."&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone except minerva glowers a bit, she doesn't care much.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention the independents... Avandra says that its a bit unbalanced to give us all just one seat at the table... vanquisher is like it could be worse and you could have no space...&nbsp; Avandra turns to all of us.&nbsp; asks if we're all willing to be on a subcouncil...&nbsp;&nbsp; Tatenda is unrepresented, but taht's fine because no ones there.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the representatives looks kinda smarty... says "I would acquiesce to be on the council with these five cities, but any other ones."&nbsp;&nbsp; Stonehammer says they don't really need kas, but the order of the common shield woul dget a seat.&nbsp; They seem to think its acceptable.&nbsp; We offer our help with the perimeter, of course.&nbsp; So we have a seat on the council.&nbsp;&nbsp; More specifically, Biger will represent the order.&nbsp; Alagos kinda glares looking at us...&nbsp;&nbsp; he's getting... (Peril's edge is the independent city on the edge of wilds deep in the feywood.)<br /><br /><br /><br />((On the fourth floor of the skyline we found Ed.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's in a dormant state like when we rest, but he won't wake up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I let Admatha has his form&nbsp;&nbsp; She'll check him pretty frequently.&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp; But no Dariel.&nbsp; Note to self to talk to erathis about getting Ed active again.))<br /><br />Erathis says we've agreed on a number of issues.&nbsp; The nexus will be a neutral territory with a radius to be decided later.&nbsp;&nbsp; ANyone present here may build a settlement in the surrounding area as long as they provide security.&nbsp; We will all buold on the surface except the underdark who will build below.&nbsp; any change to the area of the nexus or the nexus itself needs to be unanimously decided on.,&nbsp; each of us at the table here will be a member of a council here, except the delphians and the independence&nbsp; (Ehlonna says the fey don't care, basically.), as described above.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar asks if councilors could be replaced.&nbsp; Many people have other duties as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; erathis says it seems reasonable that any of you be allowed to name a replacement... some quiet though, no one objects.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha says maybe domination could be a problem.&nbsp; But if everyone considers the point to not be that important, its fine...&nbsp; Darros asks a compromise:&nbsp;&nbsp; A unanimous veto of the person could do it.&nbsp; The vanquisher says that obviously the replacement would have to be from the same faction, to prevent nonsense.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sidalfus speaks up again:&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that we're agreed on these politcal matters, time to proceed to the tactics.<br /><br />Siomone asks for a small recess.&nbsp; Avandra asks for objections.&nbsp; There are none.&nbsp; we recess.&nbsp; during this, Sibil and Erathis go off and discuss in private really quick, that they are doing so is public knowledge.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />dardenos approaches me and says my contingent is primarily paladins, we coudl join up with Dardenos.&nbsp; He does ask if my paladins of bahamut know the truth of the draconic natures.&nbsp;&nbsp; I explain that yes they do.&nbsp; But that they won't necessarily believe he was telling the truth.&nbsp; <br /><br />When erathis comes back, Sidalfus is no longer with them.&nbsp; Zahar and Vashir talk.&nbsp; <br /><br />There has been an incident with one one of my number and I am compelled to mention this to all of you. *Says erathis*&nbsp;&nbsp; She's being honest, but she is not happy.&nbsp; She says Sidalfus has been discovered to be colluding with demogorgon in some manner.&nbsp; This was discovered thanks to a suspicioun by Simone.&nbsp; So she should be thanked that this was done before we discussed tactics... she escaped through some means which may be linked to an invisible ring she had.&nbsp; It is fortunate that what we have discussed thus far has been after any successful attempt, and as such will be of limited use, but he knows this city is coming for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm unsure if we should do further investigations, but I must apologize for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be wise for us to simply use oaths now to swear our trust to one another... so that he learns nothing more than he already has.&nbsp; She wants an oath of loyalty against demogorgon.<br /><br />Vanquisher stands and says he propose to tell no lies for this oath.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that anyone who refuses be rejected.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then propose that since we are swearing oaths and therte are gods then, we swear on them, and then we are each asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna says there may be philosophical differences with one of us, so swearing to any one of us should be reasonable.&nbsp; Avandra says that she gives her word that she's not working for demogorgon.&nbsp;&nbsp; erathis says of course she's been preparing for this for months...&nbsp;&nbsp; and that she was not involved...&nbsp;&nbsp; ditto Ehlonna.&nbsp; <br /><br />Many are like well, we need to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we swear the oaths...&nbsp;&nbsp; its done clockwise.&nbsp; among the table then the people in the galleries.&nbsp; The people at the table each swear to whoever makes the most political sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some swear to all three.&nbsp; Vanquisher swears on Ehlonna and obad-hai.&nbsp; Vanquisher is like 8 feet tall.&nbsp;&nbsp; he is a creature is a large creature with red skin.&nbsp; Nobody gets ejected from this process.&nbsp; I swear to these three and Garl Glittergold.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone is really iffy about swearing the oath because she doesn't really want to.&nbsp; she and yin and yang swear to tell no lies while in this chamber rather than to always tell the truth, like everyone else does.&nbsp; Everyone else swears the oath and says truthfully they aren't serving demogorgon.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Erathis drew the conclusion of the invisible ring under the glove herself.)&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask erathis what she knows about these rings.&nbsp; she says it was her first experience with such a thing... it was an invisble plain silver ring on her hand.&nbsp; it was also concealed beneath her glove.&nbsp; Simone claimed that She had recieved this ring form demogorgon.&nbsp; As such, if anyone has any info about these rings...&nbsp;&nbsp; Admatha stands up and says Simone has it.&nbsp; Simone declares she doesn't<br /><br />(Sahret, Arwel.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask what ring Simone does bear.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says we need to reconcile this disagreement now...&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask what is going on here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar asks what the rings are.&nbsp; Simone says they have no relevance.<br /><br />Erathis says that simone does admit to wearing an invisible silver band.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."&nbsp; says simone.<br /><br />Erathis says that it would be best to just explain yourself here, rather than tryign to hide behind half truths.&nbsp;&nbsp; We owe you a debt for exposing the other, and I don't doubt you, but it would be contentious if we allowed you to stay with no consensus.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone says that any explanation will A: potentially cost her great harm, B:L steer the proceedings off course, and C: be irrelevent here, anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this isn't good enough, I('ll take my leave.<br /><br />We ask if Ehlonna knows.&nbsp; She says that she has seen one such ring before...&nbsp; On (kith).&nbsp; but that is all she knows.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sophia says that the fochlucan lyrists all have them... it allows you to see others of the rings and allows instant communication among one another.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are given only to members of our use circle... my son has one, as does Arwel.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they are currently not able to be contacted by these means.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar asks if Simone's <br /><br />erathis says it became relevent when another such ring was a central issue wiht treason.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone says that's why they all swore the oath.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vanquisher says there are now two such rings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanquisher asks that Sophia not use the ring to contact Demogorgon.&nbsp; She'd be willing to remove the ring.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone says her only contact with demogorgon was with some of us here, searching for a wand that he possessed.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask if After Demogorgon's defeat anyone plans to take the palce back for their own forces.&nbsp; <br /><br />For what its worth in Simones defense, I feel her oath binding her spirit.&nbsp; (Says ehlonna).&nbsp; <br /><br />So we go on.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have this week out of game to discuss tactics.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or troop recommendations.&nbsp; <br /><br />Dave is going for the balance that Joel got.&nbsp; so he'll take some heaven fist maneuvers to switch stuff out.&nbsp; <br /><br />We can lead units...&nbsp; and we have (880000 total gold to get gear for this.)&nbsp; We have a month in game.&nbsp; Anything in the pathfinder book with a GP value we can get... if its questionable ask.&nbsp; There's a definate maybe on tomes.&nbsp; Maybe something like a legacy weapon sort of thing or something.&nbsp; Other in game sources...&nbsp; both of the two IO dragons have access to their hordes...&nbsp;&nbsp; They're giving it on long term loan.&nbsp; Crazy technomagic versions of thing, Delphia will do that.&nbsp; We can spend merit points on some gear.&nbsp; There's a lot of nice shit.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Tentatively the tomes are ok... just pay for them.)&nbsp; <br /><br />After the proceedings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone will answer any questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Puts the ring down on the table, silences...&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone explains:&nbsp;&nbsp; Its a membership ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; there's an organization Simone knows liuttle about.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was recruited by the magistrate of tateclenya several years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Besides Kith who else has had one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone says she knows that the one that Sidulfus had was unrelated.&nbsp; A similar concept but not.<br /><br />Why was she recruited.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was introduced by the magistrate to do some errands.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was told to find Sigil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its image was in a prophecy.&nbsp;&nbsp; As far as Simone can say its a well known prophecy.&nbsp; Since then he's had no contact witht htem.&nbsp; the organization does not have a name 'the guild'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask who the magistrate at the time was.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Cameron (Jason's character.)&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone says that when she presented the ring to Mowrlyn, Mowrlyn (black priestess) was shaken, which worries Simone.&nbsp; Simone was afraid of taking it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Isaline suspects they're involved with teh shapeshifters...&nbsp; Because she can think of 3-4 of them.&nbsp; Kith is presumably in a similar situation.&nbsp; Cameron/Sasha had one of course...&nbsp;&nbsp; Cilius vartara is a shapeshifter as well, Calenon said there was a suspicious activity.&nbsp; Vanya says they haven't seen Cilius for some time.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was also a shapeshifter involved in dragontamers murder who probably had one as well, and there was also a shapeshifter involved in the assasination attempts in the skyline a bit ago. And one of Jonas's mens also had one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha looks at peacekeeper, says that the organization is responsible for his death, he asks for explanation.&nbsp; Kith or an eidolon of him is directly responsible for peacekeepers death.&nbsp; the former magistrate also acquirted the sword that killed him.&nbsp; These people all have no true.. form, basically.&nbsp;&nbsp; Peacekeeper nods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaks up and says that the weapon that was used to take his life was extraordinarily dangerous.&nbsp; He looks around and specifically looks at the gods and says That through peacekeeper, the weapon was able to harm Io directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; it cannot be allowed to be wielded by anyone reallyk, and it should be destroyed.&nbsp; kas is a bit pride and her hatred for the gods comes through a bit.&nbsp; (The swords position in the prophjecy was used to impale a dryad and she became a withered and she represented the world...&nbsp;&nbsp; the world used it aghainst peacekeeper and turned him into a withered.<br /><br />Ehlonna asks about the sword.&nbsp; Says that maybne this secret guild came after her.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they wouldn't have attempted to slay her without the sword or something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar asks a moment to speak witbh us...&nbsp; everyone acqueisces.<br /><br />Kiths Ring is like his ring.&nbsp;&nbsp; The delphians all know about Sigil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Baalzebul knows, the gods know, Most of the others don't know...&nbsp;&nbsp; dragontamer said that the empire shouldn't learn about sigil, remember...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no one in general knows what's going on... the nomads kinda.&nbsp;&nbsp; Io faction knows now.<br /><br />It's PC time.&nbsp; We go and stand in a corner.&nbsp; Zahar says he's relucatnt to speak about it, but Kith does bear a copy of the weapon sized to him.&nbsp; He doesn't know why or how, but he porbably bears it with reason.&nbsp; Someone feels he should have it for.&nbsp; Zahar believes that if Kith bears it he believes he has a good reason.&nbsp; there is something he is seeking.&nbsp; The assassin of Ehlonna had a similar weapon and was looking as Kith but wasn't him.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The assassin that came to attack... to slay ehlonna bore the same sword... so we know that at least to copies of the sword exist.&nbsp; The assassin teleported away in a way that was completely unknown without invoking a spell.&nbsp; He idd it the same way Sidalfus did; Simone mentipons this.&nbsp; Kith probably wants to stab Vasnce.&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the orc merchant who had the sword.&nbsp; He's probably the assassin.&nbsp; He's a shapeshifter with the ring and he might have a sword, but IC we don't really know that for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Now we know what we face...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Simone feels that the greater danger was not to reveal this.&nbsp; We tell simone that if she wants ot destroy the ring, we'll protect her.&nbsp;&nbsp; they might not know of her betrayal.&nbsp; We have hjuge research facilities&nbsp; <br /><br />I have a plot point!&nbsp;&nbsp; This cult we've found out is a god killing cult.&nbsp; Kas's loyalty is in question...&nbsp; since she made a godslaying weapon and hate it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas is definately eavesdropping.&nbsp; She's thoughtful upon hearing all this.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone walks back to the table.&nbsp; Asks if there are any further questions.&nbsp; We worked out a lot of this stuff in public.<br /><br />Baalzebul will mention that if demogorgons forces also possess these rings, more may be going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says is it a coincidence?&nbsp; <br /><br />The rings of Sophia have been handed down through her family for generations, she doesn't know where they originally came from.&nbsp; She says its possible they all have a common origin.&nbsp;&nbsp; their group may need to reexamine the safety of using these rings.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says there is time to research the properties of the rings, as it is relevent to me and my avatars...&nbsp; Peacekeeper says he's also interested, matter-of factly.&nbsp; We should see if the fochlucan rings and the other rings are connected.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha confronts Kas having made the sword.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says... 'forged is a very strong word... it wasn't necessarily...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well, it was forged to kill vecna in particular.It was made for Kas to stab Vecna, and from there...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask if others have made more, or if its just the flow.&nbsp; Someone may have duplicated the tech, but she only made the one.<br /><br />We ask how easy it would be made to make others...&nbsp;&nbsp; she says it would be possible, but to her knowledge, nothign of that sort has been created yet...&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods are now giving her much more scrutinizing looks.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Erathis knew a bit of the sort, and now knows about it.)<br /><br />Erathis says it would explain a number of suspicious activities at arx over the past year... when they had the sword in their possession, they decided to move it via lineship.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vartara claimed they had reached the endpoint of their research and it needed to be moved to imptempestivous.&nbsp; vartara probably did the attack.&nbsp; <br /><br />The vanquisher is also very interested to know more about this group...&nbsp; he looks fairly enraged at the idea he was just a tool.&nbsp; <br /><br />Jonas, by being in that place had great powers, specifically over geomantic effects that should have been impossible, but he wasn't even a geomancer, and Cilius WAS...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if an actual geomancer had gotten a hold of thjat kind of power, it could challenge the gods...&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell, even just what he was doing might have been on par with gods.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says it might be worthwhile to see if it owuld be possible to unorder cities... it is a power none of us should possess.&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says the flow has sprouted before...&nbsp; perhaps it can be made to go there again.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The god of geomancy is Tharis dune?&nbsp; <br /><br />(Also Jonas rewrote history to remove Arwel.<br /><br />Baalzebul says that there's truth to Zahar...&nbsp;&nbsp; the previous attempt to remove the world from the flow...&nbsp;&nbsp; involved coordination from our gods.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the ordering is a nother similar plot, where owuld he be getting his power from, or perhaps he does himself, knowing the threads he has woven are unraveling.&nbsp; Baalzebul says it might be prudent to do whatever is possible to find out what exactly asmodeus is doing now that the gods of the empire are coming closer to being free, we may have more opportunity to learn from them what his plan is.&nbsp; <br /><br />Note to self to&nbsp; mention that maybe this cult is connected with the chained god.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Zahar asks Fiendgaze:&nbsp;&nbsp; "i am to understand that the majority of the warlocks of the red are&nbsp; or may not be, but you yourself ARE a servitor of asmodeus.&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp; He will make a wry smile.&nbsp; "Why do you seek to aid what will almsot certainly be your opponents."&nbsp;&nbsp; He says 'perhaps you misunderstand our situation. Let me ask you this... what purpose does it serve if we allow ourselves to wither and die.'&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can see none."&nbsp;&nbsp; 'then perhaps you have your answer.'&nbsp; "but surely you realize that no one here will allow asmodeus or his forces to control this nexus."&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline asks Fiendgaze what his people were before the curse.&nbsp; peacekeeper looks slightly remorseful.&nbsp; I mention that they were once humans.<br /><br />Reactions to this:&nbsp; We can all tell that peacekeeper didn't necessarily want it to be known but he did know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fiendgaze largely conflicted, :&nbsp;&nbsp; he wants us dead, but also that we mentioned that tieflings were all humans and that's interesting.&nbsp; The gods reaction; they all get a hesitant look.&nbsp;&nbsp; and look at eachother.&nbsp; They don't disagree, but its an uncomfortable topic... a wariness, like this conversation could go to places we don't want it to in front of everyone.&nbsp; (Like... where do humans come from.)<br /><br />Baalzebul says. "At any rate, I think it may be impolite for us to discuss asmodeus' part here... but we can all agree that he and Demogorgon are working at cross purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; So let's deal with Demogorgon first.&nbsp; <br /><br />We look around, we adjourn.&nbsp; <br /><br />We have some things to ask the gods.&nbsp; <br /><br />We mention that Simone can see into people's past.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar wonders... there are bits and pieces of his past which are useful to him which are inaccessible, and is wondering what humanity was, once.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar says "If I am human, and I have been Deva, so far as I know, there has never been a rakshasa becoming deva....&nbsp;&nbsp; which means I was human when there were still humans... that could be of some value to us.&nbsp; From what Simone saw earlier, when he was a deva, he had multiple pasts.&nbsp; Simone sees multiple pasts of him even after he's become human.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not like Isaline.&nbsp; If he's correct and he was human long ago, she can't see that easily... way too far back.&nbsp; Perhaps later they'll do a more in depth study.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone is going to be on edge for a while.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention that the cult may be associated with the chained god.&nbsp; Ehlonna says That that isn't the case, hopefully.<br /><br />Avandra says that his power is beyond comprehension.&nbsp; We cannot reveal information about him to anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp; it would be the end of everything if he were to gain a following.<br /><br />Erathis asks Zahar where he saw knowledge of the chained god.&nbsp; We mention Goldsmith.&nbsp;&nbsp; and bits and pieces of peoples visions here and there... the quakes are more intense...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other gods are not with us now for a reason; they have gone to attend to these matters.<br /><br />Zahar is about to say something but instead says that perhaps speaking of it would ruin its chances of success... then he asks anyway...&nbsp;&nbsp; "hhave they successfully ejected the pretender from the temple. "&nbsp; 'Who had our visage?' "Yes."&nbsp; 'I think that if it were so easy, it would have been done a long time ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are things that are very difficult to undo.&nbsp;&nbsp; And in particular wielding magic over much can have unfortunate consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that to remove that influence over the place could be mroe of a risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; ' But she's aware that they're all aware that Asmodeus has power there.&nbsp; <br /><br />The soul facotry is mentioned.&nbsp;&nbsp; And sayus that she doesn't wish to discount what that means... wants something to be understood; the devils are singular beings.&nbsp; evben the mightiest army cannot, if dispersed through the flow, do much.&nbsp; it is for this reason that devils seek mortal servants.&nbsp; What you speak of simply makes such a place impregnable.&nbsp; <br /><br />(When we were talking about the gods visaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hear in my mind from Wrin "The temple bears a taint.&nbsp;&nbsp; even the gods can see only what he wishes. Very powerful magic, done very long ago.&nbsp; extraction would be inconvenient, perhaps impossible.")&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Were the gods right... when they destroyed us?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Ehlonna looks very uncomfortable... 'I believe that such a thing would not happen if it were not truly necessary, but I do not knwo the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know everything that happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not know that the gods would have done such a thing if they hadn't believed it absolutely necessary.&nbsp; "&nbsp;&nbsp; She has very heavy conviction...&nbsp;&nbsp; Its like this is sawing off your own arm in order to survive... its unapalatable and you may regret it forever, but you had to do it.&nbsp; And she only has inherited guilt.<br /><br />Avandra says "From everything I know, it all comes down to him [Theris dune]."&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar asks if it's true... if asmodeus was once human.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Maybe he wants to wake up big daddy...&nbsp;&nbsp; and or maybe he achieved what the other humans didn't manage... he became a god.&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps he managed it by abandoning tharis dune.) Ehlonna says "Yes, Asmodeus was once human.&nbsp;&nbsp; Asmodeus is an excellent example of what would have happened if things had not been done the way they had.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of the gods who are new became so extraordinaryu that this was logical...&nbsp;&nbsp; my parents created me.&nbsp;&nbsp; others have been created... others were once human."&nbsp; Avandra maybe such of one.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ehlonna says that some humans were chosen for godhood like Kord was (Before the purge, obviously).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some stole it, like Asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; even as Theris Dune was being imprisoned, he meddled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar mentions perhaps he gained it by turning upon his people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Possibly with the idea of turning on all of you.&nbsp; <br /><br />In the short term, everyone wants demogorgon to lose the nexus.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask if the balanced nexus is dangerous in conterxt of [him].&nbsp; <br />They say "You know nothing."<br /><br />Ehlonna:&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's something you need to understand... we spoke wearlier of sigil, and this curse..&nbsp;&nbsp; that was not always the case...&nbsp;&nbsp; demogorgon is responsible for sigil's destruction in some past histories... his power is unbelieveable... and this new nexus form in his hands is a catastrophe of unmprecedented proportions."<br /><br />This is why their involve,ment is permitted... the majority of the gods are aligned with this, and it should be clear why.<br /><br />Zahar brings back up the fact that asmodeus has already broken the rules.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha asks that perhaps the chained god would be in favor of us getting the nexus back.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha says that he shows favor for them attempting to wrest control from demogorgon.&nbsp; <br /><br />Isaline mentions the raven queen was pulling the strings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps through his power.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask what the raven queen's conenction to Tharis dune was.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the gods says that for whatever reason she saw fit to tap into his energy to move mortals around like pawns..<br /><br />Simone asks well, why us?&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that from the talks with Ioun, that quesiton is frequently asked, adn the answer is often circular.&nbsp; We are prophesied because we are chosen and we are chosne because we are prophesied.&nbsp; Ehlonna says consider the cataclysmm and the prophecies around it and what is happening now and why...&nbsp;&nbsp; there are so many people who attempted to prevent it, liekt he delphians, and look where we are now...&nbsp; there is no law that prphecy cannot fulfill itself.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask what produces prophecy... Avandra says this "Consider that perhaps [he] is the source...&nbsp;&nbsp; which means that these prophecies are coming from him... a terrifying thought."&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar:&nbsp;&nbsp; "If the agents of the empire are seeking a way to liberate those of the underdark from their reliance on dark nexuses and they themselves are seeking a way to perpetuate tehmselves upont his nexus energy... why are they still protected...&nbsp;&nbsp; why does Levistus still channel moradins power to keep us alive... why do they not simply let us wither... or will they do this as soon as we take oraculum... are they still capable of manipulating the empire... of us?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Erathis says It is likely they are.<br /><br />Admatha:&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider; to whom do most of the average sitizens of the empire pray? "&nbsp;&nbsp; well, bahamut and moradin... And moradin is actually kinda Levistus, and Bahamut is still half held by Asmodeus.&nbsp; It cannomt be wihtout some value...<br /><br />Ehlonna says "And even so, do you think io would allow his children to die?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Zahar asks of the dwarves, deva, rakshasa...&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra says "What of Levistus?&nbsp;&nbsp; is there not discord among hte lords of hell."&nbsp;&nbsp; Levistus says he really wants to rebel but is so terrified of the consequences he doesn't want to make a move unless he's rock solid.&nbsp; <br /><br /></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I want to feel proud for what we
accomplished today, but I don't know that I deserve much credit. 
When we created the balanced nexus, I was involved.  My geomancy
skills and my ability to enjoy inverted nexuses came in useful,
though my lack of actual skill or experience with handling a nexus
limited my usefulness.  But my point is, why I was involved in the
process, it was not mine.  I didn't even know this was possible, let
alone plan any of it.  I just aided with the execution.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This gathering was supposed to be
different.  I was not asked by anyone to gather those that are here. 
It was not my idea alone, and it's need was obvious, but it was my
quest.  I was not alone, but I felt ownership over this process.  I
spoke to most of the representatives of the factions that are in
attendance.  I used my connections to gain many audiences, and with
them, many pledges of support.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I had accomplished much to be proud of.
 Then Ioun goes and calls for this gathering.  At least I was
invited.  But now I don't know how useful my actions were, now that
the gods have stepped in and taken over.  Neither I, nor any of my
companions were important enough to be recognized in any official
capacity.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The meeting chamber was broken up into
different areas for each of the factions.  Ioun was apparently
responsible for determining who was a faction.   The Fochlucan
Lyricists were recognized, even though the only representative was
Sophia.  At the same time, Ed, Admatha, and Biger's organization was
not recognized.  As I said before, it would have been nice if someone
who had worked so hard to put this together had been acknowledged,
even if it wasn't me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">At least we were free to choose where
to sit.  For most, there wasn't much choice, but I had much to
consider.  I could have joined the Fey, as some of their blood runs
through my veins, and I can feel it's influence on me.  Speaking of
blood, I could have also joined the tribes, or Delphia, as they have
each welcomed me as family.  The empire is where I'm from, even if I
don't feel like it's home.  I had also established myself with the
Underdark, and would have loved to hear their whispers.  Ultimately,
my strength derives by my ability to belong anywhere, so I sat down
in front of the “Independent” section.    Though I still think I
should have had a seat at the table.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There was quite a gathering here.  I
was happy to see the much varied factions represented in the same
room.  In a nod to formality, every attendee was introduced by name
and title.  My title was “A Free Spirit”.  I wouldn't have it any
other way.  Sure it's not as impressive sounding as most of the other
titles, but I am here on my own.  I don't belong to any faction, I'm
not anyone's leader, and I like said, I wouldn't have it any other
way.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The downside to this, of course, is
that I don't really have an official voice.  Not in this conference,
nor in the council that will rule the settlements around the Nexus. 
The independent cities have their own council to manage their seat. 
I don't even remember if I get a voice on that council or not.  I
don't think I do.  It makes sense, since I don't represent a city, or
really anything.  I did speak up on their behalf a few times, but
they didn't seem that interested in pursuing any of the issues.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">That's not to say that I won't have any
influence.  I managed to bring most of the attendees to this table,
or at least I still want to believe I did.  I should be able to gain
the ear of any here.  Councils and government don't really interest
me that much.  I'm pretty sure I would get bored quickly if I had
actual responsibilities.  I guess I don't want responsibilities, or
positions, or official capacity so much as I want a little
recognition, and I want to be able to make sure that my efforts on
behalf of this nexus achieve my goals.  I'm not used to having a
cause to care about, and I just want keep it on track.  I can't just
hand it over, wipe my hands, and go to wherever the winds take me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">While all this organizational talk was
very interesting, the people audience was much more so.  Not for
anything they were saying or doing, but stories in this room were
overwhelming.  With so much here, I had a hard time focusing on any
specific individual.  That is, until I gazed upon Sidolphus.  In her
past I saw Demogorgon quite prominently.  It would have caught my
interest anyways, but after seeing him in my scry last week, I'm sure
that it was him.  I couldn't say anything in the middle of
conference, so I had to wait.  Besides, such issues are better dealt
with in private, than in front of the entire conference.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After an eternity, the discussions
about policy and government were concluding.  Sidolphus herself stood
up and requested that we move on to talking about military tactics. 
I couldn't let this happen, and she had provided me the perfect
opportunity.  I stood up and requested a recess for continuing.  I'm
sure the gods don't care, but I was not meant to sit in one seat for
hours on end.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The recess was granted, and I tried to
make my way to Erathis, but she was surrounded.  Not knowing where
else to turn, I went to Sibyl.  I apologized for the position I put
her in before but then got right to the point.  I told her of my
suspicion and of Erathis's popularity.  Sybil took charge and loudly
announced that she needed Erathis for a very important matter.  A
little less discrete that I prefer, but it worked.  At least if
someone has to draw attention to themselves, it shouldn't be me.  We
grabbed Sidolphus as well.  She does have a right to defend herself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I explained what I saw, and
predictably, Sidolphus denied everything.  I tried to get her to step
out, but she didn't like the idea of needing to step aside based only
on accusation.  Erathis talked to her as well, and I got a better
look.  I saw Demogorgon tossing her a plain silver band.  Of course
Sidolphus was wearing gloves.  She protested, but complied after
Erathis insisted.  The ring was invisible, but with my enhanced
vision, I could see it.  Sidolphus acted as if it weren't there, but
after activating a mechanical monocle, Erathis could see it as well. 
Sidolphus then somehow teleported away.  All I could tell is that she
was headed in the direction of Oraculum.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We decided that we would bring this to
the groups attention.  I didn't see any other traitors, but some
things have been hidden from me before, I couldn't see everyone
really well, and this cause is too important to worry about a little
pride.  Once we reconvened Erathis announced Sidolphus's actions. 
This caused quite a stir.  It was decided that everyone take an oath
to tell the truth, and to swear that they have no alliance with
Demogorgon.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">What to do, what to do?  I've never
sworn an oath before.  Last time someone tried, I simply walked away.
 I could walk away again, but I really want to be here.  I really
want this to succeed, and I really, really don't want to be bound to
tell the truth, especially not in front of this room.  In the end, I
followed the fey and swore not to lie.  I didn't want to draw
additional suspicion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">With not a moment wasted, Admatha stood
and accused me of having a ring like Sildophus.  I quickly stood and
insisted that I did not.  The questions then quickly came from her,
Biger, and Za'har.  I could only insist that my ring was irrelevant
to the proceedings.  Now, I think the rings may be more similar than
I initially thought, but at the time, I had little reason to
associate them.  I did not receive my ring from Demogorgon.  Also,
the Lyracists also use hidden rings to communicate.  It seems like an
obvious solution, and it's not unlikely that since at least two
groups use this method, that there aren't others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But they kept questioning me.  If they
would not believe me that my ring was irrelevant under oath, I don't
know that they would believe anything else that I said.  The validity
of my oath was even confirmed.  I had to say that I had my secrets,
just as everyone else in the room surely did.  I wanted to get back
on track, not focus secrets, mine or otherwise.  The Vanquisher, of
all people, stood up to end this nonsense.  The issue was dropped,
and discussions moved on to military matters.  I placed a silencing
effect on the ring in case they are connected and it's spying on us. 
I don't know what it can do, and I don't want to take chances.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And I thought that the governmental
discussions were boring.  I could pledge all the forces under my
control, but as they are comprised of me, myself, and I, and I am not
a warrior, I just tried to stay awake.  I feel like I made more than
my fair contribution by ferreting out Sildolphus.  That should be
worth at least as much as legion of warriors.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I wish Kith were here.  I would have
liked to discuss with him what to do.  This ring is becoming more and
more of a burden, and hasn't provided any benefits lately.  Not only
have I not been asked to do anything interesting lately, I haven't
been contacted at all.  I managed to get the magistrate into Sigil,
but even for that, I received nothing.  No reward, no thanks, not
even any acknowledgment.  In the mean time, these rings are drawing
more an more unwanted attention.  Kith hasn't said much, but he seems
wary.  It was his idea to offer them up to the ritual to create the
balanced nexus.  I wasn't sure, but I went along with it.  Not only
would that have rid us of the rings, it also exposed that we had
them.  Of course some of my companions saw my ring once they found
one on someone connected to the ordering.  And Cameron himself
exposed his and Kith's ring to the group.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I don't know what's going on with the
Guild.  I am very wary of exposing them, as I don't know who they
really are, or what they really want.  Sure, I know a few of them,
but I don't know how deep the rabbit hole goes.  They don't have
anything specific on me, but they know who I am, and they've proven
themselves to be quite resourceful and ruthless.  This is enough for
me to want to keep my mouth shut.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I wish I could talk to Kith, as
anything I say will also reflect on him.  But he's not here, and it's
up to me.  I can live with this weight on my finger, or I can try to
free myself from it.  When I look at it that way, I really have no
choice.  With this many in attendance, it's guaranteed that they will
find out about my actions.  If they have any agents in the city, any
attempt on me would expose them.  They shouldn't be able to send
anyone else into the city until this attack is resolved, so I should
be safe until then.  Kas, the forger of the sword that can slay gods,
is here, loyalties unknown.  And I have no way to know what else will
get out, or when.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">On the other hand, this is power and
interested group.  If there's anywhere I could be kept safe, it's
here.  Here goes nothing!  I stood up, walked to the table, took off
the ring and placed it on the table.  I announced to everyone that
the ring marked me as a member of the guild.  I told them what little
I knew, and answered any questions I could.  I even mentioned the
quest for Sigil.  I don't know if that was wise, but for those who
don't know, there should be enough meat to distract them.  Many
others had little pieces of information, and we discussed them for
quite some time.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I think I was vindicated for waiting to
bring this up, as the military matters were more important.  I hope
that this goes a long way to clearing any doubt about my intentions. 
I'm sure a few will still doubt me, even after I help create the
nexus, helped gather most of those here, rooted out a traitor, and
put my life on the line to expose the guild while under an oath, but
there's no reasoning with some people.</p>
