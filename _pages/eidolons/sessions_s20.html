      <p>I don’t like feeling trapped. I know this is where I’m supposed to be. And there are lots of interesting people here. And we are working to learn more about these rings. And there haven’t been any attempts on my life. But there is just something confining about being not being able to leave. <br /><br />It’s not even that I can’t leave, it’s that I can’t return. That’s even worse, because if I couldn’t leave, that would be the end of it. But now, every day, every moment, I need to choose to stay here. There’s a whole world going on out there that I’m missing out on. And I’m not even that useful around here. Sure, they poke and prod at my ring, but I don’t really need to be here for that. And I’m keeping an eye out for ties to Demogorgon, but I haven’t found, nor do I really expect to find any.<br /><br />But I do want to see this through to the end, so here I stay, day after day.<br /><br />At least we did learn a few interesting things about the rings. There seem to be several different but related sets of rings. The Fochlucan lyricists have rings that they use for communication, but they do little else. Guild rings can be used to send and receive messages, as well as teleport to another ring. They also have the ability to listen in on communication between other ring bearers, including the lyricists’ rings! There may still be other powers, but they are limited to shapeshifters or to gods. I may be able to trick it, but any attempts could be noticed, so I haven’t yet dared.<br /><br />Beyond that, it was a quiet month. I think most factions must have kept to themsevles. Amazingly, no real fighting broke out between them. I don’t know if it was the gods, wisdom, or pure isolation that kept the peace, but it was probably a little of each.<br /><br />Non too soon the day of the battle arrived. My initial plan was to stay back in the city and use a combination of scrying, messaging, and divination to aid our side. But once I saw all the many troops arranged and ready for battle, I just couldn’t resist. I’ve never gotten to fight in anything on this scale before. I was going to fight with a unit of Delphian geomancers. Figure I may learn a trick or two, or teach a trick or two. Either way, that’s where I felt I would fit best. <br /><br />Once Kord rushed forward to establish the front line, I just couldn’t resist. I needed to be in the thick of things, not back with a bunch of other geomancers. I enhanced my movement and rushed to join him. Biger also rushed up and covered my flank. Joseph and others joined on the other side. Kord cut down demon after demon, unit after unit. His revelry was palpable, and a little contagious. <br /><br />I didn’t intend to stay long, but, to my surprise, I was actually not terrible. I managed to take out a few units, and not get too badly hurt. Using a mixture of illusions, invisibility, short teleports, and a few other tricks, they had no idea where I was, or where I would be. After a while they just started swinging wildly. While a few lucky swings managed to give me a scratch or two, overall, they didn’t know what hit them.<br /><br />After fighting for a while, a few major players showed up on each side. The fey appeared with a few ekinoch and platapod units arrived. A few gods showed up in support of Demogorgon’s defense as well. Biger turned one of his cranks which resulted in a huge blast, and the formation of a nexus on the battlefield!<br /><br />The fight continues...</p>

      <p>This battle stands to be one of the biggest confrontations of this planes generation. &nbsp;All for the balanced Nexus. &nbsp;On our side are the combined forces of this plane against Demagorgan's forces. &nbsp;The balanced nexus is also giving us access to abilities we normally would not have. &nbsp;We are but minutes into this battle and I have but a moment to cronicle my thoughts to paper. &nbsp;The demons are terrifying, but what we do is&nbsp;necessary. &nbsp;As of yet we do not see the stronger demons, but we have been sweeping the weaker demon hordes despite their ability to greater teleport. &nbsp;Anne is anxious, but she has been holding her own as well. &nbsp;Seeing the dragons sweep the field has been...impressive to say the least. &nbsp;To think we faced those beasts ourselves is unthinkable. &nbsp;Yet the monsters we fight are just as frightening.<br /><br />For some reason, here I am able to wither at range, and this ability has come in handy. &nbsp;In fact I think I can attempt my fusion power to create an undead noone has seen before. &nbsp;A skeletal demon golem of sorts. &nbsp;But it will take more demons then I have ever tried before, hopefully it will be successful.</p><p>-Entry ends there-&nbsp;</p>
