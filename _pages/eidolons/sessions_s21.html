      <p><br />Simone's Narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after the battle, the guild tried to attack Simone.&nbsp; Simone fled to the Echidnox, because they're buddy buddy with her.&nbsp; Because anyone else could be compromised.&nbsp; She travelled back to the wilds with them.&nbsp; Since their village is like the safest thing ever.&nbsp; She's suddenly really suspicious.&nbsp; She's trying to make her guild ring out of phase with the other rings...&nbsp; Ultimately, to be seperate from the guild...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not get rid of it?&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe she can tap into it and hear what they're saying.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hope is to turn the ring against them.&nbsp; Main goal is to make it out of phase so the wearer of this ring functions differently.&nbsp; Simone also makes her last altered identity as a Nymph.&nbsp; Then Simone is looking for Kith...&nbsp;&nbsp; she eventually leaves the village.&nbsp; She tries to track down Kith...&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes the answer comes back hazy, but he's generally in oraculum, but he's stepping in and out of her continuum of the flow, so interfacing with him will be rouggh... step one would be to get back to oraculum.&nbsp; She's trying to take steps to meet him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Learns abotu the platipods.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're one of the first nomadic tribes.&nbsp;&nbsp; They still remember whent he nomads decided to be the nomads, and its all about that temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; The echidnox stayed nearby to regain the temple and protect it.&nbsp; Part of the whole idea of what the vanquisher was tryign to do was try and take it back, and he failed,. so the nomads were like screw this...&nbsp; the echidnox were like we'll wait for the moment.&nbsp; Those two tribes don't get along very well.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were some serious concessions made to make them work together after that fight.&nbsp; Also, we hear that the rulers of the fey court, her parents, are busy with something.&nbsp; Ehlonna wants&nbsp; Simone as one of her representatives to return to oraculum.&nbsp; just there to make sure the politics don't take away their ability to use the nexus.&nbsp; They were pledged 1/12th of the interest in that place and they want to retain it.&nbsp; Simone uses the alternate personage instead.&nbsp; Some Echidnox are there too, to refresh, because it won't drain the whole nexus.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The plotlines will go by days.&nbsp; (Friday or Saturday).&nbsp; <br /><br />I seek out the other nexus that was made when the crank was turned the first time.&nbsp; Hobgoblins have taken residence there and fiercely protect it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Biger negotiates with them a modest price in exhange for the ability to build a GG shrine there.&nbsp; I spend the rest of the time regrouping with the order of the Common shield and helping with the research.&nbsp;&nbsp; The paladins who mingled with the champions of bahamut are the majority of our survivors.&nbsp; Also, i write a grand song about events so far.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're working with Ed...&nbsp;&nbsp; and we've reactivated the map from him.&nbsp; Some Delphians here don't want him back on line now that they've got the map...&nbsp;&nbsp; Admatha's working on trying to get hgim back up, and pushing for warforged rights.&nbsp; <br /><br />We each get a sending from Kas to meet her in an outdoor plaza in oraculum around noon.&nbsp; <br /><br />We All go (admatha, Biger, and Simone.)<br /><br />Kas is waiting at a cafe speaking with a small figure (A gnome female who looks normal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually a formless entity... damn dopplegangers).&nbsp; Kas beeckons and we approach warily.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas Introduces Glee, the 'gnome', who looks at us warily.&nbsp; Glee says these people don't represent our ionterest.<br /><br />We notice a bit of a commotion in the Plaza.<br /><br />A server comes by and is escorting 2 people to a table thats nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra and Kord (Who both stayed and are hewlping rebuild and deal with teh city.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord grumbles to Avandra...&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what ioun thought would happen, but I've got work to do, why tcan't that guy ever say what's on his damn mind?"<br /><br />We don't recognize Simone's new form.&nbsp; <br /><br />Glee is definately acting nervous and has a ring on her hand.&nbsp; She's very nervous, fidgets the ring.&nbsp; She recognizes Admatha and myself.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas starts to say something and there is a shift in the air and a formless being appears nearby, coalesces into a 9 ft tall creature of chains.&nbsp;&nbsp; They surround Glee, who freaks out, and from the next table over someone spits out their beer, and Kord says Holy<br /><br />This attack is not like when Grazzt was there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of tearing the target apart, the gnome starts withering really quick... faster than what Joe usually does.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra bounds to her feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes widen and she exlaims why the hells is she here?&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't seem immediately intent on protecting the gnome.&nbsp; Kord replies he doesn't know but he's gonna do something about this...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord rteaches to his wrist abnd produces a link of a chain and brandishes it.&nbsp; And says "Get lost"&nbsp;&nbsp; and the link of the chain flashes, and the being seems to acknowledge that Kord did this and is present, but hardly even hesitates.&nbsp; Kord looks pissed that what he tried to do failed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone is going to look terrified and look at the mass of chains.&nbsp; <br /><br />Undernearth the chains are kinda like shadows...&nbsp; Those chains grabbed Simone before, She suddenly realizes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I look around...&nbsp; There are some other high ranking figures...&nbsp;&nbsp; Sibyls around having a ;lunch, kinda like...&nbsp;&nbsp; wtf? on her face.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like what's going on, we fixed this thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas Looks about as phased as usual by eremely unusual things...&nbsp; but less phased them she probably should, given what's going on righjt next to her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She stads up and backs away and has her hand on the sword.&nbsp;&nbsp; a "Yeah, this might get out of hand and then I'd have to do something" kinda look.&nbsp; Maybe a quirk of amusement, too, because its interesting.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha grabs the gnome.&nbsp; And attempts to teleport her away.&nbsp;&nbsp; But jerks her hand away.&nbsp; Round ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gnome falls apart into a withered husk.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see strange energy flow from her into the chain being, then the being shrinks in on itself and is gone.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was pretty disturbed<br /><br />About this time, everyone else starts to react.&nbsp;&nbsp; There starts being a panic...&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord leaps up on a table and yells for people to calm down.&nbsp; Sibyl starts trying to calm the crowd... that everything's safe, etc.<br /><br />Kord asks Kas what the hell she's playing at.&nbsp; She's lkike... what?&nbsp;&nbsp; We decide to go elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord teleports all of us.&nbsp; We're teleported somehwere quiet...&nbsp; that high class palce we were at before the battle.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're at the front desk and we say we need a room now, and the receptionist is like absolutely!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We immediately prepare a private room.&nbsp; Kord looks pissed, Kas Looks relaxed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone looks unsettled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admatha is not quite calmbut is trying to present herself as such.&nbsp; Avandra says to Kord "Kord...&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened there?"&nbsp;&nbsp; And he's like 'How should I know?&nbsp;&nbsp; I used the thing, but it didn't work. "&nbsp;&nbsp; he says it makes it so that monster doesn't do whatever she wants.&nbsp; Kord considers whether or not to say and Avandras like tell them and Kord is like yeah, ok, I don't care.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Both Kord and Pelor have those chain link charms.<br /><br />Its a long story Kord says.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kord says, eying Kas, "I suspect you know too...&nbsp;&nbsp; but.. How are you aleays here when these things happen!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's like right place right time.&nbsp; Willing to wait about whatever she called us about.<br /><br />Kord says he's gonna tell us some stuff and we can't share it.&nbsp; He says he won't make us swear an oath and all that.&nbsp;&nbsp; but in light of what's happening, anything we might know might help so he tells us his hand.<br /><br />He says That being is called the lady of pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Until recently, we thought she was our servent through and through.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her job was protecting Sigil, keeping it together.&nbsp;&nbsp; but recently we learned she's a duplicitous bitch.&nbsp; Somehow she established enough of her own free will to start taking ona&nbsp;&nbsp; a divine portfolio...&nbsp;&nbsp; she's been judging hte dead and doing stuff the raven queen had been for a while.&nbsp; She is the raven queen.&nbsp;&nbsp; When they created her, iin order to do what she did she had to be strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can't revoke the portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp; It can't be done, but Pelor spent a long time trying.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha says The raven queen is connected to the chained god.<br /><br />Kord says the Humans overstepped themselves, so they fought back and hte like.&nbsp;&nbsp; at their head, their leader... even after they'd stopped them, after they thought they had completely one, the chained god, in his last act of defiance, granted her divinity.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they had to bind her to the temple, that's what made it all work.&nbsp; So they each gave a little piece of themselves and they each got one of those chain links.&nbsp; Nerull does not have one.&nbsp;&nbsp; (THose that have them are the ones in the temple of the murals.)&nbsp; Kord says that those of the gods who built that place...&nbsp;&nbsp; there are the elder gods and the new ones.&nbsp; the elders have chains.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra sneers when he calls her a young god.&nbsp; 20 of the gods did the thing. (Each gave up some of their divine rank...)<br /><br />Kord says Admatha hit the nail on the head.&nbsp;&nbsp; Raven queen professed her love and he saw fit to give her the power.&nbsp; Whatever she became, they didn't want ot even find out.&nbsp;&nbsp; They jsut bound her power to the tower, that makes this all possible... the flow, all of us...&nbsp;&nbsp; all derives from him and from her.&nbsp; So whatever kind of meddling crap is going on here...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the only way she could have resisted my command is if some other god gave her a counter order...&nbsp;&nbsp; probably about 2...&nbsp; lest he could overpower.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha asks about the younger gods.&nbsp; Avandra replies.&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiles and is pleased Admatha asked.&nbsp; says "all of us new gods, to my knowledge were mortal once.&nbsp;&nbsp; that power is there for the taking for those willing to do so."&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord says "Yeah, maybe, but it aint easy...&nbsp; the others won't take kindly to attempts to do that."&nbsp;&nbsp; Avdandra nods and says she was like us once, looking us over.&nbsp; That essence can be earned.<br /><br />But that's what the humans were trying to do, and Kord is like "Exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra doesn't know what's going on with her.<br /><br />We ask Kas why we were brought here.&nbsp; <br /><br />As we're talking, Kord isn't listening, grabs both ends of the link and stretches it and whips a circle which forms into a portal and a shimmering portal appears and he steps through and reaches to the edge of the portal and pulls the chain and the portal collapses.<br /><br />We're like presumably we were to talk to Glee and Glee was killed to prevent sharing of her knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says That Glee wanted to ask Kas for protection from that thing, which isn't something I can do.&nbsp; Kas clearly knows more than she's saying.&nbsp;&nbsp; Says that if we believe what Kord told us than there are gods who are ordering htem to do it.&nbsp; Once the portal is closed, she looks genuinly disgusted.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask why they wanted to kill Glee.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says she's not entirely sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can only imagine it has somethign to do with retribution.&nbsp; Kas gives Admatha a knowing look.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra isn't surprised Glee went to Kas.&nbsp; Kas says that what the old gods isn't necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp; she looks human maybe with a fiendish air.&nbsp;&nbsp; not like being a tiefling probably...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at most, a tiefling (Old style tieflings.)&nbsp; More like demonic bloodline a la unearthed arcana.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says I wonder what kord expects he'll find.&nbsp;&nbsp; We think maybe which god gave the order... she's like of course, but going and asking them... maybe they'll deny it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask what good it would even do to know.&nbsp; Avandra says she isn't really sure.&nbsp; Says Kord isn't one to care about politics, but when theyu effect him like this he's upset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He's worried about this...&nbsp;&nbsp; he must have been rattled to just leave like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas Shakes her head and looks disgusted.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which power"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask what.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the portal. They obtained that power roughly, basically.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says she doens't need to leave that way, has to go home the old fashioned way.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask who the shapeshifters tried to kill.&nbsp;&nbsp; Io was the first.&nbsp; There was the attempt on Ehlonna.&nbsp; Kas thinks that's probably all.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone asks where the shapeshifters came from.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says its an interesting quesiton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentions plenty of people have objection with what the gods have done.&nbsp; Aroudn this time Admatha realizes that Nymph is Simone.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask how long the shapeshifters have been around,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says its hard to say,.&nbsp;&nbsp; They really havenm't been very active that she's noticed until recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She's a little flattered that they decided to use her sword.&nbsp; We get the impression she's mostly saying it out of spite towards the gods.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't really care that they stole it, and she is actually a bit flattered.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says she can't beleive the shapeshifters stayed under the radar so long.&nbsp; Avandra says Vecna should probably know because it was a secret.&nbsp;&nbsp; He says they must have been around for thousands of years, based on new information that came to light.&nbsp; Kas looks a bit disgusted and is like I know who..<br /><br />We ask what else we know about them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas shrugs and says that you would have been in a better position than I would have.(To Simone).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Empty words are passed back and forth.<br /><br />We ask what she wanted to tell us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says she wanted us to see first hand what happens when gods do things that effect everyone.&nbsp; Avandra says "You certainly seemt o know a lot about them" 'I suppose.'&nbsp; "Did you know that was going ot happen?"&nbsp; 'Right place right time'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says it like its believeable, but she says it all the time...&nbsp; its stretching plausibility.&nbsp;&nbsp; The timing was a little bit too perfect.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask kas what she knows of the raven queen.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says shes a god of the dead.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinks abotu it a bit more...&nbsp;&nbsp; "One of your comrades worships her if I last recall...&nbsp;&nbsp; thinks a bit mroe then nods again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kord said a great deal that I imagine very few knew."&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra asks if Kas kenw that before hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas shrugs.&nbsp; She wasn't surprised to learn any of that.<br /><br />Kas says she's been in contact with some people who've had something to do with her for a while.&nbsp; And then of course there was the incident at oraculum with Grazzts murder.&nbsp; Notably, kas wasn't trhere.<br /><br /><br />Avandra says that's what let the cat out fo the bag...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her showing up there is what made us realize that she wasn't under our control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says that means it must have been important.&nbsp; <br /><br />(Jeff Calls that Kas is totally Tharis dune's avatar)<br /><br />No visions on Kas for Simone.&nbsp; There's a strange void.&nbsp; But the gods can be seen.&nbsp; <br /><br />No other attacks like those against Glee.&nbsp; We ask if raven queen's been up to anything lately.&nbsp;&nbsp; kas says why should she know.&nbsp;&nbsp; We sense that something rang wrong about whether or not there have been any other attacks.&nbsp; She knows about what I asked...&nbsp; She definately knows a lot.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask why were were called again.&nbsp; She thinks.&nbsp; "I just wanted to talk.. philospyh, gods."&nbsp; She really did want to talk to us about the gods... and that was part of the reason to ask us to stop by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra says if you want to trash talk the other gods, its fine with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't part of their plan.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says ""Well, I suppose if Avandra doesn't mind if I talk abotu the gods the way things actually are, I can do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They did a lot of terrible things.&nbsp;&nbsp; They're generally reprehensible people.&nbsp; Well, all of the old ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; And if it were up to me, th elady of pain would be free of her enslavement, an dif it were up to me, the chained god would never have been enslaved int he first place. "&nbsp;&nbsp; We ask how many other gods were human.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most is Kas' reply.<br /><br />Admatha says that many of htem would have reason to sympathize with this belief whether they'd voice it or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says its possible.&nbsp; Avandra says most of hte gods really are what they look like.. Yondalla is a halfling...&nbsp; for instance.&nbsp;&nbsp; most of the younger gods are human.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some managed to grab the power before others ascended.&nbsp; But not all gods are as bloodthirsty as us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was supposed to be a term of surrender that our people would NOT be wiped out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas looks a little annoyed that the gods broke that promise but confirms it.&nbsp; <br /><br />She says she worships the god of vengeance, and wants vengeance, wants some of the gods done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that's whyt he changeling thought she could find safety with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask after achieving that, then what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says, well, the younger gods are blameless, they'd pick up the slack, hopefulyl do something more responsible with the power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandras like some of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says maybe if the Lady of pain were freed, she could bring back humanity.&nbsp; Or maybe thats not possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; <br /><br />It could be becoming common knowledge that Zahar returned to humanity.&nbsp; Eventually everyone'll figure it out.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask why she's called the lady of Pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says maybe because she's in eternal torment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask who gave her that title.&nbsp; She doesn't know who gave her the name.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone asks how Demogorgon is tied to Sigil.&nbsp; (Kas might not know!&nbsp;&nbsp; DM consult...&nbsp;&nbsp; probably?).&nbsp;&nbsp; She says Demogorgon was formed at the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; They originally used magic to try and take the magic of the temple for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its one of those things people did...&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the reasons the lady of pain was enslaved the way she was...&nbsp;&nbsp; demogorgon was the result.<br /><br />Avandra looks like she learned something new here.&nbsp; (Kord seemed really wary of Kas, but Avandra is more like kinda wary but also curious.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's an adventurer.)<br /><br />Simone asks how many times Sigil was rebuilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says its a tricky question, flow is tricky.&nbsp;&nbsp; thinks some more.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tower was only built once.&nbsp;&nbsp; *thinks more.(=]*&nbsp;&nbsp; Twice?&nbsp;&nbsp; *shrug*<br /><br />Avandra says she asked some of the other gods...&nbsp;&nbsp; Boccob...&nbsp;&nbsp; He was kinda cagey about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early days of the flow, before the temple was built, things were strange.&nbsp; Everything only works the way it is now because of sigil though.&nbsp;&nbsp; THere was flow before there was sigil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas Smiles and says "Was there ever..."&nbsp; (Like yeah, a shit ton.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So sigil manages it, but there was a time when there was no flow...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently this was part of a whole process of the chained god thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra sounds kinda unsure and doesn't fully understand this.&nbsp; Kas clearly seems to acknowledge such a time existed.<br /><br />Avandra says that a lot of the gods don't seem like bad people.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says 'Like Boccob'?&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas calls him a god of secrecy and lies (Typically not his portfolio.).&nbsp;&nbsp; avandra is like yeah, they're kinda entiteled.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says that she hates kord less, but says that Boccob is one who typically misuses his authority over the lady of pain...&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps he was the one responsible behind this, but who knows?<br /><br />I ask Kas Why she refers to Boccob as Vecna's portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says they're the same.&nbsp; Avandra says that she respects that vecna managed to cutthroat himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra says that she expected hextor and heironeous to do it first.<br /><br />Boccob took Vecna's power.&nbsp; Kas isn't defending Vecna...&nbsp;&nbsp; says that the ideology behind stealing divine power is...&nbsp; distasteful.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I mention that its not dissimilar formt he chained gods situation, he says that they were willign to overlook transgressions liek this since it was soon after the temple, and they wanted to make sure everyone supported the temple.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says "Well, I guess its a good hting they succeeded.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you disagree, but that time... it was a very messy time."&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone says that now is messy, Kas is like yea.&nbsp; Avandra:&nbsp; "Now the gods are who they are...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back then, it was cutthroat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the flow began, the gods realized they had to contend with new eidolons that just came into being.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way pelor explained it, they were all scared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine...&nbsp; they were used toa&nbsp; world where there was just one of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you suddenly have competitors claiming to be you, wielding your powers....&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand what they did. They had to protect themselves. "&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />They built Sigil to manage to flow to keep themselves more singluar.<br /><br />Kas smiles and says that if it werent' for their atrocities it wouldn't have been a problem in the first place.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says yeah... it was kinda their own fault.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says 'Only a little bit, though, far be it from us to hold them accountable.' *Bitterly.*&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra is like I don't want to be judgemental.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra wants to drop the topic since she wasn't there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And as (Simone says)&nbsp; What's done is done.&nbsp;&nbsp; But don't tell that to St. Cuthbert.&nbsp; <br /><br />2 priorities:&nbsp; keeping Oraculum organized, and figuring out whatever else Asmodeus is up to.&nbsp; Second one probably a bit more what you're going after *To Kas, from simone*<br /><br />Kas thinks:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stopping Asmodeus from stopping whatevers going on is probably a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; That, I can agree evenw itht he old gods about."&nbsp; <br /><br />Simoen:&nbsp; "What do any of us know what Asmodeus is up to."&nbsp; I ask about overlapping portolios, Kas says they squabble.&nbsp; (Asmodeus being another liar.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says... Let's see...&nbsp;&nbsp; Boccob and vecna stole eachothers power... there was the moradin incident...&nbsp; who am I forgetting...&nbsp; (Right, Levistus is a Moradin Eidolon).&nbsp; Admatha gives a glare.&nbsp; <br /><br />Hextor and Heir are eidolons of eachother...&nbsp;&nbsp; confirmed by Avandra.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra says they claim to be brothers...&nbsp;&nbsp; but there didn't used to be two.<br /><br />Admatha asks if there are any other such pairs or similar.&nbsp; Avandra says she thinks most of them were killed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says In squabbles...<br /><br />Sehanine and Lloth?&nbsp;&nbsp; Says Admatha.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says That would make things even more ironic, wouldn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp; But I don't think so.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says Corellon never talks about that except to say they were sisters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that was from before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra asks what the underdark says.&nbsp; The underdark says that Sehanine and Corellon betrayed lloth and her people and now their stuck in the underdark because htey need the inverted nexuses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And specifically, Corellon betrayed Lloth and chose her less worthy sister over her, and as part of that rejection caused lloths Curse.<br /><br />Avandra looks a bit uncomfortable and changes the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says that most of the eidolons of the gods killed eachother or somehow made peice with it like hextor/heironeous.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says 'How civilized.'&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says Shall we talk about why that betrayal occured?&nbsp;&nbsp; Would it matter to those of the underdark?<br /><br />Kas:&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I recall correctly, and it was a while ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was because when genocide was declared against hte humans, Lloths weren't keen on it."&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas isn't lying, and she does know, and she is personally upset.&nbsp;&nbsp; This really gets under her skin and is definately a sticking point. "And because they refused to genocide."&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says the nexuses quickly changed to fall out of balance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says that they didn't manage to exterminate all the humans.&nbsp;&nbsp; some became tieflings under Lloths wing...&nbsp;&nbsp; the tieflings claim to have made a contract with Asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps the tieflings chose a lesser curse (Being cursed to not refresh and refresh and negs, the latter is better, so they took that willingly.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra asks what Kas' plan is.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Make another sowrd?&nbsp;&nbsp; One for each of them?"&nbsp;&nbsp; 'The flow has already demonstrated I don't need to do that.'&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, if you can find that."&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I could do that.'<br /><br />We ask about the lack of nexuses and hte hells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says that tearing a world from the flow makes it a dead world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Asmodeus or the others do so as well.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Avandra looks like she's thoghtful abotu what would make a hell happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't know for certain.&nbsp;&nbsp; she ponders.&nbsp; She doesn't know.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask if there are multiple hells, does everytime Asmodeus wins, a new layer created?&nbsp;&nbsp; or were there multiple to begin with,.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says THere was only 1 world before the flow...&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you could look at them as different worlds, i guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; If all the nexuses here and the flow here were destroyed, that might not be the case for all worlds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says that the ordering brings all of that back into question.<br /><br />Avandra says the ordering is terrifying.&nbsp;&nbsp; But other than that, the flow is an explosion of possibilites.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />There is at least a world with the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you could pull out layers, but... Asmodeus couldn't really win and take over everything... there will always be more worlds.&nbsp; Kas says That's unless he can do it to all worlds at once... which is why the ordering is so scary.<br /><br />Simone says there are other things that violate that rule...&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the dragon orbs.&nbsp; Singular things.&nbsp; Things that move in the flow but are not multiplied by it.&nbsp; Something else occurs to Simone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Namely, she recalls a situation where some stuff that had happened had suddenly never happened.&nbsp; It was like an erosion of the flow itself.&nbsp; Something had changed in a way that things that had happened never did.&nbsp; (Another time did this and it wasn't actually.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Simoen mentions that she's had one other experience where something that had happened had been erased as a possibility...&nbsp; after a wierd feeling quake.&nbsp; But she doesn't know who caused it or how or why.&nbsp; I bring up the other wone with Calenon having done it.<br /><br />Kas and avandra say it sounds like the ordering.&nbsp; Avandra's pretty sure that that's not how it works.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says maybe its the chained god reaching out doing something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says she doesn't really know.&nbsp; Simone says its something that could be used to restrict possibilities.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas shrugs when I mention that It could be Asmodeus behind it.&nbsp; She does not appear to believe that asmodeus was necessarily behind all of it, but she seems prone to believe that his goals would be served with this.&nbsp;&nbsp; SO if he wasn't, he will be.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus is hated byt he other gods and is attacked.&nbsp; Avandra says all she knows is it happened during the war of the gods.&nbsp; (Heh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, Ehlonna told Biger that Asmodeus was once human and is a good example of what would have happened if Theris Dune hadn't been imprisoned.&nbsp; <br /><br />We asked how Asmodeus got his thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas thinks about it a long time.&nbsp; And she says that Asmodeus was human and obtained divinity much the same way as Demogorgon obtained its power.&nbsp; there was a rite performed at the temple that allowed a great deal of power to be taken from it.&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was...&nbsp; *And she gives a look at biger.*&nbsp;&nbsp; And thats how she cursed the tyemple so no one could see what's going on there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Garl managed to catch on.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait, but Garl said Asmodeus cursed the temple."<br /><br />Kas says "She did.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was one of the copies of the chained god's general.&nbsp; one of the ones who was not chosen [for godhood]&nbsp;&nbsp; was jealous, used the temple tog et power, then cursed it so she would know about it. "<br /><br />Avandra is totally stunned.&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is ridiculous.&nbsp;&nbsp; But... The other gods...&nbsp;&nbsp; No one knows how he came to be?&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you know this? Who the hell are you?" to Kas.&nbsp; Kas shrugs *Avandra looks kinda angry.*&nbsp; Kas appears to have significant faith in what she knows.&nbsp; However she found out, she believes it is reliable.<br /><br />Is st cuthbert feeding you this information?&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you'd fill us in on St Cuthbert's origin since none of us know that either!&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra says why would she know.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas is trying to express she doesn't.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're like shouldn't you know?&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas is like good point.&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume he was around at the time...<br /><br />Avandra is like "Damn divination block.&nbsp;&nbsp; cuthbert is a Coward."&nbsp; Avandra says she has nothing to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says she has plenty to hide.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone is surprised that no one knows anything about like all of these new gods.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are some new gods who just kind of appeared.&nbsp; Some gods no one knows the origin before.&nbsp; Perhaps they're eidolons, impersonating eachother?&nbsp; Avandra goes on her rant about all them.&nbsp;&nbsp; cuthbert, raven queen, nerull, Asmodeus... no one knows their origins.&nbsp; <br /><br />We ask if it was bestowed on them.<br /><br />Until recently, no on ehad even seen the raven queen in person.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra says at least Nerull shows its face from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp; More than I can say about Cuthbert.&nbsp; <br /><br />She's like Cuthbert's a coward.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm like maybe you've been hanging around kord too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; She acknowledges htis and half-apologizes.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Vance/vacob situation is like things woven around.<br /><br />Avandra :&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiaransalee (The real name of the raven queen) not only is the raven queen, but her eidolons became both demogorgon and asmodeus in different ways.<br /><br />Kas thinks and says I suppose that's more or less what I'm thinking of.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says and so when one was given divinity, the others were left out?<br /><br />Kas: And they partook in that game of the golds of stealing eachothers divine essences.<br /><br />Avandra says there's an integrative effect in some places.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />We're like Asmodeus wants to create yet another hell, presumably.&nbsp; Or maybe introduce the flow into the hells, or make hell infinite.<br /><br />Asmodeus is female, according to Kas....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he has the same source as Demogorgon.<br /><br /><br />Avandras like we could ask the source.&nbsp; Kas:&nbsp;&nbsp; The gods or Asmodeus.&nbsp; Avandra clarifies asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas is on board.<br /><br />Lots of shrugging all round.&nbsp; Kas says "Well, assuming Asmodeus doesn't carry it with her, she may have the other orb with her.&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you happen to raid her and her sanctum and get away with an orb, she'll certainly come looking for you... or send someone to do so for her."&nbsp; <br /><br />The priests of Io would probably have it.&nbsp; <br /><br />We're like maybe lure them out by getting the orb.&nbsp; eventually she'll run out of places.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says she wasn't&nbsp; planning on going her self.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone says why not?&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas shrugs and says Its bound ot be unplleasant, I'm not exactly dressed for it *Taps the empty sword scabbard. Simone asks if that's the only problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KAs says well, I suppose that really get in my way...&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been thinking about getting together some peopel to deal with deific problems, and Asmodeus is on the top of hte list.<br /><br />Simone asks if this makes her different fromt he gods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She says she doesn't intend on stealing a gods power or commit genocide.&nbsp; She says she likes those lines to not cross.&nbsp; But, if we'd rather wait around and see if Asmodeus succeeds.&nbsp; <br /><br />This conversation substantially evolved, from where it started.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wasn't talking about Asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avandra suggested it.&nbsp; but she didn't say she wanted us to do the thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; She never really asked us.&nbsp; She thinks asmodeus is worse now than at the beginning of the conversation.<br /><br />Simoen says if its that important why don't you take part? *To Kas*<br /><br />Admatha:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or, what would you be doin gin the meantime?"&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says "If you're inclined to go after asmodeus and stop her... namely, rewriting hte flow, I would be willing to assist you."&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention I'd be willing to help stop Asmodeus <br /><br />We get a vibe from Kas that she has a mission (Kill all the gods.)&nbsp; And that Asmodeus isn't really part of this, which is probabyl why she's not keen on joining the trip.&nbsp; If she dies, who carries her work on.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />Avandra claps her hands:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sounds like we founda&nbsp; thing we can all get behind."&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says "we might not want to consider straight frontal assault you know..."<br /><br />Like Simone said, Hell si a big place.&nbsp; there are a lot of angles, and Asmodeus is the master of those angles.&nbsp;&nbsp; THere's a lot of unrest among the devil lords.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says she likes the flying city.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas wants to see the old gods eliminated.&nbsp; We also view asmodeus as the most pertinant and current threat, and you'd advise raiding her domain, see if she's got the orb or other big artifacts, take them, draw her attention, draw her out.&nbsp; Nobody seems to know anything about her really.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's kina a nameless chaos face thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully we'll draw her out somehow.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says so, what the question is...&nbsp;&nbsp; are we willing to give it a go.&nbsp; I say yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone thinks.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says she'd like to help but is most concerned about travelling to hell itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that she's afraid, but... the world works differently there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are various portals there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas Smiles and says "If I had a guess where the portal was, I would say it would have to be in or near the cursed temple."&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone asks the story about the thing guarding that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says it wasn't there to start with.&nbsp;&nbsp; its eaten a lot of people.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says... are you suggesting,....?&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be brilliant!&nbsp;&nbsp; if anythign could eat asmodeus whole, it would be that.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says that some of us have been there.&nbsp; Admatha says she has...&nbsp;&nbsp; they each require a different entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas Nods.<br /><br />Avandra says maybe we could ask an ally for advice...&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone says searching the temple grounds could be dangerous because we'd be found out and quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says we make a good point.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The devils were shredded... the ones in the temple.)&nbsp; <br /><br />Simonme asks if this is why The temple is considered off limits... the curse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says she doesn't know exactly what it does... but she knows what some of the things are allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Garl figured out the curse. <br /><br />Kas knows somethign was done to the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; She says it prevents anything happening without Asmodeus knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She suspects that may be where the hellish entrance is which may or may not be part of the curse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she imagines that one way or another it would allow her to move her people.&nbsp; <br /><br />I mention it was easy to leave...&nbsp; Kas says true.&nbsp; <br /><br />We mention the farce we were exposed to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the curse extends beyond that, it must be subtle, or the gods would have known... someone would have triggered it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Eliminating the curse may remove the portal.&nbsp; <br /><br />Perhaps it would be easier to pass through another hell...&nbsp; <br /><br />If we use the one in Sigil, she'll know.<br /><br />Kas says there's another issue.&nbsp; The temple in the hells is the one you'd need to use as the gate.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admathas like no fucking way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says she hasn't seen it, Admatha's like no Effing way.&nbsp; She says that's wher ethe gate was.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her understanding is that the portals exist in the same place in the hells..&nbsp;&nbsp; if we go through them throught he portal to our realm.&nbsp; That would make the portal to the 9th layer in that temple... so if we go through from here we end up there, or if we go there througha ny layer of hell, but fromt he 9th layer, would come into the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp; so if we passed through to baalzebul's layer, travel to the factory and find the portal there... that could be a problem.<br /><br />Admatha says its the devil factory.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra says this is why she suggested playing the devil lords around.<br /><br />(Levistus and Baalzebul).&nbsp; <br /><br />It sounds like there's an overwhelming force that wants to take Asmodeus down.&nbsp;&nbsp; but much of it can't risk losing and much of it has motivation to play both sides.<br /><br />Kas: Don't forget that the gods are willing to side with anyone willing to side with anyone to kill another god.<br /><br />We suspect Kas' sowrd would work in the hells...&nbsp;&nbsp; ah, and hte sword must be moved by mundane means.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kas says that is nearly true.<br /><br />Kas says it would be dangerous for anyone but a swordbearer,...&nbsp;&nbsp; someone to whom the sword has been entrusted.&nbsp; By destiny.&nbsp; maybe Tharis Dune... beign the god of destiny.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />She says the flow puts it in the hands of one who needs it...&nbsp; <br /><br />Kas says if the sword is needed to kill asmodeus, no doubt it will be where it needs to be.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha looks profoundly thoughtful.&nbsp; <br /><br />Avandra just remembered.&nbsp; When theyu spoke to iuoun, he bid that he give someone a message, presumably all of you... what was it...<br /><br />"he said... expect troubled dreams tonight but do not discount them, frightening though they maybe."&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha asks Biger if he dreams, I'm like no.&nbsp; <br /><br />kas says right, well, breakfast tomorrow.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha was like By siumone, Biger is like totally yeah.<br /><br />I'm like...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good to see [avandra] recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp; She's like... it was... unnerving.&nbsp; <br /><br />There's a littkle ironwood tree as a home for the edchidnox.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tree is being fed well but not a lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simone talks to the echidnox.&nbsp;&nbsp; She makes her rounds to all the beaurucrats.&nbsp; Introduces herself and inserts herself into the political field.&nbsp; There's tension and she offscreens keeping the city running well.&nbsp; She smooths tons of stuff over and establishes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Oraculum is shaping up to be the melting pot of the world.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha and I have a conversation.&nbsp; She says...&nbsp; <br /><br />When we leave Avandra's presence.&nbsp;&nbsp; We go to her room.&nbsp; <br /><br />She says she knows which god ordered the lady of pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was nerull.&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask why she thinks it was done.&nbsp;&nbsp; She doesn't knwo the motivation, but when she touched the shapeshifter, it wasn't the ravenqueens energy.&nbsp;&nbsp; it was the power that she uses.&nbsp; <br /><br />I say maybe the two are connected.&nbsp;&nbsp; and she asked Kas quietly if she knew knew nerull's Origins and she said no..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So Admatha suspects that its not another eidolon of Asmodeus.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />She says she plans to do what she can to see if nerull has any strong wishes about her involvement in the current course of actions... so far, she has heard very little from nerull int he past year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing about course of action.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />I ask if maybe nerull was being quiet was because nerull was subsumed by the Raven queen.&nbsp; She feels that's unlikely... she probably would have sensed something having happened to Nerull...&nbsp;&nbsp; nerull has not been 'stabbed in the face' so to speak.&nbsp; <br /><br />She says if she's running counter to the will of her deity...&nbsp; then...&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah.&nbsp; <br /><br />I tell Admatha that the raven queen is who was porting us about the hells.<br /><br />In chapter 3, the gods have been shown that they need to take more active of a rule, so we all have the opportunity to recieve a vision from a god.&nbsp;&nbsp; We pick the god and question out of character.&nbsp;&nbsp; IC we don't choose.&nbsp; They will give us an answer to the question we ask them as far as they know.<br /><br />Potential question:&nbsp;&nbsp; "How does Kas know all of this shit."&nbsp;&nbsp; But who the hell do we ask.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ioun is more like the truth of events, but boccob is more the truth of the universe.&nbsp; <br />(Theris Dune is azathoth).<br />What is asmodeus proud of?&nbsp; Ask Asmodeus or Lloth or Tharis dune about the binding.&nbsp; <br />What deals did Asmodeus make with the gods?<br /><br />Jeff Asks Tharis Dune "Who his allies are. "&nbsp; <br /><br />For the first time in my existance, I experience a waking nightmare.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't shut down or anything but I lose track of my surroundings, and my sensory input is from this vision, so I'm dreaming or somewhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp; I find myself in the center of a dining room table.&nbsp; there are many figures seated there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Biger himself has been pulled open in different places and different people are pulling out parts that I know to be function.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am notably afraid... I am being quite literally pulled apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; but I can see several faces.&nbsp;&nbsp; I see Kireensley several times...&nbsp;&nbsp; not sure how many.&nbsp;&nbsp; "here have some biger, it's quite delicious."&nbsp; I'm passed to Erics Goldsmith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Passed to Kas, Passed to Sahret (Evil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dubain.) another Kiransely, passed to a woman who is just a hag, horribly withered, on the bring of falling over dead (Not Wee Jas.)...&nbsp;&nbsp; this woman has a horrific appearance.&nbsp; I've seen this person before?&nbsp;&nbsp; in Sigil red 10...&nbsp; It looks like one of the people I saw in the temple of sigil but much mroe withered...&nbsp;&nbsp; It's Sehanine... not the real one, but the one who appeared in the temple in Red 10.&nbsp; Its that same psychic signiture.&nbsp; I'm passed to another Kiransely.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then passed to a very majestic and beautiful fey woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've never encountered anyone or anything like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then passed to another woman, who is definately Wee Jas, beyond all doubt. Then passed to various other figures whoa re kind of shrouded.&nbsp; If I had to guess, they don't exist or aren't allies yet but inevitably will be, and all throughout there's this sense of trying to draw me in/recruit me/rejoin him... integrate with those people.&nbsp; Isaline and Joe might be among the shrouded figures, but it's really hard to say.&nbsp; <br /><br />Curts Comments:&nbsp; The majestic fey woman reminds me of Ehlonna but is not Ehlonna.&nbsp; Also, I make a will save and get 55.&nbsp; I am struggling to try and see what's really going on and hwo the shrouded figures are.&nbsp;&nbsp; Faces are blurring past.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is less and less of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; at the end of the table all thats left is my head.&nbsp; there's a figure theere.&nbsp;&nbsp; It picks me up and pulls me closer and as I get closer, I see its Joe.&nbsp;&nbsp; and he says, smiling down at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Don't Worry Biger, through our digestion will be your rebirth.'&nbsp; I awaken in whatever is equivalent to a cold sweat for warforged.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Andy asks Ioun: "What are Kas' Origins"<br /><br />Simone's Vision: She goes to sleep kibnd of expecting troubled dreams.&nbsp; Her mind is racing and she finds herself fixated on teh question of who is Kas...&nbsp;&nbsp; spiraling out of control...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kinda hyperventilating in her dream.&nbsp; Then a calming presence washes over her and Ioun is there.&nbsp; He says 'Simone, i sense your determination and focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; You wish to know an answer to a question even the gods have struggled with.&nbsp;&nbsp; and even one such as myself has seen nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it is important that I tell you what I do know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot show you because there is nothing to show.&nbsp;&nbsp; but know this.&nbsp; Fate, destiny, the flow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all stems from one place... the all father, from his prison...&nbsp;&nbsp; this reality flows forth.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have studied it for longer than I can even remember now, and I assure you that the only way something could be so totally blocked from me and my abilities and visions...&nbsp;&nbsp; is when it comes from -him-.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I know, even though I have not seen it, beyond a doubt, that the one called Kas is a vital piece of the puzzle of the chained god.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not his servent directly, then someone of utmost importance to the flow and destiny.&nbsp; We gods like to pretend we control this world.&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is not that simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not drive the reigns of fate.&nbsp;&nbsp; we can merely steer them from time to time.&nbsp; and it is the same witih anyone, with all of you.&nbsp; But know that to unravel the mystery of Kas would be to unravel one of the great mysteries int he universe, so I bid you the best of luck in this quest and will do the best that I can to Aid.' Simone thanks him in like a lucid dream.&nbsp; He nods and everything fades back to normal sleep.&nbsp; And he has a sense of caution and prudence emanating from ioun...&nbsp;&nbsp; patience...&nbsp;&nbsp; he's not advising any rashness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also gets a sense of fatalism...&nbsp;&nbsp; What will be known will be known.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is inevitable it will come out, but that doesn't mean that what you're doing doesn't matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His perspective is that what must be will be, throught eh will of the living (different from the nomads).&nbsp; The opposite of a self-fulfilling prophecy.&nbsp; Simone's quest to uncover this truth witll do so, and its kinda reassuring.&nbsp; The answer does exist... and for reals no one knows.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />Alex asks Nerull "What's your origin story?"&nbsp; <br /><br />Emotion: fear<br />Admatha's Vision shows Theris dune and (Asmodeus)&nbsp;&nbsp; and Theris dune imbuild her with his power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Theris dune is a man, human, tall, muscular, powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; he has a sense of incredible wisdom among him, balding... an older man.&nbsp; The woman is human, she looks to be a warrior.&nbsp; platemail, combat garb...&nbsp; Like an erinyes in the Pathfinder bestiary.&nbsp;&nbsp; He imbues her with incredible amounts of power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene shifts, she's cornered by the other gods, she is ritually tied down.&nbsp;&nbsp; each of the gods is standing there, and htere is a shcakle and a chain that goes there, the one link stays and the others go to form the lady of pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within the lady of pain there was still an entity and that entity's shadow.&nbsp;&nbsp; the Shadow is nerull.&nbsp; The entity is Presumably the Raven queen.&nbsp; There was another god there who looked like an old woman, and when she imbued her power that's where a lot of it came from.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wee Jas giving up her power was intentional.&nbsp;&nbsp; that old woman kinda Uweeh he he. kinda thing... like 'theres something extra I want this to be able to do, so i'm going to give it to do this."&nbsp;&nbsp; THe gods clearly knew they were creating a bound god.&nbsp; They didn't know about Nerull, but Wee Jas was... she was more aware of anyone else.&nbsp; "exxxcelent' kinda thing, btu the other gods didn't know Nerull was being created.&nbsp; THere is also possibly the assumptionm that Wee Jas may have been more powerful to begin with... she had mroe to give.&nbsp; The gods gave a substantial fraction of their own power...&nbsp;&nbsp; not merely 1/20th.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the eidolons of Asmodeus all feel stronger than all of them...&nbsp;&nbsp; Nerull may well be the strongest god.<br /><br />They have both stepped in more recently to take in more aspects of the previous goddess of death who kinda stopped being active...&nbsp;&nbsp; together they usurped someone elses portfolio...&nbsp;&nbsp; well, not quite.&nbsp; Wee Jas is at the moment kinda keeping quiet... not many followers adn the like...&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe the raven queen and Nerull have kinda taken over Wee jas' stuff.&nbsp; She was the old goddess of death.&nbsp; Wee Jas does have shrines but not really priests.&nbsp;&nbsp; The shrines exist in particular within the empire and the underdark.&nbsp; Anyone who tampers with them, are...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well, bad things happen.&nbsp; Well, nerull and the Raven queen do hate eachother.<br /><br /><br /></p>
