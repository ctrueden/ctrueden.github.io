      <p><br /><br />Fugue!&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />The stands are filled with devils.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are excited, but quiet.&nbsp; <br /><br />Zahar&nbsp; came with us but is gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />The pits be about 100 feet deep.&nbsp; <br /><br />There are various openings about the wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some are large, some are ludicrously so.&nbsp; <br /><br />It is not just us in a pit with her looking down..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we hear crowd sounds all around us.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is clearly a spectator sport.&nbsp; <br /><br />Some of the devils shout mortal scum!&nbsp;&nbsp; and huck some rocks...&nbsp;&nbsp; and something flashes as the estuff they throw bounces off.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a force field.<br /><br />Asmodeus:&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know I would be wasting my time and yours if I sent my normal followers after you, so I have prepared something special."&nbsp; <br /><br />We spend a round buffing...&nbsp;&nbsp; We see a being a good 20ish feeet tall formed of a mass of limbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on a slew of tentacles that are pulling it across the floor.&nbsp; Each of the hands is carrying a sword.&nbsp; <br /><br />It's a hecatoncheireis.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed is in the crowd, but we don't yet see him.&nbsp; <br /><br />We see Ed as he releases chains through his body which hookshot through the field.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its as though there's no field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feels a strange resistance, but...&nbsp;&nbsp; gets through.&nbsp;&nbsp; He;s got a lot of chains around him, joins up with us.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha pulled out the undead of that person who had been antagonizing her for so long.&nbsp; She lets go a wraith.&nbsp; <br /><br />We also See Joe walk in.&nbsp; Asmodeus action that round.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's see how you fare against my pet!"&nbsp;&nbsp; and sits on her thrown with a ruby scepter and sits demurely and entertained.&nbsp; There's an orb encrusted in the throne.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />This thing has palpable telepathic waves... and it says "We will crush, destroy you, etc."&nbsp; It's Got telepathy 1000 ft and its going to use it, damn it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ann Says to joe that they were brought here for a purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; joe knows what he must do and releases that which we was holding.&nbsp; A Tarrasque...&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not Pseudonatural...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it looks changed dramatically though...&nbsp; it msut have been THAT one, but it doesn't look the same way.&nbsp; Strong winds emanate from his face and it like jumps out of him.&nbsp; He just manifeested.&nbsp; <br /><br />The telepathic waves just... stop...&nbsp; All of the hec torsos reorient.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus kina looks back and lookjs a little surprised and continues watching.&nbsp; Joe recognizes that he knew kiranselye from long ago when he sees Asmodeus.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone uses mislead to get a bit away... the hec has noticed it, but whether they consider it a threat....&nbsp;&nbsp; well, they don't take an attack of oppportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; like 98 of them are focused on the tarrasque.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus notices her, but she's more interested in the uber epic duel.&nbsp; <br />The crowd roars and they're very excited.&nbsp; Standing ovation just happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are pumped.&nbsp; There's no sense of feat that it might get out.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus is confident that her pet will tear through the tarrasque.&nbsp; Also, i shared smite with it.&nbsp; 63 misses.&nbsp; Actually 64 misses...&nbsp; It manages to just barely parry every thing.&nbsp; Like it -just- misses.&nbsp; <br /><br />The crowd is completely unaffected by the wail of the banshee that Admatha's minion does.&nbsp; The Tarrasque really te4ars into the creature... bite claw claw horn horn tail slap.&nbsp;&nbsp; THe hec clearly takes a shit ton of damage... some torsos are torn off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Those of us nearby feel the ground is unstable.&nbsp; 65 misses the thing.&nbsp; <br /><br />Do we get the action points?&nbsp;&nbsp; yes we do!&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus is paying attention to us but also to a swirling vortexz of ebnergy right in front of her...&nbsp; some kind of scrying sensor.&nbsp; Its a geomantic effect.&nbsp; Its something with a wide area probability change.&nbsp; She says into the sensor:&nbsp;&nbsp; "Idiot, leave the dragon alone, get the shapeshifters now!"&nbsp; <br /><br />The hec is not even winded.&nbsp; It swings 100 times and misses the tarrasque twice.&nbsp; Fake Simone is Skewered, but its there.&nbsp; The Tarrasque is looking not so good.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; The Tarrasque is winded but not yet wounded.&nbsp;&nbsp; It suffers heavy blow after heavy blow.&nbsp;&nbsp; It screams...&nbsp;&nbsp; its resisting them with regen, but its still damaging it. <br /><br />Ann Leaps out of Joe's mind... out of Joe's face into the tarrasque...&nbsp;&nbsp; the Tarrasque is even more badass...&nbsp;&nbsp; and has ghostly chains all around it. <br /><br />For ottos irrestitable will have to target a head.&nbsp; <br /><br />Vshir manages to stagger it.&nbsp; strikes teh dark matter essence in there.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha pulls out a body so she can revit the tarrasque.&nbsp; Her body cannot be used to revitalize.&nbsp; She uses her own... and hte damage doesn't trample.&nbsp; She revitalizes him for 180.&nbsp; The tarrasque is not longer winded.&nbsp; <br /><br />The tarrasque beats the shit out of the Heca and now the Heca is winded.&nbsp; <br /><br />Chunks of the tarrasques carapace have gone flying.&nbsp; 68 misses.&nbsp; 73 hits....&nbsp; its ac 69 or 70.&nbsp; 118 dmg ona&nbsp; crit, 5 more hits...&nbsp; <br /><br />It is able to partially resist each hit.&nbsp; Event hough Smites normally go through.&nbsp;&nbsp; It has stop putting up the level of resistance it has before...&nbsp;&nbsp; we're actually striking wounds...&nbsp;&nbsp; It is taking owunds.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus.&nbsp; She continues to look intrigued but is still mostly paying attention to the sensor... she's muttering something through it.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Heca summons another one.&nbsp; It just appoears as the heca glows with unholy energy to call it.&nbsp; <br /><br />Joe drains from the heca and donates to Ann.&nbsp; conduits between the summoned.&nbsp; 56 SR breached it.&nbsp; The fresh Heca has 5 Negative levels.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Tarrasque goes....&nbsp;&nbsp; it drops the one Heca.&nbsp; It is unconscious but not Dying.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tarrasque goes nuts on that fucker.&nbsp; Once its finished, it turns and looks at the other.&nbsp; It was looking for a way to eat the heca but its just too big. <br /><br />I give ed a move action and a standard action.&nbsp;&nbsp; He hookshots the orb.&nbsp; 71 attack roll...&nbsp; he knows he has to get it... so he sends a bunch... Asmodeus immediately responds, and deflects them so that they don't grab her, which was her thinking.&nbsp; But he gets the orb.&nbsp; Bam!&nbsp;&nbsp; Changes happen!&nbsp; But not here.&nbsp; <br /><br />The crowd roadred when the Heca went down.&nbsp; Also, there's a colelctive grasp when Asmodeus is 'attacked.<br /><br />Asmodeus looks totally shocked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scrying sensor is gone.&nbsp; <br /><br />Teleporting here doesn't work except for the merit point movement.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus goes.&nbsp; Asmodeus concentrates and draws a couple symbols in the air.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the spell, she's a 12 foot tall, wreathed in flames...&nbsp;&nbsp; She may have done something to alter the flow of time...&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereupon she looks at Ed, and he feels himself with great difficulty shake off the desire to become her servant and she nods and as a free action, teleports right next to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; and she's holding the rod...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She holds it behind her as though she's not going to fight him with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; the energies she's glowing with are those of the hell fist.&nbsp; <br /><br />The other one does not yet regain consciousness.&nbsp; The dark matter thats holding it together is pulling it back together, but it doesn't manage to just yet... the tarrasque fucked it up.<br /><br />And the other one attacks the tarrasque, hits 93 times, does 93 damage...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahh, debuffs at work.&nbsp; <br /><br />So now... Asmodeus is the big threat.&nbsp; Joe Takes another 6 neg levels.<br /><br /><br />Mephistopheles appears in the throne Asmodeus just vacated. and he says "I've been plotting this for thousands of years...&nbsp;&nbsp; if all I had to do was throw that rock down there I'd have done this a long time ago.&nbsp; <br />He turns into Hextor...&nbsp;&nbsp; its clear he was before.&nbsp; <br />He puts the field back up.<br /><br />"To you, Denizens of nessus, join with me now, or perish in flames<br />A lot of them get up and draw weapons... and then another bunch do.&nbsp; <br /><br />The stands erupt in chaos:&nbsp;&nbsp; Cries of "mephisto[pheles, the true king" and "My lord Asmodeus!"&nbsp; <br /><br />Yes, we're in an arena with Asmodeus and two hecatonchereis and and a legendary pseudonatural tarrasque...&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's safer in here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus seems annoyed, like that's an inconvencience.&nbsp; Asmodeus can and has beaten down mephistopheles before.&nbsp; <br /><br />Asmodeus is pissed, and there's that look of "Yes, what a surprise, he's taking advantage of the situation... Ass...&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll deal with him later."&nbsp;&nbsp; No sign of "I'm trapped in here."&nbsp;&nbsp; It's more of "That guy's an asshole and I'm going to kill him, a lot."<br />The heca ignores Vshir as he's&nbsp; <br /><br />70 hits Asmodeus.&nbsp; <br />Vshir carves into her a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; She wasn't staggered by Staggering crit.&nbsp;&nbsp; She starts deflecting some attacks with the ruby rod, which doesn't seem to be bothered with it.&nbsp; <br /><br />46 resists the will save that Asmodeus forced.&nbsp; <br /><br />dariel and Owl coup de grace the Heca...&nbsp;&nbsp; that smite is helping iwht the keeping it down.&nbsp; <br /><br />The Tarrasque turns to the other Heca...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but without the smite bonus, it is fairly ineffectual...&nbsp;&nbsp; it abosrbs almsot all fo the hit.&nbsp; like,... it does 5 damage.&nbsp; <br /><br />43 won't successfully dispel anything. <br /><br />Ed Makes his full attack...&nbsp;&nbsp; needed to make another will save, but passed.&nbsp; He felt like he shoudl be liking her boots, but then is like wait, I don't have a tongue, and full attacks.&nbsp; <br /><br />There is a very good chance that this is actually Asmodeus...&nbsp;&nbsp; not just an avatar... if we kill her...&nbsp; she's down...&nbsp; Avatars are a flow thing, and there's not flow here.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ed hits 9 times, with 2 crits, against asmodeus.&nbsp; Whubbada whubbuda whubbuda.&nbsp; 1026 damage.&nbsp; She is winded.&nbsp;&nbsp; And wounded.&nbsp; He takes a rod and casts it defensively.&nbsp;&nbsp; The effects:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 2 heca have their wounds go away badly.&nbsp; It is like mass heal..&nbsp; The downed one knits back together a lot but stays down.&nbsp; <br />She is encased in a field.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability is something that has been theorized is Asmodeus last resort.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reverie of Nessus<br /><br />She's in a field of force that cannot be breached.&nbsp;&nbsp; and 50 feet around it becomes antimagic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3 rounds to bring her back to perfect health...&nbsp;&nbsp; the most important facet of the rod:&nbsp;&nbsp; It gives you all the rest of spending a full night of sleep, usable 1/day.&nbsp; This begins round 1.&nbsp; Oh, and anyone who touches the rod who isn't her will die quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Inflict crit wounds every wounds.&nbsp; When Asmodeus went into the Shell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Heca suddenly jolted.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />We have a few choices:&nbsp;&nbsp; We can leave...&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe knows that there is an opening that leaves to the outside.&nbsp; The Barrier above shimmers but isn't removed, btu the cages are opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we do not finish the fight with Asmodeus...&nbsp; If we want to defeat Asmodeus, we've done that...&nbsp; Or we could stay and try and kill her.&nbsp; <br /><br />We can escape.&nbsp; <br /><br />We Players deliberate.<br /><br />We run...&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph leads us back out of the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guards of the Colliseum left&nbsp;&nbsp; Our flight through the city is rather unimpeded.&nbsp; Joseph is leading us back the way he came.&nbsp; <br /><br />We win in lunatic mode with no continues, but no extra stage for us...&nbsp;&nbsp; We make it back to the temple.&nbsp; That's where Joe and Ed came in.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're in the temple...&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed goes to the room.&nbsp; He's doing what Vance did.&nbsp; He doesn't have access.&nbsp; No nexuses here.&nbsp; The temple looks bacdly damaged... inside are defiled images of many of the gods.&nbsp; <br /><br />Ann doesn't know another way to return...&nbsp;&nbsp; but she senses that a way will become known to us.&nbsp; Ed goes down to where the globe is... there are no nexuses there.&nbsp;&nbsp; THe floor was all translucent, but now its more like a cave... the gluyph that was there is still there, but it looks kinda drained...&nbsp; <br /><br />The chains on Ed feel dormant.&nbsp;&nbsp; The orb is warm and pulsy.&nbsp; Ed takes the orb to the Bio shrine in the temple.&nbsp; Joe gets the idea that he was not supposed to have power over the temple... more the opposite.&nbsp; <br /><br />Admatha asks who bears the blood of a god.&nbsp; <br /><br />Simone and Dariel&nbsp;&nbsp; Try and fill the area with the essence...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and its being used... it forms an area of energy which is a portal out.&nbsp; A booming voice says "you should hurry."&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not a voice we know.&nbsp; We have never heard it.&nbsp; It's a male voice.&nbsp; We go through the mystery portal.&nbsp;&nbsp; we arrive in a cave...&nbsp;&nbsp; and we see the biggest dragon ever... we see bahamut...<br /><br />We bow respectfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bahamut says He'll be taking hte orb.&nbsp; We get the impression he's really fucking sick of not having the orbs.&nbsp; <br /><br />We are consolidated here.<br /><br />First, if we want to ask Bahamut stuff, we can.&nbsp; We're ion his personal layer... its a cacvern with crystalline structures in the wall.&nbsp; <br /><br />Bahamut takes the orb... and after a moment, some of us vanish (those of us who exist in the friday session.)&nbsp; <br /><br />We can ask bahamut questions ifLike, for instance, who the fuck is heironeus.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /></p>
