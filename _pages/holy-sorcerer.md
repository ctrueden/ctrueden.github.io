---

The holy sorcerer is a member of a society dedicated to protecting the innocent and preserving life. Holy sorcerers have the unique ability to cast both arcane and divine spells without preparation in advance, although their spell selection is extremely limited.

In many ways, a holy sorcerer is a "paladin of magic." Like a cleric, he serves his deity faithfully. In the case of the holy sorcerer, however, this deity must be good aligned. Each holy sorcerer is a member of a specific order, and each order of holy sorcerers is formed around a specific good deity.

**Base Attack Bonus:** Same as a cleric  
**Saving Throws:** Same as a cleric  
**Alignment:** Any good  
**Hit Die:** d8  
**Class Skills:** Same as a cleric  
**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Same as a cleric  
**Bonus Languages:** Celestial, Abyssal, Infernal and Draconic

### Abilities

Although the holy sorcerer studies both arcane and divine magic, it is impossible for him to split his studies exactly down the middle. Thus, he pursues one of two paths: the "divine" path or the "arcane" path.

A "divine" holy sorcerer has several clerical abilities. He chooses two of his deity's domains, and can cast those domain spells regardless of their spell schools (see "Spell schools" section). He also possesses the ability to turn undead as a cleric of the same level.

An "arcane" holy sorcerer has several wizard abilities. He begins with the "Scribe Scroll" feat and obtains a bonus metamagic feat at every fifth level. Each time he gains a level, he may add two new arcane spells to his spell book. Lastly, he may summon a familiar in the same manner as a wizard.

### Spells

Like sorcerers, holy sorcerers do not need to prepare their spells in advance. However, they do require a spell book for the arcane spells that they know. Like a wizard, the holy sorcerer must study his spell books for half an hour each day, or be unable to cast arcane spells. However, he need not memorize individual spells from the book, but rather look over his spells as a whole to keep them fresh in his mind. In addition, to cast arcane spells, a holy sorcerer requires the proper material components.

Holy sorcerers draw their power from a central pool of magic that is replenished each night as they sleep. A holy sorcerer's magic points are equal to twice his level plus his Wisdom modifier. A spell's cost in magic points is equal to its casting level.

#### Spell schools

A holy sorcerer can only cast spells from the spell schools with which he is familiar. He has access to a number of spell schools equal to the highest level of spells he can cast. The maximum number of spell schools he can know is also bound by his Wisdom modifier plus one.

Thus, a fifth level holy sorcerer with a Wisdom modifier of +4 knows three spell schools, since he can cast third level spells. However, if this holy sorcerer achieves eleventh level, he knows only five spell schools (even though he can cast sixth level spells), unless he can increase his Wisdom modifier to +5 or higher.

#### Spell types

The spell types available to holy sorcerers are Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Paladin and Wizard. To cast a spell of a given type, the holy sorcerer must mimic the casting style of that class. For example, to cast bard spells, a holy sorcerer must sing as a bard, and the usual restriction that bard spells cannot be cast silently applies.

A holy sorcerer can only cast spells of the types with which he is familiar. He has access to a number of spell types equal to the highest level of spells he can cast. The maximum number of spell types he can know is also bound by his Intelligence modifier plus one.

In addition, the holy sorcerer must meet the ability score requirements of each class whose spellcasting he mimics. For example, a holy sorcerer who wishes to cast a fourth level bard spell must have a Charisma of 14 or higher.

At first level, a "divine" holy sorcerer starts with the Cleric spell type, whereas an "arcane" holy sorcerer starts with the Wizard spell type. However, a first level holy sorcerer with an Intelligence bonus of at least +1 also starts with the other spell type (this is the one exception to the maximum number of spell types rule).

Thus, a first level "arcane" holy sorcerer starts with the Wizard spell type (as well as the Cleric spell type if his Intelligence modifier is +1 or better), and will learn a third spell type at fifth level. However, if a holy sorcerer with an Intelligence bonus of +3 achieves ninth level, he knows only four spell types (even though he can cast fifth level spells), unless he can increase his Intelligence modifier to +4 or higher.

### Ethos

A holy sorcerer must abide by a strict ethos. He must aid any non-evil intelligent creature whose life is being threatened. He also cannot kill any non-evil intelligent creature unless it directly threatens his life or the life of someone he is protecting. In the case of one non-evil intelligent creature trying to kill another, a non-lethal solution such as incapacitation is preferred—that is, killing should always be a last resort.

Should a holy sorcerer deviate from his ethos in any way, he is stripped of all abilities—including his ability to cast spells—and gains no experience until he atones for his mistake (see the _atonement_ spell).

In addition, like that of the paladin, the path of the holy sorcerer requires constant dedication. If a holy sorcerer gains a level in another class, he can never again gain another holy sorcerer level, although he retains all his holy sorcerer abilities.

## Holy Sorcerer's Energy Staff

Rare magical artifact

### Description

Just over five feet in height, the staff appears polished to a sharp black sheen, despite its age. The staff is straight, widening slightly from tip to knob, with a round cap at the top, in which the symbol of the holy sorcerers is engraved. Apart from the symbol, the staff is featureless but beautiful.

### Powers

The staff can be charged with holy sorcerer energy (spell points). Charges are not cumulative (that is, you must add the entire charge all at once). The wielder can charge a maximum of his caster level in spell points into the staff at one time, and charging it takes one minute of concentration. The staff functions as a +X magic weapon, based on the number of charges in the staff, as follows:

| # Charges |  X  |
|:---------:|:---:|
|   4 - 7   |  1  |
|   8 - 11  |  2  |
|  12 - 15  |  3  |
|  16 - 19  |  4  |
|    20+    |  5  |

Spell points can be drawn through the staff and into the wielder at a rate of one per round. Drawing a spell point from the staff is a standard action.

Lastly, the staff can release a magic missile at the cost of one charged spell point. Firing a magic missile from the staff is a standard action.
