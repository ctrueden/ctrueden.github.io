This is a basic example as to how you want your character sheet to look, but currently it doesn't have proper spacing.  Once I figure out how to put in open space between the categories it will look like the how the basic character sheet is supposed to look.  Each faction will have a slightly different format because their characters will be inherently different.  Players should look at their faction character sheet that shows a sample character (when it becomes available).  This will give you an even better idea as to what you should be doing when creating your character.
