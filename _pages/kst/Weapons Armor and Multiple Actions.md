ttSize categories for weapons and penalties:
Small: No Penalty, Knife, Dagger, Fist, Claw, Sling, Hatchet
Medium: -1 to O or D, Long Sword, Staff, Mace, Spear, Battle Axe, Bow, X-Bow
Large: -2 to O or D, Two-Hand Sword, Great Axe, Pike, Long Bow

tBase weapon damage by size and CRR:
Small: CRR 1 = 10 damage, CRR 2 = 12, 3 = 14, 4 = 16, 5 = 18, 6 = 20, 7 = 22, 8 = 24, 9 = 26, 10 = 28, 11 = 30, 12 = 32, 13 = 34, 14 = 36, 15 = 38, 16 = 40, 17 = 42, 18 = 44, 19 = 46, 20 = 48, etc.
Medium: CRR 1 = 11 damage, CRR 2 = 14, 3 = 17, 4 =20, 5 = 23, 6 = 26, 7 = 29, 8 = 32, 9 = 35, 10 = 38, 11 = 41, 12 = 44, 13 = 47, 14 = 50, 15 = 53, 16 = 56, 17 = 59, 18 = 62, 19 = 65, 20 = 68, etc.
Large: CRR 1 = 12 damage, CRR 2 = 16, 3 = 20, 4 = 24, 5 = 28, 6 = 32, 7 = 36, 8 = 40, 9 = 44, 10 = 48, 11 = 52, 12 = 56, 13 = 60, 14 = 64, 15 = 68, 16 = 72, 17 = 76, 18 = 80, 19 = 84, 20 = 88, etc.

Damage may be modified by other factors like DR.  Also, if the CRR is high enough, I will allow a player to have more say over how much damage she wants to do.

Larger things like Ballistae, Cannons, and other devices, will work differently.

tWeapon Specialization Groupings:
Blades-Knife, Dagger, Long Sword, Two-Hand Sword
Axes-Hatchet, Battle Axe, Great Axe, Throwing Axe
Clubs-Club, Hammer, Mace, War Hammer, Maul, Pick
Staves-Staff, Spear, Pike, Halberd
Hand/Body-Fist, Claw, Foot, Gauntlet, Brass Knuckles, Body Slam
Bows-Bow, X-Bow, Long Bow, Compound Bow
Guns-Pistol, Laser, Rifle
Throwing-Anything you throw, Sling, Bola, Grenade  (You can throw anything, but certain things are not meant to be thrown, so may be less effective.  Use your good sense when determining what will be effective when thrown)

There are other weapons that do not fall under any categories, whips for example.  In this case there is no point in specializing in a group for a single weapon, so you would need to specialize in the specific weapon.

tSpecialization in Specific Weapons or Groups of Weapons:
Each rank of a trait for weapon group specialization adds +1 O or D when the character uses a weapon in that group.  Example:  A character has 2 ranks in Clubs.  She gains +2 O, or +2 D, or +1 O and +1 D when she uses club-like weapons in combat.

Each rank of a trait for a specific weapon adds +1.5 O or +1.5 D (rounded down) when the character uses that weapon.  Example:  A character has 2 ranks in Club.  She gains +3 O, or +3 D, or +2 O and +1 D, or +1 O and +2 D when she uses a club in combat.  She does not gain any benefit if she uses any other club-like weapon.

Weapon Specializations (both group and specific) do not add CA.  However, if an enemy is using a weapon that a PC specializes in, they may gain better insight into what that enemy will do if it plans on using that weapon.

tArmor Bonuses and Penalties:

These are the basic bonuses for armor of each weight category.  Players will more often than not receive specialized armor that gives different resistances.  This is just to give you an idea of how different types of armor actually help you.

Unarmored: No Bonus. No Penalty.  Naked, Loin Cloth, Shirt &amp; Pants, Robe, Cloak
Light: +1 D, PR 1/10%, SR 2/20%, BR 2/20%, FR 1/10%, CR 1/10%.  Slight movement, mobility, and encumbrance penalties.  Leather, Hides, Thick Skin.
Moderate: +1 D, PR 2/20%, SR 3/30%, BR 3/30%, FR 2/20%, CR 1/10%.  Moderate movement, mobility, and encumbrance penalties.  Chain Mail, Ring Mail, Wood, Scales.
Heavy: +2 D, PR 4/40%, SR 4/40%, BR 4/40%, FR 3/30%, CR 2/20%.  Heavy movement, mobility, and encumbrance penalties.  Breast Plate, Full Plate Armor, Power Armor, Shell
Meklar: +2 D, PR 5/50%, SR 5/50%, BR 5/50%, FR 5/50%, CR 4/40%.  Heavy movement and mobility penalties, plus special Meklar penalties.

Small Shield: If trying to block: +2 D and -1 O.  Can use Two-Hand Ranged weapons.  Buckler, Small Shield, (1ft. diameter).
Medium Shield: +1 D. If trying to block: +3 D and -2 O. Cannot use Two-Hand Ranged weapons. Round shields (2 ft. diameter). Slightly reduced penalty to attacker for negative CRRs.
Large Shield: +2 D and -1 O. If trying to block: +4 D and -3 O. Cannot use Two-Hand Ranged weapons.  Some movement restrictions.  Kite shields, Round Shields (3 ft. diameter).  Moderately reduced penalty to attacker for negative CRRs.
Tower Shield: +3 D and -2 O. If trying to block: +5 D and -5 O.  Cannot use Two-Hand Ranged weapons.  Some movement restrictions.  Greatly reduced penalty to attacker for negative CRRs.

A character actively trying to block with a shield gains a bonus to D and a penalty to O.  A larger shield will give some bonuses to defense and penalties to attack inherently as well.  When a defender is blocking and the CRR is positive, then the attack will succeed and not hit the shield (unless the attacker is trying to hit the shield anyway).  If the defender is blocking and the CRR is 0 to -3, the attack will hit the shield.  At -4 or less, the attack misses.

When a shield blocks, the attacker essentially makes a new attack against it (as if she were making an attack against an object) to see if she damages it or possibly even breaks it.  The shield, like all objects, will have its own defense value, HP, and damage reduction.  If the attacker fails in her attack nothing happens to the shield.  If she succeeds, the shield takes HP damage.  If the shield's HP becomes 0 it is destroyed.  In the case of the shield taking damage or being destroyed, I will make a judgment call as to what additional events occur.  Sometimes I will have the defender take no damage, other times I will.  Again it depends on the situation and what I perceive to be most appropriate and/or entertaining.

When taking the % of the original damage, round up.  So 50% of 21 = 11.

Characters can attempt to attack areas of their targets which are unarmored or less armored.  There will be penalties to O based on the situation, but a successful strike will negate or lessen the resistance given by the armor.

Armor itself may be damaged or ruined.  This is especially likely in the cases of Fire damage for ignitable armors and Corrosive damage for nearly any armor.

Electricity will do more damage to characters in metallic armor, unless the armor is specially designed.

Damaging Spell Powers normally hit a player in its most armored location.  An extra rank can be spent to target specific parts.  This is useful for bypassing armor reduction, but may cause less damage overall anyway due to less ranks spent on damage.

tTaking Multiple Actions:

You are limited to 1 Power per turn.  Using powers takes time and concentration.  If you use a Power in conjunction with another action you must spend an additional rank to use the Power.

If you want to take multiple actions, you must choose to do so at the beginning of the round.  Though when making a single attack action and attaining a high enough CRR (5 base, but with additional modifiers depending on the situation), I may decide to allow you another free attack against the same target or a nearby target (again-depending on the situation).

Tripping, knocking down, pushing, disarming, targeting specific locations on an enemy, and other additional beneficial combat results are only possible when succeeding with higher CRRs.  Having multiple attacks will lower your damage as well as lessening the chance of having each of these added effects occur.  Think carefully beforehand whether it is worth making multiple attacks.

Each additional action will lower your CA by some amount, depending on what you do, for ALL actions you take.

Penalties:
-3 CA base, for each additional attack or other action

-0 CA if your weapon is small
-1 CA if your weapon is medium
-2 CA if your weapon is large

-0 CA if you have a small-sized shield in your off-hand
-1 CA if you have a medium-sized shield in your off-hand
-2 CA if you have a large-sized shield in your off-hand
-3 CA if you have a tower shield in your off-hand

-0 CA if lightly armored or unarmored
-1 CA if moderately armored
-2 CA if heavily armored or Meklar

+1 CA for a single weapon one-handed weapon

-0 CA for a two-hand weapon
+2 CA for dual-wielding attacks (attacking once with each weapon, 1 weapon in each hand), though count both weapons for additional penalties due to their size category

+2 CA for various martial arts attacks that make sense, one-two punches for example

-1 CA when multi-wielding for each additional weapon beyond the second, count each weapon for additional penalties

-0 CA for targeting the same person or thing
-1 CA for targeting another adjacent person or thing
-2 CA for targeting another distant person or thing
