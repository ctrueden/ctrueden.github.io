When someone asks if a particular effect is possible using the mystic
system, the answer is almost always a resounding "yes." The only
consideration is that powerful effects require a powerful mystic. It's
your responsibility to understand the system and to embrace player
creativityâ€”but make sure you are consistent in your rulings for how much
of which spheres different mystic effects cost.
