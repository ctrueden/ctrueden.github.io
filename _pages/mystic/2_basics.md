Instead of casting spells, a mystic performs magic by combining flows of
power from eleven different basic elements called spheres. For example,
a compulsive thief could be enchanted so that every time he steals
something, he suddenly feels a strong urge to confess to the crime, and
if he doesn't, he turns into a frog. Such an effect could be created by
combining Mind Control (for causing the urge to confess) with
Transmutation (for turning the thief into a frog) and Divination (for
determining when the thief has stolen, and when he hasn't confessed to
it).
