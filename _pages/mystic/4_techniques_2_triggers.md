Charging objects using the [Improved Mystic
Charge](/mystic/feats/improved-mystic-charge) feat and imparting objects
with magical charges using the [Imbue Mystic
Energy](/mystic/feats/imbue-mystic-energy) feat both allow the mystic to
release one or more charges mentally as a free action when desired. They
also allow the mystic to utilize a special form of Divination that
causes the charges to be automatically released when certain conditions
are met.

For a standard action trigger, add Div 1 at the time the charge is
imparted. For simple state triggers (e.g., "when I die," "when someone
puts on this coat," etc.) add Div 3. For free action triggers (e.g.,
thought), use Div 5. For interrupting triggers (e.g., "just before
someone touches the orb" or "when someone is about to pickpocket me"),
use Div 12.

For examples of use, see the [Improved Mystic
Charge](/mystic/feats/improved-mystic-charge) and [Imbue Mystic
Energy](/mystic/feats/imbue-mystic-energy) feats.
