There are many ways to incorporate mystic magic into a campaign. The
classes described here represent one straightforward way to integrate it
into a D&D campaign, but there are many other possibilities.

There are seven kinds of mystics, based on their arcane and divine
spellcaster counterparts. In most ways, they are equivalent to their
non-mystic versions, except that they use mystic magic instead of arcane
or divine spellcasting. That is, mystics use the same die type, base
attack bonus, saving throws, class skills (but see the
[Mysticraft](/mystic/techniques/mysticraft) section), skill point
progression, weapon and armor proficiencies (but see the [Mystics and
iron](/mystic/basics/iron) section), bonus feats (but see thee [Mystic
feats](/mystic/feats) section) and bonus languages as their respective
base classes. Information on special abilities and mystic sphere
progression for each class are detailed in the following sections.
