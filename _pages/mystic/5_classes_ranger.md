Mystic rangers usually utilize their mystic abilities to aid their
hunting and tracking activities, but they are not strangers to mystic
magic's versatility either.

Like the [ranger](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm), the mystic
ranger has access to ranger abilities at the appropriate levels,
including the automatic Track feat, favored enemies and the Improved
Two-Weapon Fighting option. Mystic rangers follow the [Half sphere point
progression](/mystic/points/types) beginning at 4th level with Wisdom as
their key ability, and can raise each sphere to a maximum of 10 ranks.
