Of all the mystics, the mystic sorcerer is the one who seeks truly great
destructive power. Their ability to harness the most primal mystic
essences effectively makes them a fearsome enemy to those who would
oppose them.

Like the
[sorcerer](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#sorcerer),
the mystic sorcerer can obtain a familiar. In addition, they receive an
improved progression in the [Pyrotechnics](/mystic/spheres/pyrotechnics)
sphere. Mystic sorcerers follow the [Normal sphere point
progression](/mystic/points/types) with Charisma as their key ability,
and can raise each sphere to a maximum of 20 ranks.
