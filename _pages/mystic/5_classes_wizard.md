Mystic wizards are the ones who crave maximum magical flexibility. Their
intense studies afford them additional magical stamina and a greater
number of specialized mystic techniques.

Like the
[wizard](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#wizard), the
mystic wizard can obtain a familiar, and earns one bonus mystic
metamagic or mystic item creation feat every five levels. Mystic
sorcerers follow the
[Normal sphere point progression](/mystic/points/types) with
Intelligence as their key ability, and earn two bonus reserve points per
level, and can raise each sphere to a maximum of 20 ranks.
