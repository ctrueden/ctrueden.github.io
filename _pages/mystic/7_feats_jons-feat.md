With Jon's feat, all spheres raise to 20 ranks automatically, regardless
of the mystic's level. This feat costs nothing to use, and is always
active. Also, Reserve raises to 100 ranks and will always refill itself
completely each round. In addition, wish-level magic costs no experience
to use. Only characters played by Jon can take this feat.
