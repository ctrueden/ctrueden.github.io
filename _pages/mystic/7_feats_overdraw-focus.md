**Prerequisite:** [Overdraw](/mystic/feats/overdraw)

Choose a sphere. When using the Overdraw feat to attempt a mystic effect
using that sphere, the chance of success improves, and effects four
levels above normal may be attempted (although it's risky). An effect
one level above normal succeeds 75% of the time (6-20 on a d20), two
levels above normal has a 45% chance (12-20 on a d20), three levels
above normal has a 20% chance (17-20 on a d20), and four levels above
normal has only a 5% chance of working (a natural 20 on a d20). In
addition, if an effect four levels higher than normal is attempted but
fails, the mystic is drained, losing all Reserve in his pool.
