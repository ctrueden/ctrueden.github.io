Whenever the mystic spends any extra sphere points to increase an
effect's duration, he receives a +2 duration bonus (that is, the first
duration point increases duration to 3d6, the second to 4d6, etc.). Note
that if no extra points are spent on duration, then the duration is
still one unit of time as normal.
