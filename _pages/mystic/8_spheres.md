The following sections give information about each sphere, including a
list of common effects. These lists should by no means make players feel
restricted in what they can do, but rather should serve as examples for
both players and dungeon masters regarding how much of which spheres
need be spent when magical phenomena take place.

The starting cost of each effect is given first, followed by a
description of the effect, followed by the effect's duration in
brackets. Later lines indicate how many additional points must be spent
to achieve different or more powerful results.
