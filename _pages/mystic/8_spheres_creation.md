Creation is the sphere for conceiving matter from nothing. With
Creation, a long sword could spring to hand from thin air, a stone wall
could surround an opponent, or a forest fire could be drenched with
gallons of water.

The cost of a basic Creation effect is governed by the volume of
substance created, by its value, by the complexity of its shape, and by
its corrosiveness (e.g., acid). To create a substance, the mystic must
be familiar with it. The mystic must have either studied a sample of it
within the past day, have a sample of it in his possession, or have
knowledge of how to craft it if it is complex.

For example, to create a sword when none is present, he must have at
least one rank in Craft (Weaponsmithing) and pass a Craft check (DC 15,
or DC 25 if masterwork). If an actual sword is present, the mystic can
create a sword without craft knowledge, but it cannot be of higher
quality than that of the model sword.

#### Create matter

1: Create up to 1 ft size (length + width + height) of harmless
substance in a simple shape, worth up to 1 cp. \[Permanent\]

For example, a small ball of iron could be created.

+1: +5 ft size (length + width + height)

+1: Double material value

For each point spent, the maximum value of the substance doubles. For
example, Leander the mystic wizard creates a gold piece (valued at 100
cp) with Creation 8 (maximum value 128 cp). Alternately, he could create
a diamond valued at 1,000 gp with Creation 18 (maximum value 217 cp =
131,072 cp = 1,310 gp).

##### Shape complexity (DM discretion—see table below for examples)

For each creature or creature's possession within the desired creation
area, add +2 to the effect's shape complexity, and each such creature
gets a Will save to negate the effect.
 

| Additional cost | Shape complexity description                                                               |
|:---------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|              +0 | Simple shapes (e.g., blocks, spheres, a simple quarterstaff)                               |
|              +1 | Simple items (e.g., a drinking glass, ammunition such as bolts and arrows, a sword sheath) |
|              +2 | Normal items (e.g., simple musical instruments, swords, many tools)                        |
|              +4 | Intricate or tricky items (e.g., an outfit, most musical instruments, a spyglass)          |
|              +8 | Masterwork items                                                                           |
|             +10 | Complex mechanical objects                                                                 |
|             +12 | Multicellular creatures                                                                    |

##### Damage

+1: +1d6 corrosion damage

Damage must be divided up to do a certain amount of damage each round.
Every round, at least one die of damage must be inflicted. For example,
Ellwood the mystic bard creates a flask of 7d6 acid using Creation 7.
Upon creating it, he decides the acid will deal 4d6 damage the round it
contacts a creature, 1d6 damage the following round, and finally 2d6
damage during the third round of contact.

+1: +1d6 damage due to temperature extremes

If the created object is very hot or very cold, it may deal an amount of
damage when touched. Less extreme temperatures, such as an object that
is pleasantly warm to the touch, do not cost extra. As time passes, the
object will heat up or cool down normally—that is, it is not magically
sustained at an unnatural temperature.

#### Optional rules

-   **Uncreation** – A mystic can, within the first hour after creation,
    "uncreate" the created object by touching it, regaining one half of
    the Creation points used to create the object.
-   **Temporary Creation** – Instead of created objects being permanent,
    they are temporary (minutes), and paying extra for increased value
    is not necessary. Such created objects have a certain essence to
    them that is unmistakable upon touch (so paying someone in magically
    created gold, for example, would probably not be a good idea).
    Created objects can be warded like any other temporary
    mystic effect.
-   **Soul Focus** – In conjunction with Temporary Creation, a new
    mystic feat—Soul Focus—allows for the mystic to spend 10 EP per
    point of Creation at the time the object is created to make the
    object permanent, eliminating its magical essence.
