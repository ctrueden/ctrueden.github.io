Destruction is the sphere for **eliminating matter and magic**. With
Destruction, objects can be destroyed, active magical effects can be
eliminated, and spells being cast can be countered.

#### Destroy matter

1: Destroy materials up to one foot in size. \[Instantaneous\]

If the object is magical, it will remove 1 level of enchantment from the
item. All magic must be disenchanted before the item itself can be
destroyed. If the destruction used to destroy the object exceeds the
level of enchantment, the item will be affected by any destruction that
was not needed to disenchant the item.  
+1: +5 foot size

#### Harm creature

1: Harm a living creature for 1d6 points of damage. \[Instantaneous\]

+1: +1d6 points of damage.

Notes:

-   The creature is entitled to a Will save for half damage.
-   Any living creature brought to -10 or below due to destruction magic
    is disintegrated, leaving no trace.
-   If this effect is used against negative-energy creatures, the damage
    done effectively heals the creature instead of harming it.

#### Dispel magic

2: Dispel a level 1 spell. \[Instantaneous\]

+2: +1 spell level.

#### Destroy warding

X: Reduce the effective warding level of a warded mystic effect by X.
\[Instantaneous\]

See the [Warding](/mystic/techniques/warding) section for more
information.

#### Counter mystic effect

1: Counter or dispel a mystic effect with sphere total 1.
\[Instantaneous\]

+1: +1 sphere total

See the [Countering mystic effects](/mystic/techniques/countering)
section for more information.

#### Anti-magic aura

14: Enchant an object or creature with an anti-magic aura. \[Temporary
(rounds)\]

This magical aura functions much like the *antimagic field* spell, but
only with regard to magic that affects the target object or creature.
