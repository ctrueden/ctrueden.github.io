Illusion is the sphere for projecting **false sensory experiences**.
With Illusion, almost any image can be created, any sensation can be
simulated, a mystic can make himself invisible to the senses of others,
and Pip can make almost anyone sigh.

(rounds)\]

+1: add an additional sense (sound, smell, taste) to the illusion
