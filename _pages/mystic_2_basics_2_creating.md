Like casting a spell, creating a mystic effect is a standard action, but
unlike spellcasting, using mystic magic does not incur an attack of
opportunity—nor are laborious memorization, incantation, hand gesturing
or material components required to create effects. The mystic simply
wills something to occur, and it is so.

A mystic pays for mystic effects by spending points from one or more
spheres in which he has sufficient ranks. For example, a mystic wizard
with at least three ranks in the Pyrotechnics sphere can generate a ball
of flame that deals 3d6 damage by paying 3 Pyrotechnics points
(abbreviated "Pyro 3"), or a mystic cleric with a rank in Healing could
heal 1d6 damage by paying 1 point of Healing ("Heal 1"). Ranks in a
sphere are acquired by buying them—see the [Sphere point
progression](/mystic/points) section for more information.

When creating an effect, the number of points spent from a given sphere
is called the sphere level for that sphere, and the sum all sphere
levels for an effect is referred to as the sphere total for that effect.
A single mystic effect's sphere total may not exceed the creator's
mystic level (the number of levels of his mystic class). Hence, a fifth
level mystic could create an effect using Div 2 + Enh 3, but not Pyro 6
or Mind 4 + Trans 2.
