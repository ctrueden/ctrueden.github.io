Many mystic effects call for a saving throw to resist their effects. The
DC of such a saving throw is ten plus the number of ranks the mystic has
in the effect's primary sphere (see the [Components of a mystic
effect](/mystic/components) section for more information about an
effect's primary sphere). For example, Lalu the mystic sorcerer has
eight ranks in Pyrotechnics. He throws a 1d6 fireball at an enemy using
Pyro 1 + Div 1. Since Pyrotechnics is the primary sphere of that effect,
the DC for the saving throw is 10 + 8 = 18.

Occasionally, a mystic effect may call for an ability check. The DC on
these checks is the same as the DC for saving throws versus mystic
effects, as detailed above.
