The Reserve sphere is a special sphere that allows the mystic to refill
points from other spheres that he has spent. As a free action, points
from Reserve may be transferred into any other sphere without penalty.
For example, if Trevin the mystic wizard has ten ranks in Destruction,
but he has used eight of it, he can spend up to eight Reserve points to
refill his Destruction.

Like spellcasters, mystics rejuvenate their power with a good night's
rest. Each morning, the mystic must spend half an hour in meditation,
preparing his mind for a day of harnessing raw magical energies. He
arises from this meditation with his Reserve completely replenished.
Note that the other spheres do not refill automaticallyâ€”the mystic must
accomplish that by drawing from his Reserve.
