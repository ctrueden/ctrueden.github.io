**Optional rule:** Ferrous metals have strange properties that inhibit
mystic energy. A mystic who wears any form of iron or steel becomes
unable to control the raw flows of power that otherwise come forth so
easily. Any iron object that forms an unbroken band around a portion of
the mystic's body causes this type of disturbance—including shirts,
pants, shoes, necklaces, helmets and headbands. Even rings and hoop
earrings make utilizing mystic magic impossible. Only very small items
such as stud earrings do not pose problems, since they do not encircle
any part of the mystic's body.

Note that arcane spell failure chance does not apply to mystics. There
is no such uncertainty with the mystic system—a mystic who is bound in
iron is totally unable to utilize his magical talent.
