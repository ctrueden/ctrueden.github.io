In general, a mystic effect has one or more [primary
spheres](/mystic/components/primary) that reflect the basic function of
the effect, one of three [duration](/mystic/components/duration) types
defining how long the effect lasts, one of two
[target](/mystic/components/target) types indicating who is affected by
the magic, and a [range](/mystic/components/range) detailing how far
