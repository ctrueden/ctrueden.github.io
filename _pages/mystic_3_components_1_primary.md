The sphere that represents the main focus of an effect is called the
primary sphere. For example, a ball of fire's primary sphere is
Pyrotechnics, whereas an effect that picks up a boulder and hurls it has
Kinetics as its primary sphere. Other spheres are often mixed in, but
the primary sphere will always be the one that represents the basic
function behind the effect.

As a rule, an effect has only one primary sphere. Magic complex enough
to require what might seem like multiple primary spheres takes longer,
and requires the [Mystic Charge](/mystic/feats/mystic-charge) feat to
pull off gracefully. Such combinations usually produce multiple effects
that occur in some specified order. For example, an effect that uses
Displacement to teleport a dagger behind an enemy and Kinetics to thrust
the dagger into his back could not be performed as a single action, but
the Displacement could be charged, then released the following round as
a free action immediately before a standard Kinetics effect.
