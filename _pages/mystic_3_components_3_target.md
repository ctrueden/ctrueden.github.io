Unless otherwise specified, mystic effects target a single object or
creature. However, most effects can be made to target an area by
spending extra points.

#### Converting a single-target effect to an area effect

A single-target effect can be converted into an area effect with 5-foot
radius by doubling the effect's primary sphere cost. For each five-foot
extension to the radius, add half the initial primary sphere cost,
rounded up. However, +10-foot radius is equal to the initial primary
sphere cost, not double the rounded up cost. Individual targets within
line-of-sight can be excluded from the effects by adding Div 1 per
target. An entire class of targets (e.g., "my friends") can be specified
or excluded with Div 5.

The [Efficient Burst](/mystic/feats/efficient-burst) feat improves a
mystic's ability to create area effects.
