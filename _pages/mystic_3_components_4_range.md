Initially, a mystic effect has a range of five feet from the mystic
(just within normal melee range). For each additional primary sphere
point spent, the range increases by one increment as follows:

| Points spent | Range in feet |
|:------------:|:-------------:|
| 0            | 5             |
| 1            | 25            |
| 2            | 50            |
| 3            | 100           |
| 4            | 200           |
| 5            | 300           |
| 6            | 400           |
| Etc. (+1)    | Etc. (+100)   |

The [Far Reach](/mystic/feats/far-reach) feat improves a mystic's range.
