Certain mystic techniques such as [warding](/mystic/techniques/warding)
and [item creation](/mystic/feats/itemcreation) require the mystic to
spend sphere points on a semi-permanent basis. Spending points in this
manner is called consuming them. When points are consumed, the sphere
rank temporarily drops when the points are spent. The sphere rank
returns to normal when certain conditions are met, depending on why the
points were consumed. Note that even when the sphere ranks return, the
spent points do not return until the mystic refills them using Reserve
as normal.

For example, Leander the mystic wizard wishes to create an anklet that
grants him an extra partial action each round. While creating the
anklet, he consumes Enh 6 (the cost of the haste effect). Normally, he
has nine ranks in Enhancement, but until the consumed points are
returned to him (when the item is completed), he effectively has only
three ranks. When he finishes the item, his ranks in Enhancement return
to nine, but he still has only three Enhancement sphere points
remaining, until he chooses to refill the sphere using Reserve.
