All mystics have access to an additional class skill called Mysticraft,
which is used for identifying mystic effects both as they are created
and after they are already in place. However, the Spellcraft skill is
cross-class for the mystic (as is Mysticraft for the non-mystic). The
DCs for identifying mystic effects are the same as [those for
Spellcraft](http://d20srd.org/srd/skills/spellcraft.htm), with mystic
effects counting as one half the sphere total (rounded down) in spell
level.

While Spellcraft and Mysticraft are quite different in many ways, they
are related skills. A character with five ranks in Mysticraft receives a
+2 synergy bonus to Spellcraft. Conversely, five ranks in Spellcraft
grants a +2 synergy bonus to Mysticraft.
