By readying an action, a mystic can counter a mystic effect as it is
being created (or a spell as it is being cast). To do so, the mystic
must first determine the exact sphere components of the effect with a
successful Mysticraft check (or in the case of a spell, a Spellcraft
check). The mystic may then counter the effect by spending an amount of
Destruction equal to the effect's mystic level (or for a spell, an
amount of Destruction equal to twice the spell level).
