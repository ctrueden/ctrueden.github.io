The mystic bard is a special breed, one that has decided to pursue a
mystical path to magic rather than a musical one. Arcane bards sometimes
view the mystic version of themselves with suspicion or even pity,
believing them to lack complete mastery over their music. Needless to
say, mystic bards feel differently about their musical talents.

Like the [bard](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm), the mystic bard
has both bardic knowledge and bardic music. Bardic knowledge works as
that of a regular bard. A mystic bard has access to bardic music
abilities at the appropriate levels: Countersong, Inspire Courage,
Fascinate, Inspire Competence, Suggestion and Inspire Greatness. Mystic
bards follow the [Half sphere point progression](/mystic/points/types)
with Charisma as their key ability, and can raise each sphere to a
maximum of 12 ranks.
