Although mystic clerics draw their power from mystic energies rather
than from the grace of their gods, their faith is just as strong as
their divine counterparts'. In fact, in the eyes of a mystic cleric,
mystic energy and divine energy are one and the same.

Like the [cleric](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/cleric.htm), the mystic
cleric has access to either Turn Undead or Rebuke Undead, depending on
alignment. In addition, mystic clerics receive an improved progression
in the [Healing](/mystic/spheres/healing) sphere. Instead of spontaneous
casting, mystic clerics can convert points in any sphere into
[Healing](/mystic/spheres/healing) sphere points for the purposes of
healing damage (treat the other spheres as Reserve for this purpose).
Mystic clerics follow the [Normal sphere point
progression](/mystic/points/types) with Wisdom as their key ability, and
can raise each sphere to a maximum of 20 ranks.
