Mystic druids are just as strongly tied to their natural surroundings as
their counterparts are, and their use of mystic magic is bound by a
similarly strict ethos. If a mystic druid abuses his abilities, he may
notice mystic energies turning on him, twisting his intended uses until
he takes action to correct his initial transgression.

Like the [druid](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm), the mystic
druid has access to druidic abilities at the appropriate levels,
including Nature Sense, Animal Companion, Woodland Stride, Trackless
Step, Resist Nature's Lure, Wild Shape, Venom Immunity, A Thousand Faces
and Timeless Body. Mystic druids follow the [Normal sphere point
progression](/mystic/points/types) with Wisdom as their key ability, and
can raise each sphere to a maximum of 18 ranks.
