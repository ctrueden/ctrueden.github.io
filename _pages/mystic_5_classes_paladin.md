Mystic paladins are every bit as honorable (and every bit as blustery)
as their divine counterparts, and they face the same harsh penalties for
misuse of their powers.

Like the [paladin](http://d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm), the
mystic paladin has access to paladin abilities at the appropriate
levels, including Detect Evil, Divine Grace, Lay on Hands, Divine
Health, Aura of Courage, Smite Evil, Remove Disease, Turn Undead and a
special mount. Mystic paladins follow the [Half sphere point
progression](/mystic/points/types) beginning at 4th level with Wisdom as
their key ability, and can raise each sphere to a maximum of 8 ranks.
