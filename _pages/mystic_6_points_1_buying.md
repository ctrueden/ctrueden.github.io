All mystic spheres start at zero ranks. Each level, a mystic has a
certain number of building points to spend buying sphere ranks, and
extra Reserve if desired. To increase a sphere's rank, add a number of
points equal to the next sphere level. For example, raising a sphere
from zero ranks to one rank costs one building point, whereas raising a
sphere from three ranks to four ranks costs four building points. No
sphere may have more ranks than the maximum allowed for that [mystic
class](/mystic/classes).

Increasing Reserve costs one building point per point of Reserve. There
is no limit on Reserve ranks. Also, any number of points may be saved
for later use, to be spent when the mystic achieves his next level.
