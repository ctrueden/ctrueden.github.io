When following the Normal sphere point progression, the mystic gains
building points equal to double his new level plus his key ability
modifier. For example, a [mystic wizard](/mystic/classes/wizard) with an
Intelligence of 17 who achieves fifth level receives 2 \* 5 + 3 = 13
additional building points to spend on sphere ranks and Reserve.

When following the Half sphere point progression, the mystic gains
building points equal to his new level plus half his key ability
modifier (rounded down). For example, a [mystic
bard](/mystic/classes/bard) with a Charisma of 21 who achieves ninth
level receives 9 + (5 / 2) = 9 + 2 = 11 additional building points to
spend on sphere ranks and Reserve. [Mystic
paladins](/mystic/classes/paladin) and [mystic
rangers](/mystic/classes/ranger) are treated as three levels lower for
the purposes of their mystic magic abilities. For example, a 7th level
[mystic ranger](/mystic/classes/ranger) is treated as a 4th level mystic
(with Half sphere point progression).

In addition, [mystic wizards](/mystic/classes/wizard) receive two bonus
Reserve points per level.
