Craft Mystic Item allows mystics to create magic items fueled by mystic
magic. If the desired effect is instantaneous, the item's effect can be
triggered a certain number of times per time period (see the table
below). For temporary effects, the item functions continuously (for the
one wearing or holding it, if applicable). To craft the item, you must
consume the mystic points as you create it (and the maximums are
returned to you when the item is complete). In addition, each point
spent for the object takes 1 hour, 200 gold, and a number of experience
points (see the table below).

| Type of effect          | EP cost per sphere point |
|:-----------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Temporary (rounds)      |                    1,000 |
| Temporary (minutes)     |                      100 |
| Temporary (hours)       |                       25 |
| Instantaneous, 1/round  |                    2,000 |
| Instantaneous, 1/minute |                    1,000 |
| Instantaneous, 1/hour   |                      500 |
| Instantaneous, 1/day    |                      250 |
| Instantaneous, 1/week   |                      100 |
| Instantaneous, 1/month  |                       25 |
| Instantaneous, 1/year   |                        5 |

For example, Trevin the mystic wizard wishes to improve his staff so
that it can shoot bolts of Destruction once per day. He decides to use
Destr 8 so that the bolts do 5d6 damage up to 100 feet away. Thus,
enchanting the staff takes Trevin 8 hours of work and costs him 1,600 gp
and 2,000 EP. The DC for any saving throws associated with the item is
as normal: 10 + Trevin's ranks in Destruction at the time the item was
created.
