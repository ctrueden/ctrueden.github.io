When converting a single-target effect to a five-foot area effect (see
the [Target](/mystic/basics/target) section), spend only half the usual
cost, rounded up. Increasing the area further thereafter costs the
normal amount (one half primary sphere level).

For example, Lalu the mystic sorcerer has the Efficient Burst feat and
wants to use a remote explosion Pyrotechnics effect on a group of
enemies. He decides the effect will do 5d6 damage (Pyro 3 for a mystic
sorcerer) and that he wants to encompass a 10-foot radius area 25 feet
away from himself. He pays Pyro 3 for the damage and an additional Pyro
1 for the 25-foot distance. Normally, converting this Pyro 4 effect to a
5-foot radius would thus cost an additional Pyro 4, but using Efficient
Burst the cost is only Pyro 2 (half the normal cost). Increasing the
radius from 5 feet to 10 feet costs half of the total sphere points used
in the original effectâ€”another 2 points. Thus, the total cost of the
effect is 8 (3 for damage, 1 for range, (3 + 1) / 2 = 2 for the first
5-foot burst, and (3 + 1) / 2 = 2 more to increase the burst radius to
10 feet).
