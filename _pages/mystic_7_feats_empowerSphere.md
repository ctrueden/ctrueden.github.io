Choose a sphere. All dice for effects with that sphere as the primary
one use d8s instead of d6s. This feat may be taken more than once, but a
different sphere must be chosen each time.

For example, Anna the mystic sorcerer has seven ranks in Pyrotechnics
and has the Empower Sphere (Pyrotechnics) feat. Hurling a blast of
icy-cold death at an orc twenty feet away, she spends Pyro 1 for range,
and Pyro 6 to deal 11d8 of chilly damage, turning the orc into a large
cube of orcsicle for the low, low price of Pyro 7. Yum yum!
