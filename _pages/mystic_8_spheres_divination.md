Divination is the sphere for **revealing the unknown**. With Divination,
the mystic can gain perceptive abilities, acquire knowledge or identify
when trigger conditions occur.

There are three types of Divination: **perception** effects, **truth
sensing** effects, and **knowledge acquisition** effects. The first two
types of Divination can be done relatively painlessly, but knowledge
acquisition is usually more costly. For truth sensing effects, the
mystic's eyes gleam with sparks of purple energy as the sensing occurs.
For perception effects, the target's eyes gleam in such a manner for the
duration of the effect. Anyone who knows what to look for should be able
to easily identify a creature affected by such Divination magic.

#### Perception effects

Perception effects are those that grant some form of added understanding
of the outside world. For example, a spellcaster affected by the detect
magic spell has an added understanding of magical auras.

1: Grant a creature a perceptive ability (for "nearby" abilities, 5 ft
range) of difficulty level 1. \[Temporary (minutes)\]

+1: +1 difficulty level, according to the following table

+1: +1 range increment (for "nearby" abilities, see
[Range](/mystic/components/range))

Note: Unwilling creatures are entitled to a Will save to resist the
effects.

| Difficulty level | Perceptive ability to be gained                                                          |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  1               | Detect nearby magical auras (similar to the Detect Magic spell)                          |
|  4               | Understand a foreign language in spoken form<br>(+2 Enh to also be able to speak it)     |
|  5               | Understand a foreign language in written form<br>(+3 Enh to also be able to write it)    |
|  5               | Detect emotions of nearby creatures                                                      |
|  6               | Detect thoughts of nearby creatures (similar to the *detect thoughts* spell)             |
|  6               | Scry someone who is scrying you (on successful Scry check)                               |
|  6               | Detect intentions of nearby creatures toward other creatures                             |
|  8               | Detect locations of nearby invisible creatures (similar to the *see invisibility* spell) |
|  8               | Detect lies from nearby creatures (similar to the *discern lies* spell)                  |
| 10               | Scry an area (similar to the *scrying* spell)                                            |
| 15               | See nearby things as they truly are (similar to the *true seeing* spell)                 |

3: Target creature gains a +1 insight bonus to hit.
\[Temporary (rounds)\]

+3: +1 insight bonus

#### Truth sensing effects

Truth sensing effects are those that grant the mystic some sort of
intuitive knowledge about the situation at hand. For example, when
interrogating a prisoner, using Divination to sense whether the last
statement made was a lie would qualify as a truth sensing effect.

1: Sense a truth of difficulty level 1. \[Instantaneous\]

+1: +1 difficulty level, according to the following table

Note: A truth sensed regarding an unwilling creature entitles that
creature to a Will save to conceal the truth.

| Difficulty level | Truth to be sensed                                 |
|:----------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| 2                | General alignment near the mystic                  |
| 3                | Common name of a creature near the mystic          |
| 4                | Presence of an object near the mystic              |
| 4                | Level of magic—sphere total or spell level         |
| 4                | General intelligence of a creature near the mystic |
| 5                | Alignment of a creature                            |
| 6                | Specific lie just told                             |

#### Knowledge acquisition effects

Some types of information are harder to obtain than others. A mystic can
obtain knowledge not directly relevant to his immediate situation, but
it is costly. To use a knowledge acquisition effect, it costs 10 EP per
point of Divination spent in this way.

1: Acquire knowledge of difficulty level 1. \[Instantaneous\]

+1: +1 difficulty level, according to the following table

+2: one additional constraint (if applicable)

+4: exclude general constraint from a divination effect.

+6: learn exact information instead of general information (if
applicable)
 

| Difficulty level | Knowledge to be learned                                                                    |

|  1               | Whether something exists (no constraints)                                                  |
|  2               | Very general use of an item (no constraints)                                               |
|  3               | General location of the nearest object or creature relative to the mystic (no constraints) |

|  4               | General use of a magic item (no constraints)                                               |
|  5               | Yes-or-no answer to a simple question ("unknown" is also a possible answer)                |

| 10               | Exact location of a specific object or person                                              |
