Enhancement is the sphere for **increasing qualities already present**.
With this sphere, creatures can become bigger and stronger, objects can
spring to life, and mystics can link with each other to combine their
powers.

Notes:

-   For any of the following Enhancement effects, an unwilling target is
    entitled to a Will save.
-   All bonuses and penalties from Enhancement effects are considered
    enhancement bonuses, and thus do not stack with each other (even
    when using wish-level magic).

#### Enhance quality

by growth level 1. \[Temporary (minutes)\]

modifiers.

Constitution score or Wisdom score, but it does possess a basic Charisma
score based on the intrinsic beauty of the object being animated.
