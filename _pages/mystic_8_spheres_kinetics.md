Kinetics is the sphere for **moving things with magical force**. With
Kinetics, any material—including living creatures—can be moved steadily,
forced to remain motionless or suddenly hurled at high velocity.

#### Move steadily

1: Steady movement. \[Temporary (rounds)\]

Move up to 25 lbs. of material at 10 feet per round.

+1: +25 lbs.

+1: +10 ft/round

#### Move suddenly

1: Sudden thrust of motion. \[Instantaneous\]

Move up to 10 lbs. of material at great speed in a direction chosen by
the mystic, dealing 1d6 of damage to anything struck with the material.
Treat the item as though it has a range increment of ten feet (for every
ten feet it travels, it has a cumulative +2 to hit). DM discretion
applies with certain materials—for example, a properly aligned arrow
might instead have a thirty-foot range increment and do 1d8 damage.

+1: +10 lbs.

+1: +1d6 damage

#### Hold motionless

1: Hold up to 25 lbs. of material motionless. \[Temporary (rounds)\]

+1: +25 lbs.

#### Manipulate with force

1: Touch or manipulate an object with up to 5 lbs. of force. \[Temporary
(rounds)\]

+1: +10 lbs. of force

Notes:

-   Each creature being directly affected is entitled a Will save to
    avoid the effects each round, and may attempt to make a Strength
    check to resist the effects for that round.
-   The mystic must concentrate (a move-equivalent action) to change the
    speed or direction of a controlled object.
-   Kinetics on objects or persons can be warded normally. To change the
    position of a warded object, the mystic must concentrate on the
    warded effect. Creatures affected by Kinetics may move normally
    unless the mystic is concentrating on the effect.

#### Generate sonic energy

1: Deal 1d6 sonic damage. \[Instantaneous\]

+1: +1d6 damage

#### Increase movement speed

1: Increase movement rate by +5 ft. \[Temporary (rounds)\]

+1: +5 ft movement rate

Kin 2 + Div 2: Target weapon gains a +1 homing bonus to hit. \[Temporary
(rounds)\]

+2 Kin, +2 Div: +1 homing bonus
