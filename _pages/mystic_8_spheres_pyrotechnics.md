Pyrotechnics is the sphere for **wielding pure magical energy**. With
Pyrotechnics, a powerful elemental attack can be unleashed, and a dark
cavern can be made brightly illuminated.

#### Elemental types

All Pyrotechnic effects are formed from one of four different
elements—fire, ice, electricity, or force—each of which has its own
unique properties. Fire causes fire damage and can set objects aflame.
Ice causes cold damage and can even freeze objects solid. Electricity
causes shock damage and can stun enemies. Force is relentless in its
ability to damage practically any form of material.

#### Attack styles

There are four ways to form a Pyrotechnic attack: touch, ray, ball and
remote explosion. To use ray, ball or remote explosion, extra
Pyrotechnics must be mixed into the effect to extend the reach (see the
Range section). All forms of Pyrotechnic attack entitle each victim to a
Fortitude save for half damage.

-   **Touch** – A touch attack simply transfers the Pyrotechnic power
    from the mystic to the enemy's body. The mystic must hit the enemy
    with a successful touch attack.
-   **Ray** – A ray attack emits a ray from the mystic that damages an
    enemy upon contact. The mystic must hit the enemy with a ranged
    touch attack, unless Div 1 is mixed into the effect.
-   **Ball** – A ball attack fires a ball of Pyrotechnic energy from the
    mystic toward an enemy or group of enemies. The ball is often
    targeted in a particular direction, in which case all creatures
    within the ball's path are entitled to a Reflex save to dodge the
    attack and take no damage. Alternatively, the mystic can mix Div 1
    into the effect to target the ball at a particular enemy, denying
    that enemy its Reflex save (although other creatures in the ball's
    path each still get one).
-   **Remote explosion** – A remote explosion attack causes a burst of
    Pyrotechnic energy to explode at a distance from the mystic. All
    creatures caught within the explosion are affected.

Note: Use the rules for area-effects listed in the
[Target](/mystic/components/target) section for the "ball" and "remote
explosion" effects.
