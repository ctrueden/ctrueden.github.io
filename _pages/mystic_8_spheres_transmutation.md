Transmutation is the sphere for **transforming the essence of a thing**.
With Transmutation, any material, whether living or not, can be
converted into any other substance. Transmutation can also be used to
change the physical state of the material (liquid, solid, or gas), its
corrosiveness or its temperature.

#### Transmute matter

1: Transmute up to 1 ft size (length + width + height) object into
something of the same size, shape and value. \[Permanent\]

For example, a small iron block could be transmuted into a small block
of cheese.

+1: +5 ft original size (length + width + height)

This value applies to how large the original object is.

+1: +5 ft size (length + width + height)

This value applies to how much larger or smaller the transmuted object
is than the original one. For example, transmuting a huge block of iron
into a tiny iron ball would cost extra Transmutation points.

+1: Double material value (see [Creation](/mystic/spheres/creation) for
details)

This value applies to how much more valuable the transmuted object is
than the original one. Note that transmuting a valuable object into
something worthless does not cost extra.

+1: Increase shape complexity (DM discretion)

This value applies to how much more complex the transmuted object is
than the original one. See [Creation](/mystic/spheres/creation) for a
list of various objects' shape complexities.

+1: +1d6 corrosion damage (see [Creation](/mystic/spheres/creation) for
details)

This value applies to how much more or less corrosive the transmuted
object is than the original one. For example, transmuting 2d6 acid to
harmless water would cost 2 extra Transmutation points, as would
transmuting harmless water into 2d6 acid.

+1: +1 damage due to temperature extremes (see
[Creation](/mystic/spheres/creation) for details)

This number applies to how much more or less damaging the transmuted
object is than the original one. For example, transmuting a red-hot
poker into the same poker at room temperature would cost extra
Transmutation points.

+7: Alter the physical state of the material from liquid to gas, solid
to liquid or gas to liquid.

+12: Alter the physical state of the material from solid to gas or from
gas to solid.

Notes:

-   Transmutation involving living things is possible, but the effect is
    temporary (minutes) rather than permanent. In addition, the cost of
    the effect is doubled if any target is a living thing. Unwilling
    living creatures receive a Will save to avoid the effects. In
    addition, the creature's stats do not change regardless of the
    new form.
-   Transmuting a living thing into a non-living form is also possible,
    but increases the cost by +8. The creature is effectively put into
    stasis until the effect wears off.
-   Attempting to transmute an item currently in an unwilling creature's
    possession allows the creature to make a Will save to prevent that
    item's transformation.
-   Complex transmutations, such as turn a block of stone into a clock,
    require the mystic to have knowledge of the transmuted form as
    though he were going to create the object using Creation. For more
    details on what a mystic must do to be familiar with a complex
    object, see the Creation section.

#### Optional rules

-   **Convertibility** – When transmuting something valuable into
    something of less value, those extra "value points" can be converted
    into other attributes at a one-half ratio (rounded down). For
    example, a diamond worth 1000 gp takes Creat 18 to make, Creat 17 of
    which is spent toward value. Thus, up to Trans 8 can be extracted
    from the diamond, converted from its value into other attributes
    such as size. With this technique, such a 1000 gp diamond could
    therefore be transmuted into a boulder of size 40 for a cost of only
    Trans 1!
-   **Temporary Transmutation** – Instead of transmutation being
    permanent, it is temporary (minutes), and paying extra for increased
    value is not necessary. Such transmuted objects have a certain
    essence to them that is unmistakable upon touch (so paying someone
    in magically transmuted gold, for example, would probably not be a
    good idea). Transmuted objects can be warded like any other
    temporary mystic effect.
-   **Soul Focus** – In conjunction with Temporary Transmutation, a new
    mystic feat "Soul Focus" allows for the mystic to spend 10 XP per
    point of Transmutation at the time the object is transmuted to make
    the transmutation permanent, eliminating its magical essence.
