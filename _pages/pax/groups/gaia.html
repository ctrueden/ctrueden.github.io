<p>
  This organization, led by a pixie named
  <a href="../npcs/nyx">Everlily Nyx</a>, represents the interests of the
  living earth, whom they call "<a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a>." Although
  they seem to be genuinely concerned about the future of the planet, their
  hatred of <a href="../races/humans">humans</a> coupled with their "ends
  justify the means" attitude thus far have portrayed them in a poor light.
</p>

<p>
  At least one member, a siren named
  <a href="../npcs/marissa">Marissa</a>, has implied that
  <a href="../npcs/nyx">Nyx</a> is the one driving the group to such
  drastic action, and that many among them disagree with her methods.
