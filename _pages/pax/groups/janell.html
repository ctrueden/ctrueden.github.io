<p>
  This group, led by <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara Cassenti</a>, is widely
  referred to as a cult, although it does not share many of the more dangerous
  qualities of some other unorthodox (or even orthodox) religions. The
  organization started small, but a certain charm has since drawn over two
  hundred members into its ranks, equally men and women of many backgrounds.
</p>

<p>
  The Way of Janell espouses openness and tolerance, claiming their religion is
  just one way, but not the only way. Their most fundamental and radical belief
  is that <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> is touched by a goddess called
  <a href="../npcs/janell">Janell</a>, who speaks through
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara's</a> body to make her teachings known.
</p>

<p>
  The "Janellers" have purchased a plot of land within Pax Artificium that they
  have dubbed "the Garden." It is the largest privately owned park (i.e.,
  outdoor area open to the public) in the city. The Way of Janell often hosts
  special events at the Garden, providing meals to the poor while spreading its
  teachings.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> is ably assisted by her protege,
  <a href="../npcs/ralph">Ralph Gutenberg</a>, who speaks for the group
  when <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> is otherwise unavailable.
  Other members include <a href="../npcs/donald">Donald Samson</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/philip">Philip Hindendorf</a>, who were perfectly
  normal cult members until they tried to assassinate
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel Miller</a>, supposedly under orders from
  <a href="../npcs/janell">Janell</a> herself. They failed in this goal,
  have faced trial and are now serving fifteen years in Pax Artificium
  Penitentiary.
