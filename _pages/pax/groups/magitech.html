<p>
  Magitech Corporation ("proto-Magitech") was formed in the early 2010s when a
  scientist, <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Dana Arthur</a>, and her husband, a
  mystic named <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Fox Arthur</a>, started to
  experiment with embedding a human consciousness into a machine. After years
  of research, they managed to implant the mind of their son,
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid Arthur</a>, into a computer core.
  Unfortunately, <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Dana</a> disappeared (and was
  presumed dead) as a result of the procedure, and
  <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Fox</a>, overcome with grief, left the country
  to wander the east.
</p>

<p>
  From the ashes of the fallen company, <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a>
  rebuilt as he grew older, redirecting Magitech toward his own research in
  architecture and engineering. Through hard work and perseverence,
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a> quickly built Magitech into a company with
  a reputation for quality ("neo-Magitech"). In 2020, it won
  <a href="../rules/politics">the bid</a> to manage the infrastructure of
  major U.S. cities&mdash;roads, public transportation, sewer systems, etc.
</p>

<p>
  But <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a> true dream was to build a whole new
  city from the ground up. In 2030, with the help of
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a> mystical talents, Magitech designed and
  built a unique city: Pax Artificium.
</p>

<p>
  Even though <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a> has since passed on, he has
  left a great legacy. His company is currently a major force in the U.S., and
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a> one-time assistant, has deftly taken
  over the company's reigns after being imbued with mystical abilities himself.
  Other fine staff include <a href="../npcs/leo.html">General Leo</a> managing
  Pax Artificium's defenses and other military matters,
  <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Zuul</a> maintaining the city's functions and
  designing new technological defenses,
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam Connor</a> in charge of Magitech's lunar
  project, and many other competent personnel handling more mundane matters of
  infrastructure in other U.S. cities.
