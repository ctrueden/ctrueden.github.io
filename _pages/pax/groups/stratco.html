<p>
  Strategic Improvements Corporation&mdash;often called "StratCo"&mdash;was
  formed in the early 21st century by two men,
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Ingolf Rixmann</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Having discovered a new process for enhancing the physical capabilities of
  human soldiers, they began to generate government interest in their
  techniques, selling them to the highest bidder. When the U.S. government
  <a href="../rules/politics">began outsourcing many of its functions in
  2020</a>, StratCo won the bid to manage much of the United States military.
  (Some conspiracy theorists believe that StratCo was partially responsible for
  this privatization, although there is little hard evidence supporting this
  claim.) As a result, although StratCo was founded in Germany and its world
  headquarters is located there, the company has many branches located in the
  United States as well.
</p>

<p>
  Six months ago, StratCo split into two factions when
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a>, the head of R&D, attempted a
  corporate takeover against <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> took StratCo headquarters with
  military force, and <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> was forced to
  flee when he was unable to deal with the forces aligned against him.
  (Although it is not public knowledge, those familiar with these events know
  that <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> had formed an alliance with
  <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a> and the
  <a href="../npcs/janus.html">Rex wraith</a>. When
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> summoned a gold dragon to aid him
  against <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann's</a> troops, the
  <a href="../npcs/janus.html">Rex wraith</a> somehow transformed it into a
  dracolich, which then attacked <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, who
  only managed to escape thanks to his new bodyguard,
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack Daniels</a>.)
</p>

<p>
  After the infamous showdown between
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a>, <a href="../npcs/sitruc.html">Sitruc</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/anna.html">Anna</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> and the combined PCs outside Pax
  Artificium, <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> escaped, and StratCo
  lay in ruins. <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> began to take legal
  action against <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> to regain his
  company, and a trial date was scheduled for early January. Several PCs were
  asked to testify. But in late December,
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> told the witnesses that the trial
  had been canceled, and that he had reached a settlement out of court with
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> wherein
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> would retain control of the
  company. At the same time, he dismissed <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>,
  his only remaining his faithful bodyguard (his other two,
  <a href="../npcs/castor.html">Castor</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/pollux.html">Pollux</a>, had disappeared six months ago
  during the turmoil).
