  When the Wednesday group first stole the Magitech computer core at the behest
  of the CIA (as per <a href="noj">Noj's</a> instructions), this
  mysterious woman appeared to steal it from the party (as per
  <a href="sitruc">Sitruc's</a> instructions). She brought it to Russia to
  be studied, but <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> had difficulty deciphering
  its secrets. Anna also kidnapped <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> so that
  <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> could probe his mind for information, but
  the strategy proved futile.
</p>

<p>
  When <a href="banks">Agent Banks</a> and
  <a href="janus">James Rex</a> (possessing the body of
  <a href="summers">Agent Summers</a>) showed up to recover the core from
  both Russia and the Saturday group, it became clear that Anna and
  <a href="janus">Rex</a> both possessed powerful psionic abilities, which
  they immediately proceeded to use against one another.
</p>

<p>
  Later, on the mysterious island in the Bermuda Triangle,
  <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> and Anna appeared to stop the combined party
  from performing <a href="janus">Rex's</a> ritual to destroy the obelisk.
  Anna was incapacitated (<a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> went so far as to
  cut Anna's spinal cord to paralyze her), but she healed herself somehow.
  Once <a href="noj">Noj</a> bound <a href="janus">James Rex</a> to
  his will, Anna escaped through a portal, taking the Saturday group with her
  to a secret Himalayan hideaway she shared with
  <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a>.
</p>

<p>
  While the Saturday group was working with <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a>,
  they discovered that <a href="lefty">Lefty</a> may be Anna's daughter
  (at least, <a href="lefty">Lefty</a> referred to her as
  &quot;Mom&quot;).
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, <a href="noj">Noj</a> and <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a>
  concluded the latest iteration of their eternal game, and it was time to
  &quot;clear the board&quot; and start again. <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a>
  betrayed Anna, infecting her with a vile black substance that can only be
  described as &quot;essence of
  <a href="../races/elves">wraith</a>.&quot; Since
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> was able to use his temporal abilities to
  partially reverse the damage, and <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> then
  healed her, Anna survived this attack. The scars remain, however, as her
  entire body remains covered in faint, black etchings (not to mention the
  depth of the psychological damage inflicted).
</p>

<p>
  After the fight, she rested at <a href="cid">Cid's</a> mansion for
  several weeks. Once she regained consciousness, she disappeared, not to be
  seen for several months.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> have since encountered her, when she
  first tried to recruit <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> to assist her
  in abducting <a href="bishop">John Bishop</a>, and subsequently invited
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> to join with her and
  <a href="josef">his evil twin</a> in some sinister organization, on the
  condition that he murder <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara's</a> unborn twins.
</p>

<p>
  When <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> refused, Anna and a plague zombie
  <a href="bishop">John Bishop</a> tried to kill him, but he narrowly
  escaped, with the help of some construction workers who mysteriously came to
  his aid (in the predawn hours of the morning)...
