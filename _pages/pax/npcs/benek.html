  Benek was once a roguish <a href="../races/elves">elf</a>, never able to
  keep a steady job. Like many of his people, he had a passion for growing
  things, but no one among his brethren particularly required a gardener.
  However, he did not wish to leave his best friend
  <a href="sartus">Sartus</a>, nor many of the lovely young women with
  whom he had become quite close. But now, like most of his people, his body is
  long dead, and his spirit has been fused with the body of a deceased
  <a href="../races/humans">human</a>, yielding a wraith.
</p>

<p>
  Though Benek and <a href="sartus">Sartus</a> served their king,
  <a href="janus">Janus Ilaris</a>, faithfully, they grew increasingly
  concerned when it became clear that <a href="janus">Janus's</a> sole
  purpose for their people was to exact revenge upon the
  <a href="../races/humans">human</a> descendants of the ones responsible
  for their people's demise.
</p>

<p>
  When <a href="janus">Janus</a> himself became bound in wraith form and
  was no longer his own master, Benek and <a href="sartus">Sartus</a> were
  uncertain what to do next. But once they learned that their people had been
  miraculously born anew within the barren womb of
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara Cassenti</a>, they realized a better, more
  harmonious route lay ahead. Even if their spirits are twisted beyond
  redemption, Benek and <a href="sartus">Sartus</a> have vowed to do
  whatever is necessary to protect <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara's</a> twins,
  to ensure the rebirth and survival of their once-proud race.
