<p>
  Dr. Cid Arthur was the CEO of
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech Corporation</a>, and indeed the
  general populace still believes him to be. In actuality, he has been
  succeeded by his assistant <a href="../pcs/pete">William Moss</a> after
  his untimely death at the hands of the
  <a href="healer">Great Healer</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Cid was the driving force behind the conception and construction of Pax
  Artificium. Unbeknownst to ordinary people, much of the city's technology has
  been augmented by magic. As one of the most powerful mystics on the planet,
  Cid used his abilities to construct a city that symbolizes peace forged
  through technology.
</p>

<p>
  When Cid was thirteen years old, his parents had just formed
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> [GM's note: for historical
  purposes, I refer to this period in
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech's</a> life as the
  &quot;proto-Magitech&quot; era]. They performed many experiments, attempting
  to immortalize human existence by fusing it with a machine. Their first
  twelve test subjects are better known as the
  <a href="../groups/zodiac">Zodiac computers</a>. Although these tests
  were mostly successful, it was discovered that although their personalities
  had been largely retained, most of the subjects' memories had been lost in
  the transfers, a side effect deemed unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
  Cid was lucky number thirteen, and his case was a bit more ambitious. The
  structure within which they housed his soul&mdash;a sphere which would later
  become the Pax Artificium computer core&mdash;was somewhat larger than the
  <a href="../groups/zodiac">Zodiacs</a>. The process involved the
  scientific research of Cid's mother <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a>,
  coupled with the magical abilities of Cid's father
  <a href="healer">Fox</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, magic always has its price. The procedure was successful, but
  the mystical backlash caused <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a> to
  disappear in the process. Crushed from the loss of his wife,
  <a href="healer">Fox</a> left proto-Magitech and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
  Cid found that he could project an image of himself within the laboratory
  where the procedure was performed, since his parents had had special
  technology put in place there. As Cid grew older, he began his own research.
</p>

<p>
  Years passed. Ultimately, Cid arranged for the construction of Pax
  Artificium, designing it so that he would have free reign throughout the
  city. To make public appearances elsewhere, his trusted assistant
  <a href="../pcs/pete">William Moss</a>, being a doppleganger, would take
  his form and represent <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech's</a>
  interests as needed.
</p>

<p>
  Cid believed his mother to be dead for many years, but recently learned that
  rather than being destroyed in the ritual that created him, she was shunted
  into the cyber world as well, living for many years as a "ghost in the
  machine." Instinctually, she finally found somewhere to settle when she
  discovered a teenage boy named <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam Smitts</a>, who
  had recently had a neural network installed in his head to augment his brain
  functions (to prevent degeneration due to a disease similar to early onset
  Alzheimers). Consequently, her consciousness superceded the boy's own, and a
  new personage was born. Though she at first had no memory of her former life,
  an encounter with her former husband brought much of it back.
</p>

<p>
  Sadly, Cid's father recently returned as the
  <a href="healer">Great Healer</a>, driven to destroy his only son. He
  succeeded in this endeavor, stabbing Cid with a knife that somehow caused
  Cid's life essence to drain away. Although the Saturday group subsequently
  destroyed the <a href="healer">Great Healer</a> using an antigen
  synthesized by <a href="janus">James Rex</a>, they were too late to save
  Cid's life.
