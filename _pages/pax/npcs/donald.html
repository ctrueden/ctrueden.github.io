<p>
  Donald was a normal guy until he went through a mid-life crisis when his wife
  left him. Seeking guidance, he went walking through the park one day, and
  heard <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> speaking about
  <a href="janell">Janell</a>. Though he was at first amused, something
  about the teaching fascinated him, and ultimately he joined the
  <a href="../groups/janell">Way of Janell</a> as a devout believer in
  its principles.
</p>

<p>
  Along with <a href="philip">Brother Philip</a>, he insists he received
  orders from <a href="janell">Janell</a> herself to track down and kill
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel Miller</a>, because his existence
  supposedly threatened all humankind. They were unsuccessful in this attempt,
  and are currently in jail serving their sentence.
