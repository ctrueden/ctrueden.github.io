<p>
  Half-Pint is a cranky British anarchist who plays soccer for the
  <a href="../groups/miracles">Pax Artificium Miracles</a>. He wears
  a white tank top with a red anarchy symbol painted on the back, and soccer
  shoes with oversized cleats, which he often threatens to utilize against
  whoever is irritating him at the time. Though he at first seemed like a
  profoundly angry person, upon getting to know him better,
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> realized that his bark is worse than his
  bite, and he's actually a pretty good guy. He drives a monster of a
  motorcycle.
