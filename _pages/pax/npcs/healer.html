<p>
  The man once known as Fox Arthur, crushed by the loss of his
  <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">wife</a>, left
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Proto-Magitech</a> behind, deciding to
  travel the world for a time. He ended up wandering Asia, where he encountered
  many people who were poor and sick. He decided to use his mystical talents to
  heal their wounds, and before long, a sort of cult sprang up around his
  miraculous abilities. They called him the Great Healer.
</p>

<p>
  But magic always has its price, and after years of germination, the diseases
  he had healed in others gained an intelligence of their own, taking over his
  mind and body, replacing his compassion with twisted evil.
</p>

<p>
  One goal remained: to destroy
  <a href="cid">the man who was once his son</a>. Fueled by pure hatred,
  he wielded an evil magic pure enough to defeat <a href="cid">Cid's</a>
  tranquility. He recruited many to his new cause, infecting dead criminals
  with his disease, allowing it to gain strength by feasting upon their
  tainted souls.
</p>

<p>
  Although the Wednesday group destroyed the Great Healer's body once, he
  somehow regenerated and returned once more&mdash;this time, accompanied by
  a host of robed individuals apparently from the
  <a href="../groups/janell.html">Way of Janell</a> (though they were thought
  to have been destroyed when Pax Artificium was nuked).
</p>

<p>
  Posing as of one of the <a href="../groups/janell.html">Janellers</a>, the
  Great Healer confronted <a href="cid">Cid</a> and stabbed him. Though
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a> subsequently destroyed him using
  the antigen <a href="janus">James Rex</a> created,
  <a href="cid">Cid</a> did not survive the experience either.
