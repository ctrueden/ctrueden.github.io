<p>
  Thousands of years ago, Janus Ilaris ruled over a proud people. But times
  have changed, the <a href="../races/elves.html">elves</a> are dead, including
  Janus himself, an angry spirit where there was once a king.
</p>

<p>
  It is not known when the spirit of Janus was first able to touch the world,
  but since he has, he has made quite an impact. Under the name "James Rex,"
  Janus made contact with <a href="anna">a young Asian girl</a>, training
  her for years to unlock the powers of her mind. Rex needed someone corporeal,
  someone who could achieve his ends on the plane of material things.
</p>

<p>
  But when <a href="anna">Anna</a> had fully realized her psionic
  potential, she discovered Rex's true plan&mdash;that he considered her just a
  pawn to do with as he pleased. She rebelled against him, and he was forced to
  start anew.
</p>

<p>
  Rex began training three CIA agents: <a href="banks">John Banks</a>,
  <a href="barnes">Melvin Barnes</a> and
  <a href="summers">Ringo Summers</a>. He was quickly able to gain their
  allegiance and secure a position in the CIA for himself. (Though
  <a href="noj">Noj</a> knew Rex was actually Janus, he liked the irony of
  the once king now working for him, and assigned Rex's cell the task of
  infiltrating Pax Artificium.)
</p>

<p>
  Rex took advantage of his position near Pax Artificium to study several
  promising individuals (those in whom he sensed magical potential). He used
  his psionic abilities to flag them, watching them unseen from his bunker
  outside the city.
</p>

<p>
  Having made an alliance with <a href="gaia">Gaia</a>, he coordinated a
  sophisticated and brutal attack against the city, bringing together the
  individuals into one large group that would be dropped right outside his
  door&mdash;or so he planned. In actuality, <a href="cid">Cid</a> ruined
  his plans by closing the psionic door he had opened before the Saturday group
  could pass through it (but after the Wednesday group already had).
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately, he had recruited enough people to proceed with his plans.
  <a href="banks">Banks</a> and <a href="summers">Summers</a>
  convinced the group to gather information from
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> headquarters, testing their
  abilities while simultaneously accomplishing his surface goal of learning
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech's</a> secrets.
</p>

<p>
  When a <a href="anna">ninja</a> stole the stolen computer core from the
  Wednesday group, Rex and his men traveled to Russia to track it down. The
  enmity between Rex and <a href="anna">Anna</a> became apparent when they
  got into a war of psionic mind blasts in the street in broad daylight.
  Meanwhile, the Saturday group escaped with the core (but of course Rex didn't
  really care that much).
</p>

<p>
  Rex continued to guide the fates of both the Wednesday and Saturday groups.
  When Pax Artificium became infected with the
  <a href="healer">Great Healer's</a> sickness, he synthesized an antigen,
  which not only served his interest (it cured the Wednesday group) but also
  became a bargaining chip to get the Saturday group to agree to help with his
  ultimate goal: the destruction of a strange obelisk somehow related to the
  world's magic.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, Rex arranged for both groups to travel to the island with the
  obelisk, so that they could perform a ritual there to destroy it.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel Miller</a> had reservations, due to a
  prophecy that indicated Rex might be seeking vengeance against
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humankind</a> for the destruction of the
  <a href="../races/elves.html">elves</a>, but Rex avoided the issue in the
  simplest way possible: he lied, claiming there was a race more ancient than
  the <a href="../races/elves.html">elves</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Once at the island, however, things went horribly wrong for Rex. The last
  thing <a href="noj">Noj</a> and <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> wanted
  was for anyone to disturb the obelisk; thus, they both showed up to stop the
  group from doing so.
</p>

<p>
  Rex stopped <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> by calling upon
  <a href="gaia">Gaia's</a> aid to swallow him in a tidal wave of imps,
  but <a href="noj">Noj</a> had concocted a more cunning plan. With
  <a href="rixmann">Rixmann</a>'s help (who had developed the technology
  to bind <a href="../races/elves.html">elven</a> spirits into corporeal forms
  as <a href="../races/elves.html">wraiths</a>), <a href="noj">Noj</a>
  bound Rex to his will, creating the "Rex wraith," a disturbingly powerful
  being.
</p>

<p>
  After that, Rex served <a href="noj">Noj</a> and
  <a href="rixmann">Rixmann</a>. Among other things, his powers were used
  to corrupt <a href="bishop">John Bishop's</a> gold dragon.
</p>

<p>
  He was finally stopped, along with all the other
  <a href="../races/elves.html">wraiths</a>, when his spirit was captured in
  the magical vial that had held the souls of Pax Artificium before
  <a href="janell">Janell</a> restored them to life. That vial's dark
  contents were later spilled on <a href="anna">Anna's</a> flesh, nearly
  killing her. Thanks to <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>, however, she survived.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, Rex's spirit had somehow fused with
  <a href="anna">Anna's</a> body, yielding a twisted new creature, torn
  apart from within by self-loathing. <a href="anna">Anna</a> has since
  joined forces with <a href="josef">Josef's evil twin</a>, but to what
  ends, no one is sure...
