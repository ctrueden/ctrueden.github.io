  Kodiak was in the military for many years. After that, he became a hostage
  negotiator for a time, a job at which he excelled. They say he tired of the
  mediocre pay, however, and decided to put his negotation skills to good use
  robbing banks and other high-cash establishments. Now he is wanted in several
  states but has still never been convicted.
