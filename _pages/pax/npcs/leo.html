<p>
  Although General Leo was mocked incessantly for his name as a child and
  during his military training, his rage motivated him, and he rose high up the
  ladder of command. Although the military was largely disbanded and its
  functions taken over by
  <a href="../groups/stratco.html">Strategic Improvements Corporation</a>,
  Leo's role didn't change much.
</p>

<p>
  Once <a href="../groups/stratco.html">StratCo</a> was hired to protect Pax
  Artificium from the monsters that seemed intent on destroying the city, Leo
  was transferred to Pax as the commanding officer in charge of the mission.
  He coordinated the defense parameters, deploying soldiers as needed, and
  issuing other related orders.
</p>

<p>
  Leo was among those wiped out by the strange blast that destroyed Pax
  Artificium. Once he returned and found out
  <a href="../groups/stratco.html">StratCo</a> had fractured into factions,
  and that one of those factions was partially responsible for the incident,
  he wasn't sure what to do. Fortunately,
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> offered him a position within
  the company as chief city defense strategist. He then rehired
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> as one of the city's defenders.
