<p>
  Philip was dissatisfied with his life, thinking he was on a dead end course.
  He turned to the <a href="../groups/janell">Way of Janell</a> to get a
  fresh start at life.
</p>

<p>
  Along with <a href="donald">Brother Donald</a>, he insists he received
  orders from <a href="janell">Janell</a> herself to track down and kill
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel Miller</a>, because his existence
  supposedly threatened all humankind. They were unsuccessful in this attempt,
  and are currently in jail serving their sentence.
