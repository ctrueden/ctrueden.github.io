  Sartus was once somewhat of a scholar among the
  <a href="../races/elves">elves</a>, taking it upon himself to chronicle
  the events surrounding the construction of the ancient obelisk. Now, like
  most of his people, his body is long dead, and his spirit has been fused with
  the body of a deceased <a href="../races/humans">human</a>, yielding a
  wraith.
</p>

<p>
  Though Sartus and <a href="benek">Benek</a> (friends during life) served
  their king, <a href="janus">Janus Ilaris</a>, faithfully, they grew
  increasingly concerned when it became clear that
  <a href="janus">Janus's</a> sole purpose for their people was to exact
  revenge upon the <a href="../races/humans">human</a> descendants of
  the ones responsible for their people's demise.
</p>

<p>
  When <a href="janus">Janus</a> himself became bound in wraith form and
  was no longer his own master, Sartus and <a href="benek">Benek</a> were
  uncertain what to do next. But once they learned that their people had been
  miraculously born anew within the barren womb of
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara Cassenti</a>, they realized a better, more
  harmonious route lay ahead. Even if their spirits are twisted beyond
  redemption, Sartus and <a href="benek">Benek</a> have vowed to do
  whatever is necessary to protect <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara's</a> twins,
  to ensure the rebirth and survival of their once-proud race.
