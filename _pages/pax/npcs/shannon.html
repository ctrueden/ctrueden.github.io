  Shannon is an intelligent young Irish woman who works for
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> as a technician. Though fairly
  shy while at work, she does her share of partying during her off hours. She
  has had a crush on her boss <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam Connor</a> for
  some time, but didn't work up the courage to say anything until recently.

  New Years Eve, Shannon got caught up in the latest set of misadventures.

  the <a href="../groups/five">Fabulous Four</a>, she disappeared, and her
  current whereabouts are unknown...
