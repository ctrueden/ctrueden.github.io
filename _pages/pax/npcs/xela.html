<p>
  Xela was one of six <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a> (along with
  <a href="noj">Noj</a> and <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a>) that
  assisted the <a href="../races/dwarves.html">dwarven</a> builders and
  <a href="../races/humans.html">human</a> wizards in building the strange
  obelisk over two thousand years ago. Although <a href="noj">Noj</a> and
  <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> were her friends back then, she has told a
  tale of woe detailing how they betrayed her, leaving her for dead floating in
  the Indian Ocean, along with her broken mystical amulet.
</p>

<p>
  She has since had assistance retrieving it, and has managed to repair it,
  after being rescued from the bowels of a gigantic leviathan by our brave
  heroes. She traveled with both the Wednesday and Saturday groups for a time,
  disappearing during the confrontation between
  <a href="janus">James Rex</a>, <a href="noj">Noj</a> and
  <a href="sitruc">Sitruc</a> on the island in the Bermuda Triangle.
</p>

<p>
  Six months later, <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel Miller</a> encountered
  her in Canada, posing as a collector of antiquities named Anastassia Zelakov.
  She wants the Saturday group to recover the circlet that
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> lost in exchange for the return of
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> flute.
