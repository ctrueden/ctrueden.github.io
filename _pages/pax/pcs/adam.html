  Alas, poor Adam! None knew him well, and that included Adam himself. When a
  promotion he had worked all of his professional life for slipped by, Adam
  abandoned the life he had constructed and took to the highways in search of a
  new one. When he arrived at Pax Artificium, he discovered many things. He
  discovered that creatures of fantasy still walked the earth. He discovered
  that magic was alive and well. Unfortunately, he failed to discover himself.
  As each member in the group to which he had been attached found his or her
  little niche, Adam continued to ask, "What about me?" Sadly, his question was
  never answered before his death.
