  Roberto "Bobby" Garibaldi is the seventh son of a seventh son, something not
  lost on observers, who notice that he seems to be able to get what he wants
  done, even if it's impossible. Some speak to bribery, some speak to his
  Rominovisky (Gypsie to you Rubes) Grandmother, and others just speak to
  extra-ordinary Luck.
</p>

<p>
  Unluckily for Bobby, this family that he was born into is a family of crime.
  Old allegiances, and old debts (not to mention old enmities) fillied his
  childhood, and steeped him in a KNOWING that the world had to follow what
  went before, or all was lost. Raised on the particularly Mob-strain of
  Catholicism, he's devoted to his faith, and the only thing that MIGHT be
  higher is his family... but that hasn't come into the clutch yet, thanks to
  the particular way it has been taught to him. 
</p>

<p>
  Bobby is always dressed in VERY expensive Suits, from very small, family
  owned tailor shops that craft their suits by hand. He normally wears his
  Black hair combed straight back. 
<p>

<p>
  Bobby only recently graduated from Law School, and it was there that some of
  the basic principles he had held since infancy had started to come under
  question. What if being Crime Lords... WASN'T Ok? This has led him to be on
  the look-out for answers... but not just any answers.
</p>

<p>
  He was recenltly Sent after one (Father)
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Raphael Douglas</a> by his father, who knew
  that he had particular Skills in finding people. Upon finding him, he was to
  find out why this person, whom the family had never heard of, was to be, "put
  on permanent vacation." Strange things had been going on, strange people
  ordered for elimination, and Family Garibaldi wanted to know why the People
  Higher Up (PHU) in the Organization were ordering these.
