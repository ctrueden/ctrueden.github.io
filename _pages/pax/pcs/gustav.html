  Gustav Weiner was chief research scientist in
  <a href="../groups/stratco">StratCo</a>. He was given free
  reign over his department, because his miraculous abilities provided
  substantial income for the company. After the coup, Gustav aligned himself
  with <a href="../npcs/rixmann">Rixmann's</a> group. Obeying his orders
  with alacrity, Gustav met his untimely end in an attempt to kill the group of
  misfits he'd been gadding about with.
