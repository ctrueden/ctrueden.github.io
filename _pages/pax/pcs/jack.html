<p>
  Jack Daniels was born and raised in Lousiana. He was raised by his mother,
  as he father left while he was still young. His mother, a devoute southern
  baptist, raised Jack with a heavy emphasis on belief.
</p>

<p>
  Jack's mother is also superstitious and treats the tabloids with the same
  respect that she treats the bible. In his teen years, Jack was wise enough to
  question the tabloids, and began to question everything.
</p>

<p>
  His attempts to discount everything his mother believed in quickly failed as
  even the craziest story turned out to have at least a grain of truth.
</p>

<p>
  Jack grew into a large and powerful young man. Most people were scared of
  him, and so he filled his days with tinkering with cars. There were no
  shortage of old worn down cars to work on. Before he knew it, he had a
  successful car tuning business.
</p>

<p>
  He got married in his late twenties. Unfortunately, his wife disappeared
  several years ago. After two years without any sign of his wife he knew he
  had to move on. He sold his tuning business and headed to Pax Artificium to
  start a new life.
</p>

<p>
  Jack arrived in Pax right as it was opened to the public. He found a job
  bouncing at the Angels nightclub. Before the move, Jack was most comfortable
  hanging out in rough country bars. He wore overalls, drank cheap beer, and
  ate whatever was handy. In his new job he has to wear a suit, look and act
  professional, and relate to a clientelle that consited of the movers and
  shakers in Pax. Now that he's adjusted to his new lifestyle, he is never seen
  wearing anything but a nice suit.
