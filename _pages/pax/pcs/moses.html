  When the self-dubbed "World's Last Traveling Circus" camped out one winter,
  acrobats Mark and Mary Morningbird discovered a basket containing a small
  baby floating in the stream by the camp. They adopted the child and named him
  Moses. After a brief childhood in the circus, Moses was sent to boarding
  school, where he found a world to his liking in comic books and graphic
  novels. Then, his abilities surfaced, along with the nightmares. As his life
  started mirroring comic books, MOses was plagued with a crushing sense of
  obligation. After Pax Artificium was destroyed, Moses went there to help
  rebuild it. once that was done, MOses stayed to protect it, under the guise
  of the Speed Demon!
