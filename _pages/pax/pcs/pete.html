<p>
As a doppleganger, William Moss was born out of a fissure in the earth, with no name and no past.  One of the head researchers of <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>, <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Fox Arthur</a>, found William as he wandered, shifting aimlessly from form to form around him, in the first few days after he came to be.  He quickly befriended <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Fox</a>, <a href="zuul">Dana</a>, and the young <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid Arthur</a>, and they did their best to raise him and learn what he was.  He chose the name William Moss for himself, and normally appears as a man of average height with short brown hair, green eyes, and glasses, and a generally bookish appearance.  He wears well-fitting, well-tailored clothes.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>, he performed odd jobs, some of questionable moral standing. When <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a> transmigrated to become a computerized soul and became the head of Magitech, William Moss acted as a surrogate physical body when <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a> needed to make public appearances.
</p>

<p>
However, several years ago, William was kidnapped by <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a>, then president of the United States, and his mind controlled.  At first he was given combat training and used as an assassin and spy, but long-term mind control had its toll, and his behavior became very erratic. His mind was wiped and he was left in Pax Artificium to spy on the city, in the form of a bum named Crazy Pete.
</p>

<p>
Since then, he has been purged of the mind control by <a href="../npcs/janus.html">James Rex</a>, and after <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a> death, he assumed control of <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> by posing as <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a>.
