<p>
  The teenage boy known as Sam Smitts was very sick, infected with a prion that
  acted much like early onset Alzheimers, but for which scientists had no
  direct cure. Sam's parents decided to try a radical new precedure, developed
  from neural jack technology, wherein an artificial neural network would be
  injected into his skull, with individual nodes replacing his failing neurons
  over time.
</p>

<p>
  The operation went smoothly, but when Sam woke up, his blank stare indicated
  that something was wrong. Although he was told that the concerned people
  standing over him were his parents, he had no memory of them, or of much else
  for that matter.
</p>

<p>
  After two more days in the hospital, he snatched some cash from his father's
  wallet and walked out, still in his hospital gown. Sam&mdash;who kept his
  given name but now prefers his online handle, Zuul&mdash;moved on to a new
  life, established himself as a hacker for hire on the Net, and moved to Pax
  Artificium.
</p>

<p>
  Since the surgery, Zuul found himself to be extremely talented with
  computers, although even he wasn't always sure how he did it. He made a good
  living, but still couldn't remember a thing about his childhood.
</p>

<p>
  However, when Zuul encountered a strange individual known as the
  <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Great Healer</a>, he began having strange
  flashbacks. In particular, the name "Fox" kept springing to mind.
</p>

<p>
  When Zuul finally met <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a>, his memory flooded
  back to him, and he remembered his life as a woman named Dana Arthur,
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a> mother.
  <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Fox</a> was her husband,
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a> father, now the
  <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Great Healer</a>. Somehow, Dana's consciousness
  had survived and fused itself with Zuul's artificial neural network.
</p>

<p>
  This realization changed little for Zuul, except to strengthen his devotion
  to <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a>. When the
  <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Great Healer</a> returned and killed
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a>, Zuul was saddened, but since all of his
  emotions were dulled by the procedure, he was not heartbroken. Instead, he
  buried himself in his work, helping to rebuild Pax Artificium after its
  destruction at the hands of <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a> and the U.S.
  government. He now works as a <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>
  technician, keeping the sensor grid and other vital but secret technologies
  running smoothly, and designing new defenses to protect the city.
</p>

<p>
  Zuul was last seen in the <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>
  HQ control tower, monitoring the Saturday group at the skylift, attempting to
  find the source of the wireless interference. When
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> investigated his disappearance the next
  day, he observed a <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> employee
  with a tag reading "Robert Patrick" sneak up behind Zuul and knock him
  unconscious before erasing the evidence and dragging the kid away...
