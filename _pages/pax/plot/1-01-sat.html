<p>
  Attacks against Pax Artificium happen once every week or so.  Lately, the
  attacking monsters have been getting bigger and badder, until three weeks
  ago, they just stopped.
</p>

<h3>
  Session start: Saturday, June 4, 2033 &ndash;
  1800 hours &ndash; downtown Pax Artificium
</h3>

<h2>Jack</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is at Angels nightclub, working as head
  bouncer as usual. He hears near-simultaneous gunshots coming from the back
  room, followed by many screams, as people flood out the doors in a mob,
  trying to leave the club. The emergency exit alarms sound as people exit
  through every possible avenue. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>
  investigates, locking two stray customers in a room for safekeeping.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> sees monsters on the street, then returns
  to the room where he had locked the people. Upon opening the door, the people
  are not there, but instead there are two more monsters, which attack him! He
  immediately locks one back into the room, and fends off the other.
</p>

<p>
  He goes to his apartment on the second floor to check something on his
  computer. Then, just as he is engulfed by an expanding wave of white light
  emanating from the city's center, he is thrown him out his window to the
  street below.
</p>

<h2>Daniel</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> was about to lose his job at the
  university, but was then hired at Pax University, a more "progressive"
  institution.  The semester has just ended, and he is celebrating with some of
  his graduate students, by throwing a small get-together at his house.
</p>

<p>
  One of the grad students asks <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> if he's
  every really "watched people," and starts explaining some weird stuff he's
  seen (a guy who sits perfectly still for minutes on end when no one is buying
  anything from his newspaper stand), but is interrupted&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  The doorbell rings.
  <a href="../npcs/donald.html">Door-to-door missionaries</a> answer his door.
  "Mr. Miller?" one asks. When he responds in the affirmative, the other one
  says, "God have mercy on our souls," and stabs him with a knife. His grad
  students drive the men off, then call an ambulance for him, and he is on his
  way there when the city is attacked. A strange, burrowing monster leaps
  through the concrete street and crashes into the ambulance, toppling it. The
  medics present are dead, and <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> is
  unconscious in the back of the ambulance, near
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Pete's</a> alley...
</p>

<h2>Buck and Liam</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a> is a current member of the Pax Artificium
  city council. He is the leading candidate for the first elected mayor of Pax
  Artificium (election to take place in April, 2034). He is part of a tour of
  the skylift happening at 1800 hours.
</p>

<p>
  After the completion of Pax Artificium, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  moved there to begin work on the next big
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> project: deployment on the
  moon. The first step was designing and building a geosynchronous space
  station, and a connecting skylift between Pax and the satellite. Today is
  maintenance day for the skylift on the ground level (it runs on a 12-day
  cycle: five days from Pax to the station, one day of maintenance on the
  station, five days from the station back to Pax, and one day of maintenance
  on the ground).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is meeting with
  <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Mr. Masterson</a> and several others in the
  afternoon to assist with giving a tour of the skylift and explain some of the
  technology behind it. They meet, and the tour begins.
</p>

<p>
  As they enter one of the overlook decks, there is a rumbling.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> recognizes it as being the skylift's
  engines! <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and one other engineer go for
  the emergency stop, but the homeless man who started the lift tries to stop
  them, gibbering about "escaping the danger," then runs out of the room.
</p>

<p>
  The homeless man sees <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a>, points and shouts,
  "YOU!" and tackles him. They go crashing out one of the windows (something
  that shouldn't be possible, due to the extremely thick plexiglass). They
  fall, then land, <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a> on top. The homeless guy
  is dead. <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a> is unconscious, near
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Pete's</a> alley. The lift seems to be impossible
  for <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> to stop. He and the others are going
  inexorably upward. If he can't stop the lift, they'll die from decompression
  due to the broken window. From high above the city, he sees an expanding
  white light engulf the city below...
</p>

<h2>Crazy Pete</h2>

<p>
  A homeless man, <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Pete</a> is currently sitting in
  an alley outside of Angels. An ambulance comes careening down the street, but
  a monster smashes forth from the concrete and barrels into the ambulance,
  toppling it. Then two men fall from the sky. One of them is his friend Bob,
  who is dead. <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a> is badly hurt.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Pete</a>, bemused, drags the bodies of Bob,
  <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a>, <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> (from the back of the ambulance)
  together. Just as he's got them all in a neat row, a glowing white door he's
  never seen before is present in your alleyway.
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Crazy Pete</a> feels strangely compelled to go
  through, and bring "the others." <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Pete</a> tosses
  Bob through the door, saying, "It's heaven, Bob! You're going to heaven!"
  Before he can do the others, though, a <a href="../npcs/cid.html">man in a
  golden coat and thick glasses</a> stumbles into the alleyway and throws up.
  He looks up, sees the door, and says, "No!" Then passes out as well. The door
  disappears.
</p>

<p>
  A helicopter flies overhead, and lands outside the alley. Several figures in
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> uniforms leave the copter and
  wake the man in the golden coat, who then instructs them to take
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Pete</a> into custody, along with all the
  unconscious people.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone awakens in nicely furnished rooms, and a guard appears, requesting
  that they follow him to a conference room. In that room, the man from before
  enters, and introduces himself as
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Dr. Cid Arthur</a>, the head of
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech Corporation</a>.
