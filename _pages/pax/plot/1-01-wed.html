<p>
  Attacks against Pax Artificium happen once every week or so.  Lately, the
  attacking monsters have been getting bigger and badder, until three weeks
  ago, they just stopped.
</p>

<h3>
  Session start: Saturday, June 4, 2033 &ndash;
  1800 hours &ndash; downtown Pax Artificium
</h3>

<h2>Gerald</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> is hanging out at Angels nightclub
  with some buddies. Chadzor, Biggs, Wedge, Johnson and Redshirt... Everyone
  gets a message from HQ. It's gibberish, a flood of data. Like someone stuck a
  fire hose in his brain and turned it on.
</p>

<p>
  Then, all the men simultaneously kill themselves, except for
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>. He has the urge, but resists it.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> is extremely disoriented. As panic
  ensues and people flee the club en masse,
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> is pushed and prodded out the door...
</p>

<h2>Sara</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> is preaching to those who follow the
  <a href="../groups/janell.html">Way of Janell</a>. She gets a prophetic
  message from <a href="../npcs/janell.html">Janell</a>: "Trouble appears
  with the evening stars. A great threat arises within the city's walls. The
  flock finds shelter here, but the shepherdess seeks a defender of men, unlike
  others, beneath holy wings."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> begins walking a direction that feels
  right, looking for this "defender of men." She hears a loud collection of
  bangs, like several guns going off at once. In that direction, she sees the
  Angels nightclub, and the statues atop it. She figures out that the hint
  indicates this nightclub, and gets together with
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> as he leaves in a daze, just as the
  city comes under attack by the monsters. <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>
  follows a series of portents: three white dogs running by, three white
  pigeons that fly a separate direction from the rest of the scattered flock,
  and three orphan children dressed in white running into an alleyway.
  <a href="../npcs/janell.html">Janell</a> has led them to some kind of
  portal&mdash;a slightly ajar door bathed in white light...
</p>

<h2>Josef</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> is in cyberspace when his surrounding
  change to that of a strangely lit street. He sees millions of ants swarming
  around cracks in a building. He tries to jack out and finds that he cannot
  (which shouldn’t be possible). The ants are marching in a line toward a
  distant area that turns out to be a door to a building he hasn't seen before.
  Through the door, he finds they are crawling into a file cabinet, which when
  opened, produces a file detailing a neurovirus that has "total command
  authority over the target brain."
</p>

<p>
  A man in a suit asks <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> what he is doing,
  and when <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> turns around, the man draws a
  gun and shoots <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> in the arm. When he
  feels real pain, he notices his display has gone semi-immersive, and he tries
  to jack out of cyberspace again. This time it works, but when he awakens in
  the real world, the same man is standing in the same spot, with the smoking
  gun still pointed at him.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> attempts to fight the man, and
  experiences his own death. But upon dying, he finds himself back in front of
  the man with the smoking gun, as though snapping out of a waking dream. He
  then runs, chased by the man. Somehow, miraculously, he evades the man, but
  is chased into an alleyway, where he finds himself at a door that emits a
  strange, glowing white light from beneath it...
</p>

<h2>Adam</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/adam.html">Adam</a> just got into town. He sees some people
  that then turn into monsters and attack him. He gets backed into an alleyway,
  and he is backed against the wall, completely cornered. The monsters approach
  him, but now don’t seem to be able to see him. Strangely, they give up and
  wander away. Then, he sees a door in the alleyway—a door he hadn’t noticed
  before. He sees a woman go through, leading a strangely short bearded man.
  The door is strangely compelling...
</p>

<h2>United</h2>

<p>
The united party finds themselves in the desert, known to be dangerous to
travelers on foot. The desert is strewn with massive skeletons of defeated
monsters that have assaulted the city. <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>
even recognizes a monster or two that he helped defeat. Behind them, they see a
wave of imp-like creatures swarming over the city walls. Then they see a
strange, semi-circular expanding shell grow around the city, destroying the
assaulting creatures, which then fade from view.
</p>

<p>
  They are then attacked by other desert monsters. They are saved by men in
  desert camouflage with sniper rifles and tranquilizer guns, but then ordered
  to surrender their weapons. The party is taken into custody.
</p>
