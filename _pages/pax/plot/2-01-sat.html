  Thanks to Oz for this detailed transcript.
</p>

<p>
  During the 6 months after the death and dismemberment of
  <a href="../npcs/sitruc.html">Sitruc</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a>, members of the "band" have gone their
  separate ways, occasionally staying in touch. Since then, Pax has been
  rebuilt. Roughly a third of the population has left Pax, deciding for various
  reasons that the strange goings on aren't worth being there.
</p>

<p>
  Worldwide, the organized monster attacks have ceased entirely. The creatures
  are still out there in the wild, occasionally making headlines with an attack
  or two. Things have seemed to fall back to normal.
</p>

<p>
  Anti-terrorism has been collapsing. Until the next election in 2036, Senate
  Majority Leader Morgan Russell has been confirmed as president. Many congress
  members are reversing their stances on outsourcing security and other vital
  functions to the corporate enterprises. Most responsibilities have been
  reverted back to governmental agencies.
</p>

<p>
  The war between China-India-Russia and the US-Europe has ended. Various
  political rife from before the war is returning back into lime-light of the
  world stage. It is rumored that a conflict in Asia is likely.
</p>

<h2>In local news</h2>

<em>
<p>
  The <a href="../groups/miracles.html">Pax Miracles</a>, who have been on
  hiatus, will have their first game tomorrow afternoon (January 1, 2034).
</p>

<p>
  Fireworks and light displays tonight at Pax above Masterson Park are
  expected to draw thousands as the city celebrates the reconstruction of the
  city. I'm sure <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a> is up there somewhere
  smiling down on the citizens of our fair town.
</p>

<p>
  With <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck's</a> sad death, Chuck Xavier is
  expected to will the mayor race early next year.
</p>
</em>

<h2>In world news</h2>

<em>
<p>
  The <a href="../groups/stratco.html">Strategic Improvements Corporation</a>
  court case determining ownership of the multi-trillion dollar corporation was
  settled out of court. The former board members have come to some sort of
  agreement. Former <a href="../groups/stratco.html">StratCo</a> Vice President
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Ingolf Rixmann</a> was named the new CEO.
</p>
</em>

<h2>Pre-session character developments</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> honed his magical abilities, physically
  improving himself and creating a few devices. A magical stethoscope that
  heals injuries created a massive wound through his chest to his heart. It has
  since healed, but left a nasty scar. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> has
  been volunteering with sports medicine doctor Scott Haley out of Seattle in a
  free clinic.
</p>

<p>
  One of <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt's</a> rings has the ability to
  teleport him to Pax (room in mansion), Seattle (storage facility), and
  <a href="../npcs/sitruc.html">Sitruc's</a> former mansion in Russia each once
  per day. Creating that ring permanently reduced
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt's</a> reflexes (Dexterity loss of 1
  permanently).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> has created two machines that he can
  mentally move using Kinetic mystic ability. These machines allow him to
  interface with other machines and computers from a distance.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> returned from Germany a few days before
  New Years Eve to learn that
  <a href="../npcs/mike.html">one of his co-workers</a> has set up Angels to
  host a public party that is being billed as "The Party" to celebrate Pax's
  miraculous recovery. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is quite upset and
  informs <a href="../npcs/mike.html">his co-worker</a> that it will never
  happen again!
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> spent some time improving his car's
  suspension with some technology from Germany and his own abilities. These
  "smart wheels" can handle various terrains from stairs to rocks to sand.
</p>

<h3>
  Session start: Saturday, December 31, 2033 – evening (Pacific time)
</h3>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon Bailey</a>&mdash;an attractive, mousy,
  shy engineer-type that gives the vibe of being a partier&mdash;works on
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam's</a> team at
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> and has silently been
  attracted to <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> for months. Absorbed in his
  work, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> hasn't noticed her constant hints.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is close to a breakthrough on the skylift
  project and calls in his team to work New Years Eve. On this particular day,
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> decides to ask
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> to "The Party" at Angels for New Years.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, very surprised, agrees, but only if they
  can finish their work. <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> smiles and
  says they better get to work!
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> sleeps in quite late after working all
  night on the car.
</p>

<p>
  During the day, <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> is at the free clinic
  helping out emergency patients in Seattle.
</p>

<p>
  After a long day's work with <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon's</a>
  heightened motivation, the team is able to get things working (although not
  perfected). More testing will be needed before everything will be ready.
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> is quite satisfied and already has
  reservations at Angels private party for two.
</p>

<p>
  At Angels, <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is working security dressed in
  a high-class suit (which is standard uniform). Much to
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack's</a> disgust, the dress code has been
  suspended for the public party (at least on the first floor).
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> watches as a
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">seven-and-a-half foot giant of a man</a> comes
  into the bar in jeans, a soccer jersey, and a face painted half gold and half
  white.
</p>

<p>
  After working some more, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> realizes that it
  is almost time to meet with <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a>.
  Almost on cue, she walks in dressed to the nines looking very sexy. They only
  have fifteen minutes to get to Angels.
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> asks if
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is going to change.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> freaks out, realizing he does not have
  time to get the appropriate attire. He calls
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>, who calmly states that he'll handle
  everything and to just get to Angels.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and the rest of the soccer team get to
  Angels after hopping around various bars.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">A very large man</a> in a soccer jersey and with
  a painted face enthusiastically introduces himself to
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> as
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>. He says he is a huge fan, procuring
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>’s rookie card and asking him to
  sign it. He says he used to play football, but blew out his knee.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> get to Angels.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is led to a changing room, while
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> is brought to their table.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>, getting very hungry, orders
  fifteen pizza pies.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> gets into a very distinguished suit and
  joins <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> just as the ball drops in
  New York.
</p>

<p>
  A <a href="../pcs/lee.html">pizza-delivery man</a> with the name "Lee" sewn
  into his jacket shows up at Angels. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is
  quite upset at this, telling <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> that food
  isn't allowed in. He tells <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> that one
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">"Half-Pint"</a> ordered these pizzas and
  assured him that it would be okay.
</p>

<p>
  Upstairs in the private party, a jazz band is performing. The nightclub
  lights flicker a few times. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> immediately
  wants to see what's going on, but <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a>
  persuades him with a gentle kiss that he really doesn't want to do that. They
  continue to enjoy the wine and music.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> lets <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> in
  to check on the generators in the basement. There should have been no
  flickering of lights, with their generators. Upon inspecting the generators,
  he sees that they ran for fifteen seconds.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> calls the generator company, leaving a
  message that something went wrong with the generators at Angels.
</p>

<p>
  At "The Party," all the televisions were static for fifteen seconds. As the
  reception came back, the television personalities hosting the event mention
  that there was just a power outage in New York that affected cell phone
  communications as well.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> calls the mansion and check to see if
  everything is okay. They state that
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Dr. Arthur</a> is looking into it.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> picks up the pizza pies, giving
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> a great tip.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> are engrossed in the moment, when
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> interrupts them.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> tells <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  about the power outage that seemed to be national, affecting all cell phone
  communications as well. As <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is saying
  this, he notices one of the flower bouquets is wilting, then buzzing is in
  the air, and that reality seems distorted (right in front of them).
</p>

<p>
  Out of seemingly thin air, <a href="../npcs/milo.html">a midget</a> with a
  mane of hair in shabby clothes (Renaissance Fair-like) tugs on
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack's</a> clothing saying, "Milo's friends want
  her to sing. If she sings, you'll be taken away. Don't let her take you
  away." Near the stage a beautiful woman singing steps up to the stage from
  the crowd heading for the microphone.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> moves to kick the microphone, while
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> plugs his ears.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> doesn't recognize the woman, but she is
  about to reach the microphone, and another flickering of power happens.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> hears the beautiful singing through his
  fingers in his ears and is transfixed. He starts moving towards the stage.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> reaches for the power and unplugs the
  microphone.
</p>

<p>
  Below at the public party, they can hear this woman's music in the distant
  background. <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>, <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> notice that everyone else seems to be
  still enrapt in the music.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> becomes like dust and is absorbed into a
  mystical swirl of color and light, feeling like his head is floating in the
  clouds. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> stuns the woman. As she crumples
  to the ground, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> crashes to the floor from
  what seems like a perilous fall.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> head up to see the situation and see a
  woman in pain on the ground. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> goes to his
  car to get his med-kit. The beautiful woman gets up and
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> handcuffs her, escorting her out of
  Angels through the backdoor. She tries to enchant
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> with her singing, but
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> covers her mouth and pushes her out into
  the alley. A <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">figure in the alley</a> dressed
  in priestly robes holding a book and a large cross approaches, "I see you
  have delivered unto me a demon." <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> shuts
  the door as the woman shouts for help.
</p>

<p>
  As <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is walking back to the main floor, he
  is affected by the woman's singing in the distance. Then a scream ends the
  singing and <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> snaps out of it. He goes to
  use his cell phone to call security to find out what is going on in the
  alley. His cell phone has no service.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> hears the woman's voice in his head
  beckoning for his help, with an image of impending danger from a
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">mad priest</a> threatening with a cross in the
  back alley. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> feels sympathy towards this
  woman and moves to check on her. At the front door, he runs into
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> convinces
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  that it isn't safe to go out into the alley.
</p>

<p>
  Out in back, <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> burst into the alley. The
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">priest</a> is attacking the woman with the
  large cross, pressing it against her forehead with a sound of sizzling.
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> join the fray as
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> watches in confusion.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> notices the silent alarm for the back
  door and swears under his breath. He tells
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  to follow him.
</p>

<p>
  The woman begins singing some violent song about vikings.
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> becomes transfixed and walks
  towards her. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> grabs him. The woman
  moves forward and touches <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>. He
  begins to "phase" out and <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> arms go
  through <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> as though he were made
  of sand. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> rush out into the alley and both become
  transfixed, walking towards the woman. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  shoots her, and <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> then smashes her with
  a garbage can.
</p>

<p>
  Amazingly, the woman is still standing and runs away. We follow down the
  alley when a monstrously large dog attacks
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  shoots her again and she crumples to the ground.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> notices that the woman's wounds are
  healing at a magically fast rate. The Priest threatens her with a large
  stake, demanding she release those she has taken.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> pins the dog, but it then vanishes
  and reappears between <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and the woman. The
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">priest</a> stakes the woman through the heart
  as she arcs in pain. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> pummels the dog
  within an inch of its life with electric knuckles. The dog takes the woman in
  his massive jaw and tries to get away suing some mystic ability. The group
  pummels the heck out of the dog as it slumps, dropping the limp woman's body
  to the ground.
