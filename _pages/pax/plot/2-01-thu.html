  Session start: Saturday, December 31, 2033 &ndash;
  0100 hours PST &ndash; downtown Pax Artificium
</h3>

<h2>Daniel</h2>

<p>
  Once Pax Artificium University is rebuilt in October,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> resumes his work there. The new
  semester is starting mid-January, and he wants to be ready. Meanwhile, he is
  attempting to contact God through occult and spiritual means (primarily
  Kabbalistic) with the aid of his program. On New Years Eve, he finally
  succeeds.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> meditates, attempting to talk to God.
  His radio spontaneously turns on, and he hears the voice of
  <a href="../npcs/banks.html">Banks</a> on the line.
  "<a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel Miller</a>, this is
  <a href="../npcs/banks.html">John Banks</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/summers.html">Ringo Summers</a>. We know you're listening.
  We need your help." He explains that they are trapped in a place called the
  Astral plane, along with some people who wish to speak with him. A man named
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> interrupts in a scratchy voice,
  asking if <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Miller</a> has heard of an ancient
  Babylonian instrument, capable of opening gates between worlds.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> plows on, saying
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> isn't a very good expert on ancient
  religions if he hasn't heard of it. <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a>
  tells him it has been lost, but that he believes it still exists. He tells
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> to find it, bring it to the island
  where the obelisk lies, and to play it so that they can be freed from their
  long captivity.
</p>

<p>
  "And <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Miller</a>," he says, "Don't trust anyone.
  At least one of your friends is working for the enemy."
</p>

<h2>Erica</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html"><a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> Banyon</a> receives a call from
  <a href="../groups/mms.html">MMS</a> informing her that it is time to
  reinventory any personal items that she wishes to keep insured. (Typically,
  this is done with a scanning rod, with any items she wishes to insure in
  plain sight.) They schedule the inventory for the next morning (Saturday) at
  8 am. 
</p>

<p>
  That night, <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> awakens to the sound
  strange, feminine voices outside her window. They blend together musically,
  with intriguing, overlapping overtones. Looking outside, she sees figures
  wearing swirling, almost ethereal black robes. One turns its head, and
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> sees the image of a pale woman, with
  glowing white eyes, looking toward her. The woman looks surprised and opens
  her mouth, unleashing an unearthly scream.
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> falls unconscious, as all the windows
  in the entire apartment complex shatter simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
  In the morning, <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> alarm wakes her, and
  she recalls the dream she had, noticing that none of the windows are broken.
  Ten minutes before eight, there is a knock on her door. It is the
  <a href="../groups/mms.html">MMS</a> guy. He is wearing a suit, carries a
  steel briefcase and has dark sunglasses on as well.
</p>

<p>
  "Good day," he says, "I am Armin Reed from
  <a href="../groups/mms.html">Money Management Solutions</a>. I'm here to do
  an inventory of your personal items, for insurance purposes." He proceeds to
  scan the items she has made available to him. There is another knock on
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> door. When she answers it, it is
  another man who claims to be Armin Reed. When she turns around, she sees that
  the first Reed has disappeared, as has her prized possession, a flute of some
  value.
</p>

<h2>Dirk</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> has been charged with the task of
  investigating potentially anomalous individuals from Pax Artificium, to
  verify their status. He has designed an arm module for this task that can
  specify "type A" (increased anomalous particle count within and surrounding
  the body), "type B" (differences in individual DNA strands), "type AB" (both
  A and B), or "type O" (normal). It also identifies the "strength factor" of
  the anomalous activity. His arm's database keeps track of the findings.
</p>

<p>
  The first person on <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk's</a> list is
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica Banyon</a>. His government has arranged a
  cover identity for him: Armin Reed of <a href="../groups/mms.html">MMS</a>.
  But when he shows up at <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> apartment,
  he gets more than he bargained for...
</p>

<h2>Daniel</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> searches the Net for information on
  the ancient Babylonian flute, but has no luck determining its current
  whereabouts. Just when he is about to give up for the night, he feels an
  alien presence in his mind. Though the voice speaks in a whisper, it is still
  the most overwhelming thing <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> has ever
  experienced. "ERICA BANYON," it whispers. "SEEK THE FLUTE. HURRY." Something
  about the voice brings images of Cthulu to
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel's</a> mind.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> takes a late-night train to
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> area of town. As he approaches her
  apartment building, he sees three ghostly figures floating outside one side
  of the apartment. They do not appear to see
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> as he crouches behind a nearby bush.
  He notices a woman peering out one of the apartment windows at the figures,
  and he sees that one of them notices the woman as well. The figure screams,
  and <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> passes out as all the windows of
  the apartment building appear to break yet not break simultaneously.
</p>

<h2>Erica, Dirk and Daniel</h2>

<p>
  The next morning, <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> awakens and
  verifies that the window from which the woman peered last night was one of
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> windows. He knocks on her door and
  introduces himself as <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel Miller</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> is there, and notices that
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> is type A, which seems like an
  unlikely coincidence.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> excuses himself to the bathroom so that
  he can call his base, as he was ordered to report anything unusual. His boss
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> instructs him to bring them in,
  telling the truth about his mission if necessary to convince them.
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> also suggests that they may be able
  to help determine what happened to <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a>
  flute. <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> that he works for the Canadian
  government, and eventually they agree to accompany him back to Canada.
</p>

<h2>Betty and Frank</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty Brown</a>, a nervous jewel thief, has
  recently acquired a jeweled circlet from an L.A. museum on behalf of a client
  from Vancouver, British Columbia. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>'s
  associate, <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank Furio</a>, flies a plane,
  transporting people and goods in an "unofficial" capacity.
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> has agreed to take her across the
  border so that she can rendezvous with her client later that evening.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately for <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> plane is equipped with the latest
  anti-radar technology, including augmentations courtesy of Canada.
  Unfortunately, this technology was given to
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> with the understanding that his
  services could be called upon to transport Canadian agents as the Canadian
  government deems necessary.
</p>

<p>
  As <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> boards the plane,
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> receives a call from
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a>, who he has transported a couple of times
  before, saying that his services are needed to take
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> and two others back to Canada right away.
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> informs
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> that he is just about to take off with
  another client, but eventually agrees to pick up
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> as well, since the two destinations are
  similar.
</p>

<h2>United</h2>

<p>
  When <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> boards the plane, he discovers that
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> is also anomalous. He insists that
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> travel to the base before dropping off
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> in Vancouver (so that he can have her
  taken into custody there as well).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> senses a powerful force within
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty's</a> pack, and sees a ring shape glowing
  from within. Something about it is extremely compelling, but
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> senses
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel's</a> unhealthy interest and guards the
  pack even more fiercely than usual.
</p>

<p>
  As the plane nears the Canadian border,
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> notices two blips near the edge of his
  radar, traveling on a trajectory similar to his own. He adjusts his course
  to keep the blips near the edge of his radar, not letting them get too close.
</p>

<p>
  After traveling this way for a couple of hours, a gigantic creature emerges
  from the water, heading straight for the plane! This leviathan resembles a
  huge snake, several hundred feet long, with a gaping maw capable of
  swallowing the entire plane with ease.
</p>

<p>
  To make matters worse, the two blips on the radar accelerate and begin
  heading straight for <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> plane as well.
  When they are within visual range, it is clear they are U.S. military
  aircraft.
