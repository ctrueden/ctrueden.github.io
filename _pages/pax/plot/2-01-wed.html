<p>
  During the six months after the death and dismemberment of
  <a href="../npcs/sitruc.html">Sitruc</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a>, members of the "band" have gone their
  separate ways, occasionally staying in touch. Since then, Pax has been
  rebuilt. Roughly a third of the population has left Pax, deciding for various
  reasons that the strange goings on aren't worth being there.
</p>

<p>
  Worldwide, the organized monster attacks have ceased entirely. The creatures
  are still out there in the wild, occasionally making headlines with an attack
  or two. Things have seemed to fall back to normal.
</p>

<p>
  Anti-terrorism has been collapsing. Until the next election in 2036, Senate
  Majority Leader Morgan Russell has been confirmed as president. Many congress
  members are reversing their stances on outsourcing security and other vital
  functions to the corporate enterprises. Most responsibilities have been
  reverted back to governmental agencies.
</p>

<p>
  The war between China-India-Russia and the US-Europe has ended. Various
  political rife from before the war is returning back into lime-light of the
  world stage. It is rumored that a conflict in Asia is likely.
</p>

<h2>In local news</h2>

<em>
<p>
  The <a href="../groups/miracles.html">Pax Miracles</a>, who have been on
  hiatus, will have their first game tomorrow afternoon (January 1, 2034).
</p>

<p>
  Fireworks and light displays tonight at Pax above Masterson Park are
  expected to draw thousands as the city celebrates the reconstruction of the
  city. I'm sure <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck</a> is up there somewhere
  smiling down on the citizens of our fair town.
</p>

<p>
  With <a href="../pcs/buck.html">Buck's</a> sad death, Chuck Xavier is
  expected to win the mayor race early next year.
</p>
</em>

<h2>In world news</h2>

<em>
<p>
  The <a href="../groups/stratco.html">Strategic Improvements Corporation</a>
  court case determining ownership of the multi-trillion dollar corporation was
  settled out of court. The former board members have come to some sort of
  agreement. Former <a href="../groups/stratco.html">StratCo</a> Vice President
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Ingolf Rixmann</a> was named the new CEO.
</p>
</em>

<h2>Pre-session character developments</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>, now six months pregnant, continues to
  spread the word of <a href="../npcs/janell.html">Janell</a>. She plans to
  host the annual New Years gathering at the Garden as usual this year.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Moses Morningbird</a> has just moved to Pax two
  months ago, and has begun defending it from the forces of evil, while
  maintaining a mild-mannered secret identity.
</p>

<p>
  In his spare time, <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> has been attempting
  to unlock the powers of his mind, track down
  <a href="../npcs/pdk.html">PaleDeathKnight761</a>, and recruit an
  <a href="../groups/club.html">elite team of thieves</a>. Eight members have
  signed on, including an assassin called
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">"Carnivore"</a> and a hacker named
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">"Grimm."</a>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> traveled to the Himalayas, located
  the entrance into the <a href="../races/dwarves.html">dwarven</a> lands, and
  went to visit them. He learned that they had been at war with the
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a> for over a hundred years, and
  though their superior craftsmanship had kept the
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a> and their evil magic at bay in the
  past, the <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a> had invented thunderous
  tools that killed from afar, and were now winning the war. However, before
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald's</a> eyes, the tide of the war turns
  again, as a strange sickness spreads throughout the
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomish</a> peoples, caused by the magic they
  had harmlessly wielded for so long.
</p>

<h3>
  Session start: Friday, December 30, 2033 &ndash; evening PST
</h3>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> of a transport from Bakersfield to Pax
  Artificium happening tomorrow afternoon, carrying a large supply of cash
  reserves for First Pax Artificium Bank. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>
  organizes his <a href="../groups/club.html">group</a> to make a strike
  against the convoy. The next morning, <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>
  and his <a href="../groups/club.html">team</a> head to the desert to prepare
  their ambush.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../npcs/leo.html">General Leo</a> enlists
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> (who has recently returned from the
  <a href="../races/dwarves.html">dwarven</a> lands along with a
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnome</a> named
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a>) to take his squad to Bakersfield for an
  escort assignment. Their mission is to protect a convoy carrying valuable
  goods on its way to Pax Artificium.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Moses</a>, who works at a cafe often frequented
  by <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> and his men, overhears them
  talking about their upcoming mission. He gets an odd feeling that he may be
  needed there and decided to help guard the convoy covertly.
</p>

<p>
  That afternoon, <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> is making preparations
  for the night's festivities at the Garden when her two guardians,
  <a href="../npcs/sartus.html">Sartus</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/benek.html">Benek</a>, appear. "My lady," they warn, "Your
  friends are in danger. They have been deceived." The
  <a href="../races/elves.html">wraiths</a> offer to transport
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> to the scene if she wishes.
</p>

<p>
  In the desert, just as the <a href="../groups/club.html">team</a> is about to
  strike, the convoy suddenly vanishes as it is driving down the road.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> and his squad find themselves in an
  area with many trees. They swerve to avoid the obstacles and stop the
  vehicles.
</p>

<p>
  Getting out of the APCs, they are confronted with a
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">serene-looking woman</a> dressed in natural
  robes. "You will pay for your sins against
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a>, she announces as she raises her hand
  toward the squad. They scream as their hands and arms are torn from their
  bodies by an unseen force. Some of them even collapse as their hearts explode
  forth from their chests. All the organs float toward the
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">druid</a> then fall into a pile on the ground,
  which bursts into flames.
</p>

<p>
  Enraged, <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> charges the
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">woman</a>, but several pixies appear in the
  trees above and pepper him with arrows until he collapses into
  unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Moses</a> (as Speed Demon) following
  the convoy from further back, sees it disappear from the road ahead and moves
  to investigate. Flying in from above, he enters the grove as well, and his
  keen hearing enables him to hear the skirmish below. He is horrified when he
  sees the dead men from the squad.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> and her
  <a href="../races/elves.html">wraiths</a> appear next to
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, who tries to hide his surprise.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> explains that 
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> is walking into a trap. The
  <a href="../races/elves.html">wraiths</a> elaborate, saying that someone
  altered the <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> transport logs,
  faking today's transport.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> orders most of his team back to Los
  Angeles, but tells <a href="../npcs/lance.html">Lance Kodiak</a> to go to
  Bakersfield and track down <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>, who he
  suspects faked the transport log entry, and who has been reporting on the
  status of the caravan from Bakersfield.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Carnivore</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> drive toward the area where the convoy
  disappeared, and also find themselves suddenly in the strange grove. The
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">druid</a> appears once they get out of the car.
  "Defiler of nature," she says as she tears
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef's</a> hands from his body. He screams and
  lashes out with destructive magic, knocking the wind out of the
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">druid</a>.
