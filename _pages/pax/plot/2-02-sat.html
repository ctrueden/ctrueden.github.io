<h3>
  Session start: Saturday, December 31, 2033 – 2200 PST
</h3>

<p>
  In the alley behind Angels the massive dog (a little smaller than a cow)
  falls to the ground limp as a woman rolls onto the street from its jaws.
</p>

<p>
  BLAM! <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> shoots the woman directly through
  her forehead without any warning. Everyone turns startled as <a href="../npcs/raphael">the priest</a> yells
  out, "You fool! Killing
  her will only cause the loss of your friend. The stake through her heart has
  put her in torpor." <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> asks if the dog can safely be killed. <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a>
  says that is a good idea. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> shoots five bullets aiming at the dog's head
  and chest.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a> introduces himself as
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Raphael Douglas</a>, a Catholic priest who has
  traveled far to defeat the evil that has manifested itself in Pax. He tells
  us the woman and dog are demons from HELL!
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> asks whether
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> talks to God.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> asks whether
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> has ever spoken with God.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> thinks for a while and stammers out that
  he has heard the radio network of God.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> cuts
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> off shouting, "That is voice of SATAN!"
  There is some silence as we all continue to get a creepy vibe from this
  priest.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> breaks the silence asking how this demon
  came to be here. <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> tells us,
  "Evil wants to come and take the world. The demon's song affected only those
  who are touched, those that possess special unworldly powers. Several of
  these demons are infiltrating this city as I speak. Their den of evil is less
  than two hours."
</p>

<p>
  We in silence watch the creepy
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> rolls his eyes into his
  head for a few seconds. Breaking out of his trance he says, "Things are worse
  then I thought. Try your technology." <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>
  checks his phone and computer and no network is available.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> already knows things are not working.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a>s tells us that this is not
  localized to this city and he must seek out and resolve this problem.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> asks
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> whether
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> can be brought back.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a> wants assistance from us as
  payment for helping. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> immediately agrees
  to that.
</p>

<p>
  The discussion is then side tracked for a while on what happened.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a> tells us he destroyed the den
  of evil, but some the creature had already left. He followed them to Pax.
  These demons are likely in places where there are large crowds.
</p>

<p>
  The discussion changes again to how to fix the network outage.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> suggests, first checking
  various technologies and see if they work. Then determine what is wrong and
  correct it. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> leave the alley to pursue some solutions.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> returns back to the bar and sees the TV
  is out. Only test broadcast is playing. Some pre-recorded music TV plays back
  to calm the audience. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> hopes everything
  will be back by midnight.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> asks <a href="../npcs/mike">Mike</a>
  ("red shirt" employee at Angels) at the front door whether he can use the
  phone (<a href="../npcs/mike">Mike</a> says no).
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> asks where
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> is and Mike tells him he is in the
  backroom working with the sound system. On his way to the backroom,
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> runs into
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>, and they have a spat. She's
  fairly annoyed that <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> has left her by
  herself. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> responds with, "I have to meet
  with <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> in the back room."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> unimpressed and very annoyed
  retorts, "If you don't want to be here with me, just say so!"
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> calms
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> down and shows her that the
  network is down. <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> being a geek is
  intrigued and is now genuinely interested in pursuing this investigation with
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>. They go together to find
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> as she says, "I better not find out you
  arranged all of this to get out of this date."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>, <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> meet up and hypothesize that it is
  just wireless/satellite systems that are down. They talk with
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> at
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> on the landline. The most
  recent news being that <a href="../npcs/bishop">Bishop</a> loss his
  memory very recently and <a href="../pcs/pete">William Moss</a> is
  trying to help him.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> invites
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> to head to the top floor of
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> to investigate this further.
</p>

<p>
  Back in the alley, <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> tries to convince
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> that he has mystical abilities.
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> remains unconvinced.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a> tries to explain these
  realities to <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> begins to consider this might be a real
  possibility. <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> silently listens.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> come into the alley.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a> asks again if folks will
  promise to help <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> with these
  demons and the technology problems. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>
  agrees to help without making any promises to
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">the priest</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> turns to
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> and says he senses things in
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> that he knows about.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> looks concerned.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> is thinking internally that maybe the
  dog would be good eating and is personally horrified that he would even
  consider that (dogs are man's best friend)!
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> senses a darkness from
  within <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> steps back away from
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">the priest</a> and agrees to help
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> out.
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> is a little confused about what's
  going on, asking <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> for details.
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> decides to help by getting some pizzas for
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">the priest</a>. Only four pies are left!
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../art/2-02-sat-full.jpg">
  <img src="../art/2-02-sat-small.jpg" width="400" height="317"
    alt="The gang motors it to the church in a pizza delivery SUV">
  </a>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> go to
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> stays at the bar.
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a>, <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a>, and the woman in torpor
  drive to Saint Michaels in <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a>'s car&mdash;a
  pizza delivery SUV with its own oven in the back.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> shudders as he considers eating dog
  again. <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> tells us that he had
  mishap with his motorcycle today.
</p>

<p>
  Taking the side entrance into Saint Michaels we place the woman in torpor on
  small altar and <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> locks the
  doors. He opens his book and begins chanting in Latin. We watch the woman
  begins transforming into a whirlwind of particles and motes of light. The
  room fills with a feeling of magical backlash. It is just there, everywhere,
  nowhere specific. All the particles and motes of light reform into
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a>.
</p>

<p>
  No one is sure what to say, but <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a>
  breaks in wondering what the heck is going on. We fill
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> in on all that has happened.
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> decides to go with us to hunt
  more demons down and kick their asses.
</p>

<p>
  We leave to find <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel Miller</a> to see if he
  might be of any help. <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> goes to
  find the <a href="../groups/five">Fabulous Five</a> to kick some demon
  ass. We agree to meet at <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> HQ.
</p>

<p>
  In the car to <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> asks
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> what's going on.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> asks, "How much do you want to know?" She
  wants the truth. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> generally things are happening
  without being terribly specific. <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>
  very aware of this says, "You still haven't told me anything! You talk about
  'things' and 'stuff.'" <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> lamely replies,
  "Ask me what you want to know." <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>
  replies, "That's evasive," as they pull into
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a>'s parking lot.
</p>

<p>
  An the way up the elevator, <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> that we had a final confrontation
  with those responsible behind the attacks on Pax and the bombing.
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> sharply suggests they likely had
  friends and can't believe we just assumed that everything was taken cared of.
  The elevators door opens.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> checks the surveillance tapes to see if
  he can determine how the woman singer came in. She came through the front
  door while <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> was not working and walked
  straight to the stage. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> then checks with
  some regulars and employees to see if anyone has seen her before. No one
  knows who she is.
</p>

<p>
  Reviewing more surveillance tapes, the short guy simply appeared and
  disappeared on the tapes. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> checks a few
  other things and makes sure the party finishes out quietly.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a>, <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Raphael</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> go to
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel Miller's</a> apartment and then his
  university office. They are all frustrated that the network is down and that
  finding people is so hard.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> walking out of the elevator see
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> madly typing away.
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> says he's traced the interference to some
  source close by. He's devised a scheme to measure the amount of interference.
  The interference is a hundred times stronger than needed to disrupt all
  wireless communications.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> is sure this is not a natural phenomenon.
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> suggests it might be a terrorist
  attack. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> suggests maybe there many of
  these sources around the world. Using the "magical" network of sensors around
  the city, he believes he can narrow where the source of the interference is.
</p>

<p>
  As the three of them are working on this together,
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> notices the sensors are everywhere
  including private locations. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> lamely tries
  to defend this invasion of privacy.
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> wonders how everything was
  replaced after the bomb&mdash;especially personal one-of-a-kind items. She
  laments, "Buttons isn't buttons?" (referring to her teddy bear...)
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> notices that interference at
  higher altitudes is stronger. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> checks the
  computer and confirms. They localize it above the sensors, triangulating a
  mile or two above the city.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> and company get to the
  Garden (the city park owned by the
  <a href="../groups/janell">Way of Janell</a>), where there is a huge
  hippy-like crowd is celebrating New Years, giving out free food, prizes, etc.
  As we pull up we hear someone calming the crowd, telling them authorities are
  doing what they can and reassuring them to continue to enjoy the festivities.
</p>

<p>
  Talking to various folks we determine that
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> was speaking to everyone, when
  <a href="../npcs/marissa">a woman</a> began to sing and something
  happened. There was some kind of struggle, a
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">shorter man</a> stopped the singing and then a
  beast appeared. A <a href="../pcs/moses">spandex-clad figure</a>
  grappled with the dog, but no one seems to recall exactly what happened next,
  or where all these strange characters went.
</p>

<p>
  We go up and around the bend where the huge dog,
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">short man</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/marissa">singing woman</a> disappeared. Nothing is
  there. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> kneels down, closes his eyes,
  saying he wants to sense what happened. He meditates in silence for five
  seconds or so and starts retelling what happened.
</p>

<p>
  "I see <a href="../npcs/marissa">another beautiful woman</a> like the
  one we encountered walking to the microphone and singing. She entrances the
  crowd, except for <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>, who is standing
  nearby. <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> bursts forth from a cafe
  across the street, while a half-dozen folks walk forward towards
  <a href="../npcs/marissa">the woman</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> is concentrating and suddenly there is
  silence. All sorts of gun fire and fighting begin around
  <a href="../pcs/sara">the woman</a>. A
  <a href="../pcs/moses">man wearing spandex</a> with a large "SD" on his
  chest flying in the air lands in front of
  <a href="../npcs/marissa">the beautiful woman</a>. I see a huge dog
  appear out of nowhere. Some sort of fog rolls in, and everything becomes
  clouded. I can't see or hear anything anymore. I can't see anymore."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> finds the
  <a href="../npcs/winston">Winston</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles">Bubbles</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/toothy">Toothy</a> at the Fresh Cafe.
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> fills them in on what has been
  going on.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> calls the astronauts at the space
  station. <a href="../npcs/buckley">Commander Dick Buckley</a> is anxious
  to return to Earth. Their supplies are dwindling. They have also noticed the
  communications block out up in space and are happy to hear from base camp.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/buckley">Dick</a> determine that taking more
  measurements from the Lift a mile or two above ground might provide more
  information.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> uses the sensors to locate us at the
  park. Using the emergency communication holographic projection system, his
  head appears to us. He informs us of what he,
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a>, and Dick have discovered. He tells us to
  meet at the Lift. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> contacts
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> and the
  <a href="../groups/five">Fabulous Four</a> (
  <a href="../npcs/lefty">Lefty</a> is out of town somewhere) as well.
</p>

<p>
  The last group gets to the Lift by 0030 hours. We split up.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>, <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> board the lift. The rest will stay on the
  ground.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>'s head is pounding, nearly impossible to
  concentrate. He can barely remember why he is on the lift. He doesn't hear of
  notice as the Lift starts taking off at a hundred miles an hour.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> has a premonition that something is wrong.
  It feels as though he is being watched. He gets to the control room and
  shares his concern with <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> suggests it might just be the cameras.
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> says he feels like he's being watched and
  this is all a trap and it isn't because of the cameras.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> blows <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a>
  off.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> leaves and finds
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> explaining his strange
  spider sense acting up. <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a>
  tells him that it is nothing. <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> insists it is
  something more. <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> gets his
  Bible out and begins reading in Latin.
</p>

<p>
  Something bites the back of <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>'s neck.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> who is surprised. There are no
  bugs in Pax. Why would they be on the Lift?
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> checks
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>'s neck and sees a small welt.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> uses the system locate the
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Something bites the back of <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>'s neck.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>, wondering what the hell happened, looks
  around. The fabulous four and <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> are all
  concerned.
</p>

<p>
  Something bites the back of <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>'s neck. It
  barely registers with this pounding headache.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> uses his stethoscope to see if it can
  help with his head or the welt he feels on the back of his neck. It heals the
  welt completely. His head is clear for a moment and then more pain.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> stops reading Latin and
  scans the room. He points right behind where
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> is sitting saying there is a person right
  there. Two silenced gunshots strike
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> in the chest from the place
  where he was pointing.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> and the
  <a href="../groups/five">Fabulous Four</a> spread out taking a defensive
  posture. Once <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> is alone, he hears a
  woman's voice and a ripple in the air near him asking, "What are you doing
  here?" <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> walks towards the voice. She warns
  him to back off, and that there is a gun trained to his head.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> stumbles to
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> attending to the gunshot
  wound. Everyone else is on edge looking for whatever it was that shot
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> talking to the others find out
  about the invisible intruder on the Lift. They lock the door to the control
  room and begin to scan for anything unusual.
</p>

<p>
  The voice wants to know what <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> and his
  friends are trying to accomplish. They both try to get information from each
  other, but neither is sharing. The voice ends by telling
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> to stay where he is at or be shot.
  Looking carefully, <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> sees occasionally
  ripples in the air assuming that is her moving around.
</p>

<p>
  Working with the sensors, <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> locate that the network interference is
  localized at 7,000 feet. They slow the Lift to stop and find that the exact
  location seems to be fluctuating or moving around. They find no other unusual
  readings.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> is looking much better
  after <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> tends to the gunshot wounds.
  Everything is quiet as there is no sign of the intruder.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> to go to the front with his
  insurance card to fill out paperwork.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> sees that
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> is very confused begins drawing the
  mystical backlash from <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>'s head.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>'s mind clears up as the remaining wounds
  on <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> begin healing
  themselves.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> decides to tackle the invisible woman.
  She sighs in disappointment and shoots him. It has some sort of sleep effect,
  which <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> shrugs off and then grapples her.
  After some struggling, she collapses from the electric jolt of
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>'s brass knuckles.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> ties her up, finding and removing strange
  belt with a device attached to it. The woman becomes visible when the belt is
  removed. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> wears the belt and becomes
  invisible.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> points at something out the Lift
  window. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> pulls out his IR goggles and
  finds <a href="../npcs/bird">a bird</a> a hundred feet away. With
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>'s help we determine this very well
  might be the source of the network outage.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> leaves the control room, locking the door
  behind him. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> borrows the IR goggles to see
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> which is flying around the Lift. We
  discuss possible ways to get <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> tells us over the intercom that
  she's got bad news and more bad news. On the ground the others have
  encountered some an intruder. The other bad news is that someone is banging
  on her door.
</p>

<p>
  We all run to the control room just in time to see the door crash open. The
  invisible figure has hold of <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> and
  is threatening to shoot her is we do anything.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> can see with the goggles the figure
  holding a gun to <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> fires a gun and misses.
</p>

<p>
  The invisible figure shoots <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> chants some Latin and a
  glowing light surrounds our invisible foe so we can see him. Chaos ensues
  ending with the man pointing a gun to <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>'s
  head. <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> are able to persuade the man that we
  should all be calm and just talk it out. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>
  heals <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The man accuses that we are controlling the beasts that have been attacking
  the cities. We deny it. He says he knows we controlled creatures six months
  ago that attacked the army. He says he knows we are the cause of the wireless
  outage. We try to convince him we are not responsible. He yells for us to get
  out of the control room, but then gasps for air and falls to his knees.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> says, "It is done."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> finds a cell phone from the formerly
  invisible woman. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> writes down the various
  numbers stored in its memory.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> checks the invisible man and is relieved
  to find that the man is still alive. Rummaging through his equipment, he
  removes a box from the man's belt and the man becomes visible.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> determines that it is some sort of
  cloaking device.
</p>

<p>
  We come up with a plan to get <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> chants to bring
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> closer, straining and sweating
  profusely as his abilities aren't meant for this use.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> teleports
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> to him.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> grapples
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>, taking a bunch of damage.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">The priest</a> approaches
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> on his request for aiding with the
  backlash that he knows is coming. Before
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> can do anything,
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> teleports outside of the Lift to where
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> was and begins falling.
  <a href="../npcs/bird">The bird</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> fight. Eventually
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> knocks
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> out.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> is sure that
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> is fine using one of his devices to go
  somewhere safely.
</p>

<p>
  The lift returns to the ground. We all meet up together, except for
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> who is in
  <a href="../npcs/sitruc">Sitruc's</a> former Russian mansion.
</p>

<p>
  Interrogating the prisoners, we find out that they work for the government.
  They are trying to learn the source of these monsters and how to control
  them. We tell them our control over them was temporary and we can't do it
  again. <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> lashes out saying,
  "These creatures are all demons and all your research will do nothing." After
  some more interrogation, we don't learn much more as they aren't very
  cooperative.
</p>

<p>
  A SWAT team busts in through various windows and doors surrounding us as the
  session ends.
