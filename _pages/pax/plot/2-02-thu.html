<h3>
  Session start: Saturday, December 31, 2033 &ndash;
  afternoon PST &ndash; off the western U.S. coast
</h3>

<p>
  As the leviathan is about to swallow the plane, the creature suddenly screams
  as it is his by missiles fired from the two military aircraft. Severely
  wounded, the creature topples out of the sky, crashing against the ocean's
  surface and disappearing beneath.
</p>

<p>
  The military contacts <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> plane over the
  radio, demanding that they allow themselves to be escorted back to a nearby
  aircraft carrier. <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> attempt to decline, but the military
  personnel are insistent.
</p>

<p>
  After following the jets for a couple of minutes, the pilots mysteriously
  eject all of a sudden, and <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> chuckles.
  With nothing impeding them further, <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a>
  resumes his course for Canada.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> heads for the Canadian base northeast
  of Vancouver first, despite <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty's</a>
  objections and death threats. Once they land, however, the Canadians detain
  the entire plane, since it is filled with anomalous individuals.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> tries to take off, but the plane won't
  start for some reason. <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> makes a
  cryptic comment about it, and <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> is
  convinced that <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> is somehow responsible
  for both his nonworking plane and the bizarre ejections earlier.
</p>

<p>
  Weapons and other "sensitive items" are held in secure storage while they are
  at the base. They search <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty's</a> briefcase,
  finding nothing unusual. Just as they are about to hand it back,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> remarks, "I think you missed
  something," prompting the guards to search again. This time, they find the
  circlet hidden beneath the case's false bottom and confiscate the
  jewel-encrusted item, placing it in their vault.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> meets with his boss,
  <a href="../npcs/baxter">Baxter</a>, telling him what has happened with
  the leviathan. <a href="../npcs/baxter">Baxter</a> notes that anomalous
  individuals seem to be magnets for strange and troubling activity.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/baxter">Baxter</a> asks everyone to submit to some
  tests, but does allow <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> to leave when they decline.
  However, as they are heading back to the plane,
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson">deputy Frederickson</a> orders the guard
  escorting them to take them captive so that they can be experimented upon.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/baxter">Baxter</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> give
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> a tour of the facilities.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> are each given a physical to check up
  on their anomalous readings. They are then escorted back to the plane.
</p>

<p>
  A fellow scientist calls <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> to examine some
  intriguing findings while injecting <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> with certain chemicals.
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> releases the patients, claiming they had
  not volunteered for testing, although the scientist insists
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson">Frederickson</a> told him they had.
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson">Frederickson</a> then appears and
  implores <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> to reconsider his position. He
  says that these specimens are by far the best they've run across so far, and
  that missing this opportunity to study them would be a mistake.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> refuses to change his mind, and
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson">Frederickson</a> tries to shoot him, but
  misses pathetically, then runs away. <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a>
  calls a base-wide manhunt. After waiting by one of the exits for a few
  minutes, <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> receives a call from
  <a href="../npcs/baxter">Baxter</a> saying
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson">Frederickson</a> has been caught, and the
  alert ends.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> runs off, traumatized and
  angry. She wanders the corridors until she finds the hangar, sneaks up on the
  guard watching <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> near the plane, and knocks him
  unconscious. <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> eventually wanders back to
  the plane as well.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/baxter">Baxter</a> orders
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> to continue watching these anomalous
  individuals, gathering information as available and recording their
  experiences. <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> proceeds to the plane, and
  they all leave the base.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> flies them to an abandoned airstrip
  outside Vancouver. Unfortunately, as they are discussing what to do next, the
  wireless communications stop working, and none of them can use their phones
  or the Internet. The airstrip has only a nonworking payphone. Frustrated,
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> begins walking down the road toward the
  city.
</p>

<p>
  A Toyota drives toward them, with two Indian men inside. They pull up next to
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and ask her if she brought the item.
  She tells them that she does not have it. They seem disappointed. They then
  ask if <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel Miller</a> is nearby. She says
  he's down the road a ways. They proceed to the airstrip and introduce
  themselves to <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> as Professors Mishael
  Singh and Azariah Santhanam, saying they are big fans of his work, and have
  adapted the algorithm for digital audio. They speak of a prophecy that led
  them to tell their "employer" about an ancient circlet that needed to be kept
  from falling into the wrong hands, so that she would arrange to have it
  stolen from the museum.
</p>

<p>
  The Indian professors are of course unhappy to learn that the Canadian
  government has confiscated the circlet. But they suggest that
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> speak with their employer in any case.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> agrees, saying that she needs to return
  her advance pay, since she failed to deliver.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> ask about the flute, and the professors
  say that their employer mentioned an ancient flute that she was close to
  being able to obtain, and that perhaps they should come along as well to find
  out more.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> goes along as well, since that is his
  job, but nothing here really interests <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a>,
  and he bids them all farewell as he makes to leave in his little plane.
</p>

<p>
  And so it is that the strange Indian professors escort
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a>, <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> to meet with their mysterious
  employer in the city.
</p>
