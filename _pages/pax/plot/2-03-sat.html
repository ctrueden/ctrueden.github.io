<h3>
  Session start: Sunday, January 1, 2034 &ndash; 0200 PST
</h3>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> falls to the floor on
  <a href="../npcs/sitruc.html">Sitruc's</a> former castle in Russia relieved
  the teleport worked correctly. He takes a moment to recover, gets a beer, and
  unsuccessfully tries to contact the group. While relaxing and reading a book,
  he senses an increased capacity for magic within himself and attempts to
  magically enhance his ability to respond to situations.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> is very jittery making it hard to sleep.
  After some time he just falls to sleep when a two-foot man in ragged clothing
  prods <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> awake. "Who are you? What are you
  doing here? What are you? How did you get in here? Stand back!"
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> blurts out in rapid succession.
</p>

<p>
  The little man says, "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says the bad men
  have your friends. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> wants to save
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>."
</p>

<p>
  "Who took my friends? The <a href="../races/dwarves.html">dwarves</a>? The
  <a href="../races/elves.html">elves</a>?
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a>? Your one of those
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a>, aren't you? You took my friends,
  didn't you? How many points are you getting for this? You're
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>, aren't you?"
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> speaks rapidly.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> stands back a couple feet, freaked out
  by <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt's</a> reaction.
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> is not a
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnome</a>," with quiet disdain and disgust,
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> is a
  <a href="../races/halflings.html">halfling</a>. You are mad at
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>? <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>
  just wants to save <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>."
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> goes on to explain that his friends
  caused the communications outage and that his friends are not so nice.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> eventually accepts what
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> is saying and gathers his things
  together.
</p>

<p>
  The SWAT team consists of thirteen people who in a blur surround the group
  with weapons trained. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> quickly slips the
  cloaking device on himself and fades from view. Everyone else puts his or her
  hands up surrendering. <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> moves next
  to <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> showing confusion and fear in her
  eyes.
</p>

<p>
  One SWAT team member charges through the crowd, weapon firing somewhere near
  where <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> was. A dart hits something and
  fades from view. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks what is going on.
  The <a href="../npcs/grey.html">person</a> that shot
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> tells the group, "If you surrender
  peacefully, none of you will be harmed," as she reaches and takes the
  cloaking device from <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>, making his slumping
  body visible.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> faking that he has passed out
  unsuccessfully, tries to grapple <a href="../npcs/grey.html">the woman</a>.
  She glares at <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> briefly as he winces in
  agony, his mind exploding with hot searing pain.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">The woman's</a> voice speaks in his head: "You
  are outmatched&mdash;give up." A she turns her back and walks to the pair of
  operatives our group captured, <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> tries to
  grab her again, but some invisible force is holding his arms back.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">The woman</a>, completely ignoring
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack's</a> attempt, shoots and kills the prisoners
  saying, "Let this be a lesson to any who would try and fail."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">The woman</a> takes off her mask, showing her
  long, auburn hair, orange eyes, and pale skin (not freakishly white).
  Everyone allows themselves to be handcuffed (even
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the unconscious bird</a>) and are placing in
  vans. <a href="../npcs/bubbles.html">Bubbles</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/toothy.html">Toothy</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/winston.html">Winston</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> are put together in one van.
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> in put in a van by itself. The rest
  are put in the van where <a href="../npcs/grey.html">the woman</a> gets in
  the passenger seat.
</p>

<p>
  "Take me to them," <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>
  looks confused, saying he can't do that. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  glares at <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> and wants to know where his
  friends are. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says he doesn't know and
  can't help. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> begins to grill
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>, when
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says,
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> is about to be found,
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> has to go," and he fades out.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, using Libra, tries to contact
  <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Zuul</a> with no luck.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> then checks to see whether Libra can mess
  with the vehicle. Nothing seems to work with the communications outage.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Raphael</a> is gloomy as the van drives
  through Pax's north gate. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> starts talking
  boring mundane drivel, trying to get a rise out of the driver through the
  security glass, saying things like, "I need to get back to Pax. My car is
  there. I can make you pizza."
</p>

<p>
  The driver speaks through a speaker, "Will the prisoner please refrain from
  talking." The woman gives the driver a glare.
</p>

<p>
  The vans turn off the dessert road leading to an airstrip with a military
  transport plane on the runway. Five more men come out of the hangar. The van
  doors open and the SWAT folks tell everyone to get out of the van.
</p>

<p>
  "Holy Shit! <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>, come over quick,"
  says the member that opens the other van where the
  <a href="../groups/five.html">Fabulous Four</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> were held captive.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> hears in the distance that the others
  are gone. Disgruntled, <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> gets the
  remaining prisoners on the plane.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>, realizing there is nothing else he can
  do until morning, sets his alarm clock and gets to sleep.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> notices a little black "X" logo on all the
  uniforms, which are nearly impossible to notice unless you are looking for
  them. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> points it out to the rest of the
  group. After an hour of flying, the guard suddenly fires at
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>, but misses. He then blasts
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> in the chest. (The guard seems as
  surprised to be taking these actions as everyone around him is.)
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Grey</a> yells, "What are you doing? The
  prisoners are not to be harmed! Put down your weapon." She looks over to
  everyone, "I don't know which one of you did that." 
</p>

<p>
  "He did it." <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> looks over to the guard.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>: "He was well trained." Pointing
  to <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Raphael</a>, "You did it, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Raphael</a>: "Maybe," sarcastically.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> seems irritated. A medic comes in
  to treat the party. The rest of the flight is uneventful as the plane lands.
  They are escorted out into some sort of valley with mountains in the distance
  at a larger military compound consisting of several buildings. Before anyone
  can get a clear layout they are rushing into a nearby building.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> are put into one cell with a sliding glass
  door. <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> he is to be questioned
  first and is lead somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> notices an area in the cell where the air
  is distorted. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> appears telling the group
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> informed their blonde haired friend
  about their blight. The group wants <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> to
  help them get out, but <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> can't do that. 
</p>

<p>
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says the bird is not from here. It is
  from far, far away. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> friends brought it
  here. They want to hurt people. They would hurt
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> if they knew
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> was here.
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> friends couldn't control
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> will go home is ordered to do so."
</p>

<p>
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> friends don't like
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a>.
  <a href="../races/humans.html">Humans</a> hurt
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a>. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>
  knows that isn't <a href="../races/humans.html">humans'</a> fault.
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a> is just sick and she needs time to heal
  and feel better. Friends blames the
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a>."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> says,
  "<a href="../races/humans.html">Humans</a> aren't to blame. Maybe it was the
  <a href="../races/elves.html">elves</a>,
  <a href="../races/dwarves.html">dwarves</a>, or something else?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> whispers to
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>
  doesn't think it is the <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> either,
  they just want someone to blame."
</p>

<p>
  "How about the <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a>? Maybe it was the
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a>," responds
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "Not the <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnomes</a>," says
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
  "Where are you from?" asks <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
</p>

<p>
  "Town no longer exists. All the people disappeared and then the village was
  abandoned. Oh no, <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> has been found.
  Aaaaahhhh," <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> begins to choke and then
  fades away.
</p>

<p>
  "Who the hell was that?" asks the guard.
</p>

<p>
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>," retorts
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "Shut up, smart ass," the guard rolls his eyes and goes back to his post.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt's</a> alarm clock goes off. Getting up and
  his things together, he zips to Seattle. Gets some coffee from Starbucks.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> returns to the cell with
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a>. He's sporting a busted
  lip, a black eye, and various bruises.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey's</a> expressions show signs of being
  shaken. He is thrown in the cell. <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>
  points to <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> saying they are next. The two get up and go
  with <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>,
  "She tried to use her witchery, but God protects me. She has some sort of
  mental abilities, but they are pathetic and weak. She was frustrated and
  resorted to physical violence. They asked questions that clearly show they
  have no idea what is going on."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  tell him about <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> visit and all he told
  them. <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> informs us, "All that
  demon spoke were lies. He was probably was punished for some failure in their
  plans of deception."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks whether the church has other priests
  like him. <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> responds, "There
  are no other priests like me." He goes on to speak of the demons, saying,
  "<a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> is one of them. It is their spawn.
  I know it. I feel it."
</p>

<p>
  In a white room with a single table, <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> are seated across from
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> wants information on
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> and their involvement with the
  others.
<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> tells her that they think that it is
  the source of the communications outage.
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> is cold, not like a normal bird.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> tells folks that he met the others in
  a bar last night.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> says he delivered pizza and was just
  curious so he went along.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> nods accepting what
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> and <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  are telling her. She points some device at each of them saying, "Just like I
  thought. You are both anomalies. This is usually associated with strange
  events and occurrences."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> then starts in on all sorts of weird things
  that have happened since he met with this lot at the bar.
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>, dogs that disappear and reappear,
  people turning into dust, invisible people, and all sorts of unbelievable
  things. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> fills in with some other
  events that are have no good explanations.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> nods and tells
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> and <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  that she sees that they are being honest and apologies for the necessity of
  the situation. She tells them the individuals they ran into are not to be
  trusted. Findings show that they are involved the events six months ago. It
  is known they were directly in control of monsters&mdash;the same ones that
  were attacking cities.
</p>

<p>
  She calls a guard to lead them to the mess hall for some hot meals. The guard
  is wearing a military outfit with U.S. flag.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> asks for some new clothes.
</p>
 
<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> accepts God's protection from
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> puts his hand on
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam's</a> head and begins chanting, followed by a
  prayer for God's strength on protection from the evils of this world.
  Throughout the prayer <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> feels what seems
  like raw mystic backlash wash over his body.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is leery internally searching for some
  horrible effect, but nothing happens.
</p>

<p>
  A little while later, <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> comes back
  telling <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> that
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">the general</a> wants to speak to them. They
  follow <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> to an office, where
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">60-year-old man in a military uniform</a> is
  smoking a cigar. He quotes off some demographics on
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>,
  using their names and recapping some of their recent activities. Slamming
  down some torn bits of paper he states, "I've been following your escapades
  for some time now. Tell me about these."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> looks at the scraps of paper stating it
  looks like a torn up treasure map. The map has some landmasses he has never
  seen before. He has no idea what they are and has never seen these before.
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> looks over to
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and asks what he knows.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> seems distracted, distant, staring off
  into space. <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> asks again and
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> takes notice, saying he doesn't know what
  the papers are. 
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> chimes in, "You could have talked with
  the two you sent after us if they weren't killed."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> responds, "Their knowledge was
  of no use. Damned failures. Couldn't do a simple mission of watching you
  guys."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> has
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> carefully examine the torn papers.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> then says the monsters were saved in the
  paper and when they tore it they were released.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> quickly asks, "How can you
  store monsters in a piece of paper?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>
  shrug saying they have no idea. <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>
  thinks in her head, "Special Origami techniques."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> is upset and doesn't believe
  it. <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> acknowledges they are telling
  the truth and he may have misjudged them.
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> is mad yelling out "I doubt it.
  I know they are bad apples." He takes a device out and points at the torn
  pieces of paper showing the display to <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, "See? Look! The readings are off the
  scale!" <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> is startled that he is
  displaying it to <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is very interested and asks what the
  device does. <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> says it measures
  anomalous activity (Oz keeps getting images of the thing from Ghostbusters).
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> starts talking about ideas and theories
  of how this might work and states he's very interested and offers
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">the general</a> his technical expertise.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> continues to not pay attention and
  clearly his thoughts are somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> then has
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>
  tell him about how the others escaped from the other van.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  state they have no idea and <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> gives
  a confirming nod.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">The general</a> thinks about it and decides
  perhaps he was being hasty in his judgment. He orders
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> to take
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> to work with the scientists.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> is about to protest and
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">the general</a> tells her, "Do it."
</p>

<p>
  As <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> walks into the Starbucks bathroom
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> is standing there with bruises on his
  face. "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says your friends need help."
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> tells him it can wait a minute or two and
  attempts to treat <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> injuries with
  mystic magic. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> leaps back and howls in
  bad, "Bad magic. It hurts. <a href="../races/humans.html">Human</a> magic
  bad. That's why <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> friends blame
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> for
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia's</a> pain."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> looks at
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> with a confused look. Snapping out of
  it, he asks <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> where his friends are.
</p>

<p>
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> will go find out where they are," says
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> as he fades away.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> is given a black uniform that fits
  much better. It appears to <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> that
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> has visibly grown in the last few
  hours.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> indicates he's not hungry and just wants
  to get some sleep. He is led back to the cell. The priest is already
  sleeping, so <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> just goes to sleep as well.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is led to another building with lots of
  equipment. Along the way, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks whether
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> is an anomaly. She says that their
  scientists have unlocked the genetic secrets of the monsters, and that she
  has been genetically engineered with their abilities. She says it was an
  honor to become among the elite.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">A scientist</a> comes up asking what the hell is
  going on. She tells him she was ordered to bring
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> to help out. He shrugs and extends his
  hand out to <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, "My name is
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a>. I am the head of the research
  into the creatures." <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> notes that his hand
  feels sandy and is scaly.
</p>

<p>
  "A fellow researcher has identified two types of anomalies. Type As are
  chemically different, having high levels of midichlorians (really some other
  chemical compound, but still the same lame Star Wars premise). Type Bs are
  genetically different from humans. Some type Bs have high levels of
  midichlorians, which are type AB."
</p>

<p>
  "Pax seems to have the most number of these anomalies. We know of fifteen in
  Pax. There aren't that many in New York and L.A. combined."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is more concerned with type Bs than type
  As. <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a> agrees and doesn't trust
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>, despite how sentient he seems now.
  He could develop into a monster.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a> goes on to tell
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> he is imbued with shocker lizards DNA.
  While <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey's</a> abilities is from a unique
  creature whose procedure is nearly impossible to duplicate. Her eyes are a
  side effect of the procedure. 
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> nods saying her vision has
  changed. All the colors she sees have changed.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tells them that he has seen similar
  experiments at <a href="../groups/stratco.html">StratCo</a>. He witnessed
  genetic experiments on creatures being done there.
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> drone on about details.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> and <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>
  enter the mess hall in another building for some food.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> gets the roast beef with Yorkshire pudding,
  while <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> gets tagliolini with smoked
  salmon. [GM's note: Yeah, riiight...]
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> climbing up the bunk wakes up
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>
  says, "Shhhh, there's a mad man down there," gesturing to the priest, "Do you
  know where this is?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> doesn't have any idea.
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> is frustrated, but says he'll go figure
  it out. He jumps down and runs through transparent door.
</p>

<p>
  A door then opens. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a> look, but no one is there. Then
  they notice <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> walking towards them.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> glares at him.
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a> is concerned.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> reassures them he is not dangerous. They
  scan him, but no one is there. <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> wants to
  know where they are, but is told it is classified.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> says, "Sorry, I can't help."
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> squeals in frustration.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> asks why he is so insistent.
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says,
  "<a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> wants to help his friends," pointing to
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> his friends can't come here and goes to
  take a hold of <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> then contorts as the air shimmers around
  him. His body contorts and stretches into an impish monster, leaping at
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> dodges out of the way and pulls
  out her gun and shoots <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>. The bullet and
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> disappear.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> suggests they check for residual
  anomalous activity. 
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> and <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  are brought back to the cells. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> is now
  wearing one of those uniforms. They both lie down and get some rest.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> sits around Starbucks until noon and then
  teleports to Pax. Asking the guards in <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid's</a>
  mansion reveals that no one knows where <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Zuul</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Dr. Arthur</a>, or any of his companions are.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> goes to
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> headquarters and checks the
  surveilance logs. <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Zuul</a> just disappears in the
  control room from one frame to the next. Looking at it again, it seems the
  sensor logs were altered. Concentrating on the room,
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> sees the room swirl and then sees
  <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Zuul</a> being clubbed from behind by a
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> guard, who then works with the
  computer and alters it to globally delete ten minutes from all cameras.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> catches the name
  <a href="../npcs/patrick.html">Robert Patrick</a> on his security badge.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> gets up not being able to sleep after
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo's</a> appearance and then running off. He
  sees <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> are here resting.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> then falls off the bed and isn't moving.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> checks <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  who is alive, but is unresponsive.
</p>

<p>
  "No residual anomalous activity showing," says
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>,
  disappointed, decides they should go investigate
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> instead. They walk over to another
  lab. <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Agent Draz</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> that this creature is emitting strong
  anomalous readings and various energy waves. It is quite likely
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">this bird</a> is causing the wireless outage and
  that it is strong enough to affect the entire world.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> suddenly awakes, seeing
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> staring at him. Startled,
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> exclaims, "Baa Dweam." His voice sounds
  funny as his tongue is swollen and somehow seems less competent.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> that it was no dream and that he needs to
  be careful with his abilities. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> is doubtful,
  but recounts his dream:
</p>

</em>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> continues to search the security logs
  from indications of where any of his companions might be.
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a> was at
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> headquarters at 2215 hours and
  then appeared to use his mystic ability to teleport away.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> was walking on the streets and
  stumbled and fell asleep in some bushes. After a few hours he got up and went
  inside an apartment building to a flat registered to one
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica Banyon</a>, who answers the door. Inside
  there is <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">a man in a business suit</a> and carrying
  a briefcase. After much discussion, the three of them take a car and leave
  the city.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> then reviews the capture of his friends
  again and notices <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> in the shadows
  watching the entire SWAT debacle, until the vans exit through the north gate.
  She then skates around the edge of the city, seemingly aimlessly. She then
  sees <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>, who is getting off a bus. They
  meet up and <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> all that she saw and that she was
  outnumbered and couldn't do anything. She needs to find her friends so that
  they can help her mom, who is sick and might be going crazy.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> says his friends are in L.A. right
  now. She says she can take the two of them to L.A. She skates fifty feet back
  and zooms at <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>. As she runs into him
  going very fast, they both disappear in a whirl of colors.
</p>
 
<p>
  Researching <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> determines it is something intrinsic
  about <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> that causes the interference.
  It is type B, with some sort of mystic enhancement cast on it. When
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> wakes up occasionally,
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> can sense
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> is intelligent.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> agrees, but says its mind is alien
  and doesn't make any sense.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone in the cell goes back to resting. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  decides that he wants to try leaving his body again. After an hour of
  concentrating, he feels his body back in the air duct.
</p>

<p>
  Thud! <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> sees
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee's</a> body fall off the bed again.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> seems to be barely alive.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> convinces the guard to send a medic
  to examine <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>, although the guard is extremely
  paranoid it is a bad ploy to escape.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> is in the air duct again. Looking at his
  body, it is ghost like. Gliding through the ducts, he comes across
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> doing research on
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. Further down, he sees a couple of
  guards playing cards. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> floats through the
  air duct. A guard looks up directly at him and starts to yell some expletive,
  but he is then drawn back to his body.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> decides to head to L.A.. He initially
  wants to take the Pelican, but it is under repairs. A bodyguard, Private
  Burby, is assigned to him and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> takes some
  sort of official Pax vehicle that can handle dessert conditions and still
  maintain over a hundred miles per hour on the road. Dressed in military garb,
  the two speed out toward L.A.
</p>

<p>
  The medic begins examining <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> when he gasps
  and sits up. His face is all scrunched up and his voice is sort of shrill
  with his tongue has swelled to the point where
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> can barely keep his mouth closed.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">The priest</a> warns
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> again that he needs to be careful, then
  puts out his hand. Blackness gets sucked out of
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> and heals
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">the priest's</a> wounds. The medic is freaked
  out and leaves, saying he has to report this.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> reports what he saw. Everyone goes back to
  sleep.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is the first to get up and asks for some
  food. He is led to the mess hall. On the way, he surveys the security
  details. While waiting in line for food, <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>
  overhears a conversation:
</p>

<p>
  "Doug, how long have you been living in Colorado?"
</p>

<p>
  "Shut up, you know we're not supposed to talk about anything personal."
</p>

<p>
  The two look anxiously at <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>, who is acting
  oblivious to what is going on. The two shrug and continue talking about
  something else. After eating, <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is told he
  is being brought to the lab.
</p>

<p>
  On the way there, outside between buildings,
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> makes a break for it running towards some
  vehicles in the distance. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> is shot at
  multiple times by varies guards. A couple strike him, but he gets to the jeep
  and is able to get it started using a screwdriver he finds in the glove
  compartment.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> runs over one of the guards and is struck
  by another bullet from altitude, presumably snipers on the rooftops.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> drives into the cover of building and
  then crashes through a fence onto the open road.
</p>

<p>
  Racing down the highway at 120 mph, <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> zips
  past a vehicle. In it is <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">some unknown person</a> driving towards him.
