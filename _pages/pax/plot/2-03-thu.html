<h3>
  Session start: Saturday, December 31, 2033 &ndash;
  2200 PST &ndash; outside Vancouver, BC
</h3>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> discovers his plane will not take off.
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> is convinced
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> is responsible. Despite his anger,
  however, <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> decides to chill in his plane
  for a while. But as he waits, he begins to feel uncomfortable, with a
  tightness in his chest. It feels as though something is pulling him toward
  the city.
</p>

<p>
  In the car, the strange Indian professors are escorting
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>, <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> to meet with their employer, who may
  know what has become of <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica's</a> flute. As the
  car gets further from the plane, though,
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> begins to feel uncomfortable, with a
  tightness in her chest, just like <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> is
  feeling. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> feels as though an invisible
  rubber band is being stretched between her and the plane. After a while, she
  can't stand it anymore and asks the car to pull over so that she can throw
  up. She tells the car to continue on without her and makes her way on foot
  back to the plane.
</p>

<p>
  As she gets closer, both <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> feel less tense, until they feel
  perfectly fine when <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> is standing outside
  the door to the plane. She knocks, and <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a>
  lets her in. They proceed to irritate the hell out of each other for the next
  several hours.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, late into the night, <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a>
  leaves, hopping on his motorcycle and heading down the road toward the city.
  Again, he feels the rubber band begin to stretch, but he is intent on
  breaking its hold over him. He cranks the throttle, and eventually his vision
  begins to go black, his body goes numb and he passes out. Miraculously, he is
  not killed instantly. But he is lying in the ditch, possibly bleeding to
  death, and his motorcycle is a twisted wreck.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> chats it up with the
  professors, discussing their respective research. The professors tell
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> that they have adapted his algorithm
  from plain text to function with aural media.
</p>

<p>
  They proceed to a single-story ramshackle building that is not in the best of
  neighborhoods. Inside, the building is just as dilapidated. They are led down
  a hallway into a back room. Surprisingly, this room is well-furnished, even
  luxurious. A woman sitting behind a fine oak writing desk stands up and
  introduces herself as <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia Zelakov</a>.
</p>

<p>
  She briefly discusses the state of affairs, stating that she has taken great
  pains to arrange for the acquisition of an ancient flute, which may or may
  not be the one <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> lost.
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> says she will stop by the
  professors' lodgings later that night and bring the flute so that
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> can examine it at that time.
</p>

<p>
  The professors then escort the party back to their room, a cheap motel a few
  miles away. They have a bunch of computer equipment inside, and once again
  begin talking about the prophecy they recently uncovered. They play it aloud
  for <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>:
</p>

<em>
<p>
  *crackling noises* *incomprehensible muttering* (deep male voice) What
  Babylon's Horn summons... *crackle* only Nebuchadnezzar's Crown can
  control... *muttering* (another voice, female, soft-spoken) If the Crown
  falls into shadow, *crackling* world set aflame. *crackle crackle*
  (androgynous voice) Foremost among wise men, mentor to those who first
  listen, yet a stranger *blip* accompanies the one who may possess the Crown
  *boop beep* place where the land once met the skies *kkk* seven roads meet.
</p>
</em>

<p>
  Later that night, <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> arrives, and she
  has brought the flute. She allows <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> to
  take a look at it. Though <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> was
  previously unaware of its true nature as a shapeshifting instrument, she can
  sense that it is her familiar flute all the same.
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> makes an offer to
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a>: if
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> agrees to recover the circlet from the
  Canadian base and bring it to her, <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a>
  will return to flute immediately. <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a>
  quickly agrees.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> then asks to speak with
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> in private. She reveals to him that
  she is actually his old friend <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>,
  explaining that although it can be annoying to maintain an alternate persona,
  people just don't take someone who looks like a child seriously.
</p>

<p>
  After that, <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> leaves. A few minutes
  later, there is another knock on the door. This time, it is a handsome man
  who <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> recognizes as
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, although he is not wearing his
  trademark sunglasses, and he is accompanied by two muscle-bound men in
  wife-beater tank tops and military cargo pants.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/josef.html">Josef</a> moves to step inside, and too late,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> recognizes the mottled skin
  complexion of the muscley men as those infected with the
  <a href="../npcs/healer.html">Great Healer's</a> plague. The
  <a href="../npcs/josef.html">man who looks like Josef</a> clenches his clawed
  hand as he utters a word of terrible power.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone within the motel room is affected, some more than others. One of the
  Indian professors falls down dead on the spot, while
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> and the other fall to the ground,
  unable to move. <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> fires his arm cannon at
  the man, but the rounds bend around him, deflected by an invisible force.
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> panics, too scared to fire again.
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> runs out the door and hides behind a
  car. Even though <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> can't move, he
  wields mystic energies, placing a shield around the surviving professor.
  <a href="../npcs/josef.html">Josef</a> calls forth a dark aura that surrounds
  him and his thugs, then gestures toward the shielded professor. The aura is
  discharged, but cancels out <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel's</a> shield
  as well. The thugs then beat the professor to death.
</p>

<p>
  Apparently satisfied that his task is complete,
  <a href="../npcs/josef.html">Josef</a> leaves the motel room. He sees
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> hiding behind the car, and
  remarks that she has made a wise decision. She hears him speak quietly as
  though to someone else, and catches a glimpse of him with a
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">fourth individual</a>, probably the most
  compellingly gorgeous man she has ever seen, dressed in a well-tailored suit
  and carrying an elegant walking stick. He swishes the staff through the air
  gracefully, somehow cutting a hole in reality itself. She observes as the
  four men step through the gateway, which then seals behind them.
</p>

<p>
  After the party recovers from their shock, they agree it is time to be
  leaving. Taking the professors' car, they quickly drive back to the plane at
  the abandoned airstrip outside the city. On the way there, they see another
  car pulled over at the side of the road, along with an ambulance with lights
  flashing.
</p>

<p>
  Stopping to investigate, they find a medic lifting
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> unconscious, bleeding body onto a
  stretcher. <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> tells the medic that they
  know this man, and <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> tells the medic to
  stand aside while he administers treatment, and proceeds to channel mystical
  healing energies into <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> body. As his
  wounds knit, the medic stares in disbelief, then stammers something about how
  they clearly have the situation under control, he's not needed there anymore,
  and he'll be leaving now.
</p>

<p>
  As <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> is brought closer to the plane, he
  regains consciousness, asking what happened. He insists they return to pick
  up his motorcycle, wreck or no. When the return to the crash scene,
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> passes out again. Since the motorcycle
  is in multiple pieces, they manage to fit it in the trunk.
</p>

<p>
  Back at the plane, <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> doesn't believe it
  when <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> insists that their wellbeing is
  now somehow dependent on their proximity to one another. He demands that they
  take the car away from the plane to demonstrate.
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> goes along and watches the odometer,
  determining they lose consciousness when approximately 2.3 miles from each
  other. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> is horrified but finally
  acknowledges the phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
  For some unknown reason, <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> plane is now
  working again. They take off and begin heading back to the Canadian base.
</p>
