<h3>
  Session start: Sunday, January 1, 2034 &ndash;
  0345 PST &ndash; outside Vancouver, BC
</h3>

<p>
  Tired from their ordeal, they sleep, except
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a>, who feels infused with energy for some
  reason. <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> notices his plane has more than
  half a tank of fuel&mdash;quite a bit more than it should have, given how far
  he's flown. The plane seems to be running at peak efficiency&mdash;perhaps
  even slightly better than peak.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> cranks the music so loud that no one
  can sleep. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> continuously washes her
  hands with her personal supply of wet wipes.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> tries to hack into the plane and shut
  off the tape deck using the Zodiacs, but the plane seems to resist his
  efforts somehow. <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> hypothesizes that
  the plane may have developed some sort of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> ports the tape outside the plane, and
  the music stops. But the backlash ports Cancer outside the plane as well, and
  both objects instantly plummet away from the plane, down to the Canadian
  wilderness below. <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> tries to hack into
  the plane again, and after a while, the plane's error messages start printing
  things like, "Stop it, that's annoying."
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> has a conversation with the plane,
  and tries to convince it to land. It tells him it won't cooperate unless it's
  okay with <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>, <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> argue about whether to turn the
  plane around, but <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> ignores them all and
  continues toward the base. <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> he has five seconds to open the steel
  door to the cockpit, and <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> ignores him.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> uses destruction magic to burn a
  large hole in the door. The backlash causes his left pinky finger to
  disintegrate, and blood gushes forth. He uses the nearby first aid kit to
  staunch the bleeding.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> attempts to convince
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> to land the plane using mind control
  magic, but it doesn't work. <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> both point guns at
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> until he backs down. For the rest of
  the trip, <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> discusses the wireless
  jamming effect with Gemini.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> lands the plane at the base. Eight
  armed guards surround them. <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> immediately
  kicks everyone off the plane. The guards search everyone and confiscate their
  weapons. <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> demands that
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> fix whatever is connecting him to
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>, saying, "Lock her up if you have to,
  but turn this shit off."
</p>

<p>
  They are escorted to <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter's</a> office, where
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> finds out that Roberts was the lead
  scientist who had experimented on <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> against their will. But it's five in
  the morning, and Roberts isn't in to work yet today. They walk over to the
  lab where Roberts had experimented on <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> examines Roberts's notes and discovers
  that a mixture known as Substance P was injected into them and caused a
  profound anomalous reaction, with nearby items levitating of their own
  accord. But <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> does not know what is causing
  the "rubber band" effect. He wants to perform more tests, but
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> opposes this idea.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> wants to go fix his motorcycle, as well
  as the door to the cockpit on the plane.
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> orders a guard to escort
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> to the machine shop. The party argues
  amongst themselves for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> suggests a guard be placed on
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> at all times.
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> orders the remaining guardsman to do
  that job. Everyone except <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> turns in for
  the night. <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> pulls his plane into the
  machine shop hangar and begins to repair it, but notices that the door and
  the motorcycle seem to be less damaged than last time he checked. After
  fixing the hole in the door, he installs leg and arm restraints. It is around
  1300 hours when he finishes the work.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> studies some materials from the plane and
  determines they exhibit a moderate level of anomalous readings. He also takes
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> to the doctor since
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> arm feels broken, and
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty's</a> arm aches as well. The doctor says it
  is indeed broken, probably within the last few hours, and that
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty's</a> arm is fine. The doctor puts the arm
  in a cast.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> retrieves her circlet, but since it
  doesn't give <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> a headache when he looks
  at it, he insists it isn't the same object.
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>, <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> go to
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter's</a> office to ask for his assistance.
  He agrees to go with them to the vault area and check the computer records
  for access logs. They determine that <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a>
  himself accessed the vault a few hours ago, but he denies it.
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> accuses him of lying, and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> uses mind control magic, commanding
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> to return the real circlet to them.
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> falls for it and orders the guards
  to stand aside as he woodenly leads them down a series of hallways to a
  high-security laboratory.
</p>

<p>
  Inside, the party sees <a href="../npcs/frederickson.html">Frederickson</a>
  studying a large jewel under a microscope.
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson.html">Frederickson</a> that they will be
  returning the gem to them. "Like hell we will!" says
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson.html">Frederickson</a> as he pulls his gun.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> takes down
  <a href="../npcs/frederickson.html">Frederickson</a> with one solid blow of
  pyrotechnics. <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> snaps out of his haze
  and tells the party that he can't let them take the jewel.
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> sprays
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> with pepper spray and he drops his
  gun.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> explains the situation, saying that
  he ordered <a href="../npcs/frederickson.html">Frederickson</a> to study
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>, as well as the gem, because he
  believes that anomalous individuals are too dangerous to be running around
  unchecked. Reluctantly, <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a> agrees to
  let them leave with the jewel. <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> orders
  some of his subordinates to report <a href="../npcs/baxter.html">Baxter</a>
  and <a href="../npcs/frederickson.html">Frederickson's</a> shady behavior to
  the higher-ups.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> takes the jewel, as well as a chicken
  egg, a hairpin, three pairs of sunglasses, a black t-shirt, a shoelace, five
  paperclips, and a cell phone from the laboratory along with the jewel.
</p>

<p>
  The party makes their way back to Vancouver, landing at a different airstrip.
  They steal a jeep from sleeping guy's garage, but realize they can't leave
  the plane there for the guy to find when he wakes up. They move the plane to
  a third, safer airstrip, and take the jeep into the city, to the building
  where they met <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> last time.
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia's</a> study, they see her sitting
  at her desk, but they sense she is anxious. When they all enter the room, a
  dozen pixies appear from various corners and sitting on the desk, and have
  bows trained on both <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> and the
  party. "Hand over the circlet," they demand, "and the flute, too!"
