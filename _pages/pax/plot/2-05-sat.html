  Session start: Sunday, January 1, 2034 &ndash; afternoon PST/MST
</h3>

<h2><a href="../pcs/jack">Jack's</a> Escape</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack's</a> heart pounds as the jeep tears through
  the barbed wire fence, catching his shirt and slashing it open, but luckily
  not catching his flesh. Taking the only road from the base leads him through
  farmland. Behind him, the whirling sounds of a helicopter indicate pursuit.
  <i>Ting, ting, ting</i>&mdash;a volley of bullets strike the jeep.
</p>

<p>
  <i>K-thunk, rumble, rumble.</i> "Oh shit,"
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> thinks to himself as he initially thinks
  that a tire has been shot out. Instead, he is no longer driving on a road,
  but on bumpy rough ground. The sound of the helicopter and its machine guns
  are gone. The mountains, sky and hills are replaced with tall trees with grey
  ooze where the leaves should be. All around in the distance are gigantic
  spider webs. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> stares for a second in
  shock.
</p>

<p>
  Looking back, he sees a semi-translucent opening beyond which he can see
  mountains, hills, and the road he drove off of.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> slams on his brakes, nearly avoiding
  crashing into a tree. "MILO!" <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> yells out
  in the eerily silent forest.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>, sitting on the passenger side, looks at
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>. <i>Scratch, itch, rub.</i> "Itchy."
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> is tearing at a rash on his left arm,
  "Get out! Get out! Bad place. BAD PLACE!"
</p>

<p>
  "Where is this?"
</p>

<p>
  "Bad place. <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> will tell you&mdash;first
  get out," <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> points to the edge of the
  grove. With a quick U-turn, they make a break for it.
  <a href="../npcs/daelin">A woman with many tentacles</a> shoots a stream
  of grey slime toward the jeep. Swerving quickly, the jeeps leaps lightly into
  the air from the uneven ground, evading the slime, which strikes a tree and
  covers it in a cocoon.
</p>

<p>
  After crossing the threshold, the jeep is back on the road. Neither the grove
  nor <a href="../npcs/daelin">the woman</a> are anywhere to be seen. The
  night sky is much darker and there is a glow and heavy smoke in the distance.
  Looking more closely, it is coming from the military base. There is no sign
  of the helicopter that was pursuing him.
</p>

<p>
  "AHHHH! Evil fire. <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> does not want to go
  there," <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> says, pointing to the glow and
  smoke on the horizon. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> stops the jeep and
  asks <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> where they just were. "It is one of
  <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia's</a> groves.
  <a href="../npcs/daelin">That druid</a> took it over. It used to be one
  of <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia's</a> friends, but is now corrupted."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> the grove moves around, never staying in
  one place. <a href="../npcs/daelin">The druid</a> must have wanted to
  capture him and moved the grove to be right in front of the jeep.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> begins driving away from the burning
  base.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> asks
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>, "Where is
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>?"
</p>

<p>
  "Somewhere in Colorado."
</p>

<p>
  "Ca lo ra do. Should <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> tell your friend
  that you are in Ca lo ra do?" After some more talking
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> determines the friend is
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>. <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>
  agrees to tell <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> that
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> is in Colorado. "Stay in populated areas.
  The grove is harder to open in those places," says
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> as he disappears.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> stops at a gas station, finds out from
  the attendant that he is near Durango, and gets directions to the nearest
  town. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> stops at Walmart for a change of
  clothes. He then rents a sports car and alters it using his mechanical
  expertise, disabling the speed regulator. Driving as fast as he can,
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> drives to Pax.
</p>

<h2>The others</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>, <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/lefty">Lefty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> step through
  <a href="../npcs/daelin">the druid</a>'s portal.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> collapses from the intense power used to
  open it as <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> maintains the
  portal. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> checks on
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>, who is alive, breathing and stable.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> exchange words and wish each other well,
  then <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> drags
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> back to the other van.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> sets the van in gear heading back to the
  Pelican.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> soothingly assures
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> that he will ensure its safety.
  <i>[Okay, I'm sick of calling it "<a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>,"
  so now its name is <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a> (Communications
  Interference Device) until someone gives me a name that I can write and
  pronounce.]</i> <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a> relaxes and is grateful
  for <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon's</a> friendship.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a> stretch their legs, wandering outside
  near the plane. <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> picks up hunks of
  scrap metal and rocks that he saves to throw as ammunition later.
  <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a> flaps around some, happy to be in an open
  space.
</p>

<p>
  Swirling lights and a fizzing noise catch
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon's</a> attention as a portal opens near
  <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a>. A woman with many tentacles rushes
  towards <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> runs at the woman, who extends her
  hand. Streaming goo covers <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>, trapping
  him in an instantly hardening cocoon.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>, driving back to the plane, sees
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> being gooed and steers directly
  toward <a href="../npcs/daelin">the druid</a>. The van's impact sends
  <a href="../npcs/daelin">the druid</a> flying and skidding on the
  ground. <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a> hops over to
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> and pecks at the hardened goo.
  <a href="../npcs/daelin">The druid</a> gets up and runs back through the
  portal.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone gets back in the plane and takes off for Pax. On the way back,
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> awakes, but is in a weakened state from
  the rush of magic that coarsed through him. His left hand feels as though it
  has aged many years. His hair shows many years of aging with streaks of grey.
  We each fill each other in on what has happened.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> talks about his carving hobby, making
  animals from rock. We learn that <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>
  works at a <a href="http://www.casualmale.com/">Big & Tall</a> shop.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> work with Libra to translate
  <a href="../npcs/bird">CID's</a> language. They ask
  <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a> about
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "When I was summoned there were some trolls beating a little man named
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>. I think it was warning him not to
  interfere. I like <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>; he consoled me,
  telling me he thought that it was wrong in how I was being used and treated.
  He promised he would find a way for me to get home."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> tells <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a>
  that <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> turned into a monster and attacked
  him.
</p>

<p>
  "<a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> is unique. Even though he seems a
  little crazy, he is more clear-headed than the rest of
  <a href="../groups/gaia">Gaia's Order</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> is the only one not filled with rage.
  The rest are all very angry with humans.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx">The pixie</a> that played the flute that brought
  me here gave a speech, saying the humans would pay for what they have done to
  <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a>."
</p>

<p>
  Libra tells <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> that the language will take a
  while to analyze but should be able to come up with an initial translation
  program in a few hours.
</p>

<p>
  After some time passes, <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> appears and
  falls down, barely getting out a hello. <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>
  scurries over and hugs <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> tells us that
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> is in "Ca lo ra do" and is headed to Pax.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> is injured, so
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> moves slowly to him and treats
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo's</a> wounds.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> asks about what
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> turned into back at the lab.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> doesn't want to answer, but
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> is insistent.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> weeps that his people turn into monsters
  because <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a> is angry.
  <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a> is sick, and needs to be healed.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> does not know why
  <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a> is sick but believes that whatever makes
  her sick is what makes human magic bad. <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>
  is angry with <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> since he was ignored back
  at the lab.
</p>

<p>
  We ask where the flute is. <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> tells us that
  <a href="../npcs/nyx">Nyx</a> used it to summon
  <a href="../npcs/bird">CID</a>, but then disappeared.
</p>

<p>
  We ask about <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo's</a> people.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> tells us, when the pyramid was built,
  <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a> went to sleep and
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo's</a> people disappeared. He then tells us
  that he has to go or he'll be found. If we need him again, he says, just call
  and he'll try to come.
</p>

<p>
  We get back to Pax and arrange for <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>
  to sleep in a tree near Angels (at the Garden).
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> goes home, grabs some things and
  sleeps near <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> programs something that will
  automatically wake up <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> if anything
  unusual happens. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> heads off to
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> headquarters.
</p>

<p>
  At home, <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> gets his bowling ball and
  carving kit, and buys some new clothes.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> leaves a message for his boss that
  he's got some personal business to attend to and will not be available for a
  couple of weeks. He also stocks up on general camping supplies.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> checks himself into the medical facility
  at <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> makes it back into town, gets changed and
  heads to the nightclub just as it closes. There are no messages for
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>. He stays out for the evening.
</p>

<h2>The next morning</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> checks on
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> in the morning.
  <a href="../npcs/bird">The bird</a> flies off and gets its own
  breakfast.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> goes to
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> to find out what's going on
  and then checks himself into the medical facility.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> looks for
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> at HQ and is redirected to the skylift,
  but it is locked and no one is there. Looking in a phone book, he tries to
  call various folks. Eventually, he goes to HQ and waits, and
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> finally joins him there. They go inside
  and meet up with <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> tells them that
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> was taken, then gets some rest.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> gets
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> a
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> ID badge, then goes to the
  main computer to do some research.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/toothy">Toothy</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles">Bubbles</a> enter the medical facility and
  meet up with <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>. They tell them that
  <a href="../npcs/winston">Winston</a> was lost. The group fills them in
  on what's going on with the communications.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> learns that
  <a href="../npcs/shannon">Shannon</a> is still fine, though traumatized.
  <a href="../npcs/daelin">The druid</a> had already eaten
  <a href="../npcs/winston">Winston's</a> brain, and was about to eat
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul's</a> brain, when they were rescued.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> researches the computer logs and manages
  to undelete the missing logs (although he cannot determine who deleted them
  since it was done from a null account login).
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> is impressed at the completeness of the
  modifications. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> goes through the motions
  that <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> did on researching
  <a href="../npcs/patrick">Robert Patrick</a> (drill sergeant) and
  following <a href="../pcs/pete">William Moss</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/patrick">Patrick</a> was a recent hire, part of the
  force that descended upon Pax six months ago. He moved to Pax shortly after
  it was rebuilt.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> spends more time studying the hacking
  job. It was done by something very quickly and efficiently, as though a
  <a href="../groups/zodiac">Zodiac computer</a> did it. Libra chimes in,
  saying it is the same way she would have done it. The job would have had to
  be done faster than a human could, with multiple simultaneous tasks. The only
  thing that doesn't fit the situation is why the deleted log wasn't zeroed
  out.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> finds
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>, <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles">Bubbles</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/toothy">Toothy</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> and fills them in. They
  postulate it may have been the government.
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles">Bubbles</a> wonders what the point is. Maybe
  they wanted to get more information about the weaknesses of
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a>. They ponder on where Moss
  could have gone.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> asks Libra about the unstable
  <a href="../groups/zodiac">Zodiac computers</a>. Libra says that some
  individuals had varying morality and power corrupted a number of them. The
  first tests were done on "hardcore" criminals. At first there wasn't an
  expectation that these computers would be as powerful as they were. Some of
  the first ones created are more rash, and thus not as thorough.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> reluctantly allows Libra to try taking
  him over, and his patch successfully prevents Libra from doing so.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles">Bubbles</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/toothy">Toothy</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> leave to question folks, to see
  if <a href="../pcs/pete">"Cid"</a> told anyone where he went.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> gets <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>
  a security pass.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint">Half-Pint</a> comes back and tells us that no
  one knows where Moss went or what happened to him. Someone said he was
  waiting for an appointment that night at 2200. It was supposed to be
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a>, wanting to talk about
  something. They never showed up, so he left.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> tries using Divination to locate
  <a href="../pcs/pete">William Moss</a>. The magic fails, with
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> feeling as though he's blind, trapped in
  a tiny room with no way out. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> hear a woman's voice as a
  familiar-looking red-haired woman walks into the room: "It's not going to
  work, <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>&mdash;the magic is blocked. Don't
  you recognize me? It's me, <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a>!"
</p>
