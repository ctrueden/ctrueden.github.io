<h3>Session start: Sunday, January 1, 2034 &ndash; 1800 PST</h3>

<p>
  Eight pixies appear with bows and arrows. "Hand over the flute! And the
  circlet too!"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> bolts, breaking down the door and
  barreling past the guard on the other side. He starts up the jeep and readies
  it as a getaway vehicle for the others.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> moves to protect
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a>, then notices that
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> is not wearing her signature
  medallion and asks why not. She responds, "Because I have *this* instead,"
  and an eyestalk emerges from her solar plexus and blinks at
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>. He resists its charm effect. Vexed,
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> produces two more eyestalks, one
  more aimed at <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> and one aimed at
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> resists the sleep effect, but
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> succumbs to the charm effect.
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> suddenly feels as though
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> is her best friend, who will
  reward her greatly for her service. "Give me the circlet," she orders, and
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> complies.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> fire his plasma cannon, taking down a
  pixie. Two pixies retaliate, shooting at <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a>.
  One of the arrows hits him in the head and he falls to the ground
  unconscious.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> quickly assembles her flute
  and plays it, visualizing a safe place for her and her friends. Several
  pixies attempt to grab the flute, but <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a>
  fends them off. Everyone begins to shimmer in a rainbow of color (including
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> and the jeep outside), and they
  disappear, finding themselves in the northern California redwoods.
</p>

<p>
  They drive to a nearby gas station and refuel the jeep, as well as grabbing a
  bite to eat.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> wakes up, but he seems to have lost his
  memory. He is surprised to learn his name is
  <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk Phoenix</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> take turns driving until they get back
  to the outskirts of Vancouver, making it past the Canadian border without a
  problem. Everyone sleeps when possible during the trip.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> boards the plane, and everything looks
  good. His motorcycle is now completely fixed. He starts it up and it runs
  fine. Everyone else gets on the plane as well.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> wants to return the flute to
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a> in the city, but
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> are strongly against it, on the grounds
  that she had eyestalks. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> take the jeep to a nearby gas station
  and find a payphone. They call the number given to
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> for contacting
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xelakov</a>. A deep-voiced man named Butch
  answers. "Weren't you just here?" he asks
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> when she identifies herself. He says
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xelakov</a> shows up every night at eight, like
  clockwork. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> says she'll be there, and
  that they better have her money ready.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> borrows a tuning chime from
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a>, and from
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> snares a flare and a shop manual.
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> tricks
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> into sitting in one of the passenger
  seats, which then restrain her. <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> uses
  the borrowed items to exorcise <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>,
  dispeling the charm effect on her. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>'s
  restraints open, and she immediately tries to punch
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a>, but he dodges.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> calms down, confused about her changing
  feelings regarding <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Anastassia</a>.
</p>

<p>
  They discuss what to do next. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> wants to
  go kick the eyestalk creature's ass and get her money, but
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> think that is a bad idea. Instead,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> wants to travel to an island in the
  Caribbean to contact a group of friends.
</p>

<p>
  So, they take off for the Bermuda Triangle.
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> refills the plane's fuel tank at the
  Florida Keys, then <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> directs
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> in the proper directions. They pass
  through a pillar of fog, landing on a small island. There is a three-story
  obelisk on the island, covered in foliage, with the wreckage of a plane and a
  large hole in it.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> notices a figure moving around the side
  of the obelisk and points him out. <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>
  calls out, "Hello?" The figure answers, "Hello!" and walks over. It is
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> is very nervous and readies her pepper
  spray, slinking back. <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> apologizes for
  his behavior as a plague zombie, explaining that he had no control over his
  actions. He also explains that he has lost his memory, and has come to this
  island to try and remember what happened to him since the plane crash. He
  says he remembers his name as Simon Lewis, and that he and his friend Kent
  Clark crashed during a storm in the Bermuda Triangle. "You lost your memory,
  too?" <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a> says. "*I* lost my memory!"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> introduces himself to
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a>, kissing her hand and apologizing again
  for his previous behavior.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> wanders over to the hole
  in the obelisk, and <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> follow him. "We found the flute!"
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> yells at a radio that is visible
  through the hole in the structure. "<a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>?
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel Miller</a>?" an unfamiliar voice asks.
  "Yes," <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> responds. "Hold on, let me
  fetch <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Master Yeslek</a>!" A few moments later,
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> says, "This is
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a>."
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> explains that he found Babylon's
  Horn. <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> tells him to play it.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> wants more of an explanation regarding
  who this Arcane Order is, and why she should help let them out.
  <a href="../npcs/banks.html">Banks</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/summers.html">Summers</a> are also there, and try to convince
  her to play the flute.
</p>

<p>
  Eventually, <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> agrees, and attempts to
  open the portal. A haunting melody that she has never heard before enters her
  mind as she begins to play. The song strikes a chord deep within everyone,
  although they have not heard it before.
</p>

<p>
  A spiraling vortex grows until it is large enough for a tractor to drive
  through. A wizened old man with a long beard steps out. His presence
  intuitively identifies himself as <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> thanks
  <a href="../pcs/erica.html">Erica</a> for releasing them, then orders
  everyone to begin work. The wizards bustle about waving their arms, and huts
  sprout from the ground.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> asks
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> if he can help cure him of his
  amnesia. <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> tries a divination but is
  irritated when it doesn't work.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, a monk named <a href="../pcs/theodolous.html">Theodolous</a>, one
  of the people released, explains to <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>
  and the others that the wizards have become somewhat addled over time. They
  continue to discuss things, filling each other in on several issues.
</p>

<p>
  Suddenly, the air near the plane shimmers, and several figures appear,
  including <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>, <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  and a red-haired woman <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a> recognizes as
  one of <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela's</a> forms.
