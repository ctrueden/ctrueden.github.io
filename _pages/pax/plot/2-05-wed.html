<h3>
  Session start: Sunday, January 1, 2034 &ndash; afternoon PST/MST
</h3>

<h2>The Wednesday group meets Matt</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> seeing a car with flashing lights speeding
  towards him down the highway pulls his motorcycle over nervously hoping the
  officer will pass them by. In his mirror he sees that the stolen Honda Accord
  with the rest of his entourage is doing the same.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> swiveling his head following the
  police car pass them hears the tires screeching and sees it spin around.
  His body jerks nearly falling off the back of the motorcycle as
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> swears loudly and guns the motorcycle
  forward. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, taking
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex's</a> lead, steps on the gas and speeds
  forward.
</p>

<p>
  The police car gains ground quickly. <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>,
 looking out the back window, points out to
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> that the driver is
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>
  thinks for a moment and asks, "The one I shot?"
</p>

<p>
  "You shot him?" <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> looks puzzled and wonders
  why all these magic types are always trying to kill one another.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> ponders for a moment and decides to
  pull over. <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, in the meantime, notices the
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> military uniformed soldiers in
  the police car. "Oh fuck," he thinks to himself, "More of those evil
  ravagers of the earth," and frantically shifts through the remaining gears,
  leaving a trail of smoke behind him and
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, flying high above, is befuddled
  by the scene below and lands near the two cars pulled over on the side of
  the highway.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> gets out of his car and rapidly tells
  about the abduction of the others, <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>,
  and all that has happened the last day in Pax.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon's</a> jaw goes slightly slack as he
  wonders who the hell this guy is and what the heck he is talking about.
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, just getting out of the car, barely
  registers what <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> is telling him, and asks
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>, "What's wrong with you? Are you on drugs
  or something?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>, looking behind, sees that the other
  two cars have stopped some distance back, and decides to jump off the
  motorcycle, believing that <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> has no intention
  of stopping. The pavement tears flesh from his skin as sparks fly from his
  metallic arms, making him question whether that was the best course of
  action. <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, thrown off balance by
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald's</a> sudden movements, crashes the
  motorcycle.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> witnesses the crash in the
  distance and takes flight to check on them. The rest of the group barely
  notices <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon's</a> departure.
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>, a man in his mid twenties who hasn't
  shaved for a few days tells <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> that
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> and hostages were taken to a
  military facility in Colorado.
</p>

<p>
  Flying toward the crash, <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> sees
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> yelling at each other. Then
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> wolfs out and charges
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> rushes to
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> first and lifts him into the air.
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> glares at the two as they fly back to the
  rest of the group. <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> walks back to his
  motorcycle, looking over the damage.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> land next to
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>. <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>
  looks at <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>, sees his road wounds,
  and shakes her head, saying she won't be able to help him for a while.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> accepts some medical attention
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> offers as they walk to the
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> vehicle for a medical kit.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, walking his motorcycle coldly, looks at
  the <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> uniforms. Private Burby,
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>, <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> introduce themselves to each
  other. <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, not giving his name, growls at
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>. He asks
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> if he works for
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>. He growls some more when
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> confirms this.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> gestures that most of them work for
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> looks around, dismayed, and checks with
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> to see if this is true.
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> confirms that he also works for
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> on a contractor basis.
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> goes quiet.
</p>

<p>
  After some more discussion, we decide to meet at back at
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>, <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a>,
  and Private Burby ride with <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> back to Pax.
</p>

<p>
  The others drive off to <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald's</a> bunker.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, carrying the motorcycle,
  follows.
</p>

<h2>Back at the government base</h2>

<p>
  <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK!</em> <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam's</a> attention on
  his experiment wanders as <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> from the
  other room is making noise again. <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK!</em>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> gets up to go drug
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>, again. <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK!</em>
  Each time the sedatives last shorter and shorter. This last time couldn't
  have been more than ten minutes. <em>SQUawk sq.</em>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> returns, "Alright, where were we?"
  <em>squawk SQUAWK!</em> "What? I just gave that thing twice the normal
  dosage." <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK SQUAWK!</em>
</p>

<h2>In the cell</h2>

<p>
  "You," the guard points at <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>, "The
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">general</a> wants to see you."
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> gets up and tells
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> that he'll try to find out what's
  going on. The transparent door slides open and
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> follows the guard out.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> sits back down, looking about.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">The priest</a> is lying down with his eyes
  closed. The guard is busy reading some book. <em>Squawk squawk.</em> What?
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> hears something from the vent.
  <em>Squawk squawk squawk.</em> Putting his ear to the vent, it is
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> yells out to the guard, "Is
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> okay?" The guard has no idea what
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> is talking about.
</p>

<p>
  A low chuckle comes from <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">the priest</a>,
  "Sounds like it is in pain. Not much we can do from here."
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> puts his ear to the vent again to
  listen more. The air around the vent starts to warp and bend around
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a>, looking up, catches
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> vanishing in a warp of space and
  light.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>
  are working near <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. <em>SQUAWK
  SQUAWK SQUAWK!</em> "That last dose was enough to knock out two elephants. I
  just don't understand. That creature's immune system is incredible,"
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  nods in agreement and then sees a warp of space near a vent. <em>SQUAWK
  SQUAWK SQUAWK.</em> <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> appears out of
  nowhere. "Whoa. Nice one <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>!"
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> chuckles. <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK SQUACK.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> demands, "Where did you come from?"
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> shouts over the noise, "I don't
  know, I was standing in the cell listening to
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> and then I was here."
  <em>SQUAWK!</em>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> yells back "You're lying! This lab
  isn't even in the same building." <em>SQUAWK!</em>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> shouts he has no idea how it
  happened. <em>SQUAWK!</em> <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Grey</a> nods to
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>, indicating he is telling the truth.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> watches
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> thrashing about, tied to a table.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> yells to
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> that they want to stop the
  communications outage, but not kill
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. <em>SQUAWK!</em>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> warns not to just free
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. It bites.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> takes a couple steps towards
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>, when
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> screams to stay away from it.
  <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK!</eM> "JUST LOOKING AT IT,"
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> yells back.
</p>

<p>
  "Think it would be better if you go back to your cell,"
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> shouts with a look of hatred towards
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "You're being a bit harsh," yells <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "YOU CAN'T TRUST HIS KIND." <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK.</em>
</p>

<p>
  "Why isn't he a prisoner?" <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> asks,
  pointing to <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "He is helping; you have nothing to offer. You are a threat!" <em>SQUAWK</em>
  "Shut up! Damn monsters," <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> glares from
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> to
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> calms
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> down and tries to convince him that
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> is safe.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> says, "He's a type B and can't be
  trusted. It's in their genes, genetically a monster. Maybe he's calm now, but
  he'll turn on you. It's their nature."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> is visibly upset. "What the hell's
  wrong with you? You blame an entire species for the actions of a few?"
  <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK</em>
</p>

<p>
  "SHUT UP!" <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> grabs a really big needle
  and jams it into <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>, emptying the
  entire syringe. <em>SQUAWK SQUAWK SQUAwk squa.</em>
</p>

<p>
  "Calm down!" <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> yells towards
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>. <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>
  drops the needle going a little slack and agrees.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> thinks he saw some faint orange glowing
  from <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>'s eyes as she is staring
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> down.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> that
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> has good reason to be distrusting of the
  monsters. All of the type B creatures that they've studied, dozens of them,
  eventually became feral and violent&mdash;even the most passive ones. Even
  worse, one of their most trusted colleagues was type B. He was great agent
  until one day, during a mission, he went insane and ran off, leaving two of
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>'s closest friends to die.
</p>

<p>
  The discussion turns to <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> and he
  begins telling of how he first started gaining weight at an alarming rate. He
  even tried not eating for a while, but it didn't make a difference.
  Eventually he started getting taller.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> asks if she can scan him.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> wants to know if it will hurt. She
  tells him it will not and she begins scanning.
</p>

<h2>Back at the bunker</h2>

<p>
  At the bunker they are greeted by what appears to be an eight-year-old.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> talks with him and asks him to work
  on the motorcycle. <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> excitedly agrees and
  begins tinkering.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, looking to
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a>, asks how secure the location is.
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> reassures him it is very safe. He
  installed the security himself. On a scale from one to ten it is a fifteen.
</p>

<p>
  "That will do," <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> says as he walks to a
  locker to store some things. <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> runs over to
  the locker before <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> can open it.
</p>

<p>
  "NO don't open that." <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> tinkers with the
  locker door and then opens it, showing a very large bomb inside the locker.
  "That was hooked up to the door. But now it is safe."
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> demonstrates by clanking on the bomb with
  a wrench.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, no longer feeling particularly
  safe, decides to leave and meet back in Pax.
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> to fly through the North entrance
  or else he might get dead.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> puts together some gear for the
  upcoming mission. <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> invokes mystical magic
  to repair and enhance <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex's</a> motorcycle.
  Immediately afterwards <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> doesn't look well,
  exclaiming, "Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot!" He runs into the bathroom, door
  slamming behind him followed by a sploosh.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> shakes his head, knowing that magic
  is nasty stuff. He heads to the armory and prepares his gear.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> opens the bathroom door from which
  thick steam comes pouring out mixed with the sounds of
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> snoring. He turns on the fan and lets the
  door close again. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> sets some clay,
  orange juice, a few BB balls, and some crystalline glowing substance on a
  table and begins writing a note for <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> to
  reproduce these items.
</p>

<p>
  After getting his gear together, <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> goes
  into the bathroom to check on <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a>. He's
  sleeping in a half-filled, scorched bathtub. Prodding
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a>, he wakes up.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> warns
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> that using magic is not safe as they walk
  around the bunker.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> notices the items that
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> has laid out on
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip's</a> worktable and asks, "What is all this
  neat stuff? Am I supposed to do something with it?"
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> that he wants him to make copies of these
  things. "Okay..." <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> examining the orange
  juice, "Not sure I can. It's really complex." Looking at a BB ball more
  closely, "It's going to take a long time."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> notices the bit of clay missing from
  the table. "Hey, where is the not-so-useful clay?" What does
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> say? "Useful clay?"
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> looks around, "Okay, where is the
  ever-so-useful clay?" Looking to <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>,
  "Say did you take the ever-so-useful clay?"
</p>

<p>
  "Don't look my way. I did not take that clay. No way! You can trust me, I'm
  okay," <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> responds back.
</p>

<p>
  "Hey, what about you, <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, did you take
  my ever-so-useful clay?"
</p>

<p>
  "Clay you say? What it is this ever-so-useful clay?"
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> asks.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> senses that
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> might know more about the clay.
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> calls his bluff and
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> admits he knows that it was one of
  those things that <a href="../pcs/gustav.html">Weiner</a> developed.
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> demands the clay back.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> furrows his brow, "It is too
  dangerous. It should all be destroyed."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> considers and demands a full
  explanation from <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, "I need to know
  why it must be destroyed." <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> explains
  that anything made from it always goes wrong. Catastrophically wrong. They
  talk more and <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> comes to accept that it
  needs to be destroyed (or at the very least nowhere near his other
  valuables). <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> hands over to
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> an entire bucket of clay.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, seeing the clay and instantly knows it is
  a highly useful commodity that has many valuable uses.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> says the irony is that it is not
  useful at all. <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> is sick of all this
  talk about the clay and fires his rifle on the bucket, vaporizing all of it.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> looks relieved and thanks
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Riding back to Pax, <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> heal each other using their mystic
  ability. <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara's</a> attempt to heal
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt's</a> wisdom backlash partially works, but
  causes her more damage than she healed.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara's</a> remaining wounds are tended to. The
  rest of the ride is mostly quiet as everyone has had a rough couple of days
  and are contemplating what it all means.
</p>

<p>
  Leaving the compound, <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> thanks
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> for everything, but has to cut his
  losses. His and <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx's</a> beliefs and morality are
  diametrically opposed to
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>'s&mdash;a corporation that
  selfishly abuses creatures of the earth and pollutes it with necromancy. Even
  though he respects <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, he simply cannot
  ally himself with anyone that has any fealty to that evil empire.
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> gets on his motorcycle and starts it up.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, "I'm only doing one job for
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>, as a consultant to locate the
  creator of a neural virus. Even so, getting rid of this
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">bird</a> is the important issue right now and
  you would be very useful."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> apologizes and reiterates that he can't
  work with others working for <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>,
  "If you ever leave
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a>, give me a call. I won't
  betray your confidence and I won't help <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  against you."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> breaks what seems like an eternity of
  silence, asking what specific evils
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> is doing because he doesn't
  know anything of the sort.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, "Technology is fine, but human magic
  is very bad. I got extremely ill from you. It takes a lot to make a werewolf
  sick. I just can't be a party to it anymore."
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> extends his hand to
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>.
</p>

<p>
  After another pause, <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> speaks out,
  "Stop being such a pussy and just leave."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> sighs and rides away.
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> looks at his gun and then to
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> whispering, "Should I?"
</p>

<p>
  "Go for it."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex's</a> hears a bullet whiz by, just missing his
  head. Enraged by this treachery, he circles back, driving right at
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> draws his energy riffle, resting it
  on <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>'s neck, telling him "Don't move or
  we'll be breathing your head." <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> steps
  back, drawing his pistol. Suddenly <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>
  goes slack and falls to the ground. <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>
  puts his gun in his holster and takes a step back, looking to
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> and saying, "Easy there, man."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> dives off his motorcycle, tackling
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> to the ground, while
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> gets his gun back out only for
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> to disintegrate it out of his hand.
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> looks extremely surprised and passes
  out inexplicably.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> threatens
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a>, "Release me or die." Unfortunately it is
  not a bluff as <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> ends up vaporizing
  <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex</a> into nothingness when his demand is not
  met. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a>, weak from the use of such power,
  gets slowly back to his feet only to be clubbed into unconsciousness by
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, not interfering, continues watching
  as <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> ties up
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> is stuffed in a closet, while in
  another room <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> is tied to a table.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> uses some smelling salts to rouse
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> wakes up to find his hands and feet
  tied together in darkness. Using mystical energies, he utterly destroys the
  ropes, but then falls unconscious again from the backlash.
</p>

<p>
  "Tell me what you know about <a href="../npcs/pdk.html">PaleDeathKnight</a>!"
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> interrogates
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "What? Who? What's your name? My name is Dave,"
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> answers back with an odd accent.
</p>

<p>
  "What do you do, Dave?"
</p>

<p>
  "I sell insurance."
</p>

<p>
  "Who do you sell insurance for?"
</p>

<p>
  "God, I haven't shaved in a week!" <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>
  exclaims, feeling his chin.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> turns to
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, asking him, "What do you make of
  this?" <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> shrugs and looks at
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> as he is talking again.
</p>

<p>
  "I sell insurance for CUNA Mutual."
</p>

<p>
  "What's the name of your boss?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> Dave answers, "I don't know, my last
  boss just got fired. I'm on vacation. Where am I? I just wanted to see
  Europe." <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> angrily turns over the
  table. <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> Dave screams out in fear, "What
  did I do?" <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> turns, ignoring him, and
  leaves, telling <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> he has decided to
  return to <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> immediately.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> asks if he should to wake
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> and all go together.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a>, walking out of the building, tells
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, "I don't care what you do."
</p>

<p>
  "Uhhhh," <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> groans, awaking to an
  overzealous <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> asking over and over again
  whether he is okay. Checking his internal clock, fifteen minutes have gone
  by. <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> informs
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> that
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> left for
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> and we'd meet up with everyone
  there. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> moves stiffly to his vault,
  finding and drinking the orange drink. It instantly fully restores his
  health. A second later his throat closes up. Unable to breathe,
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> passes out.
</p>

<p>
  Déjà vu, <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> is again there asking if he is
  okay. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> gets up again, expecting there to
  be wounds, but then realizes that he is fully healed. Checking his internal
  clocks, another twenty minutes have gone by.
  <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> marvels that he's never seen a man so
  determined to choke to death. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef's</a> very
  irritated expression tells <a href="../npcs/pip.html">Pip</a> it is time to
  get out of <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef's</a> way and leave him alone.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> unties
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> from the overturned table and asks him
  what happened. <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> has no idea.
  The last thing he remembers was his gun disintegrated out of his hand.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> tells about
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald's</a> interrogation of
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>, who said he was David, an insurance
  salesman. <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>, shifting uncomfortably,
  looks down at this feet.
</p>

<p>
  "Alright <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a>, just honestly tell me what
  happened."
</p>

<p>
  "I swear to you I have no memory of any of this."
</p>

<p>
  "Then what do you know about the answers that 'Dave' gave?"
</p>

<p>
  "They're wrong?"
</p>

<p>
  "What's right about them?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> asks if they can speak alone and
  looks briefly over to <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> senses the tension and leaves.
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> begins confessing...
</p>

<h2>Meanwhile, at Pax Artificium</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> asks if
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> can load down the sensor information
  on <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. Perhaps that could be used to
  track it if the Colorado lead ends up a dead end.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  head to the hangar to see if the Pelican has been repaired is ready for use.
  When they get to the lobby they meet up with
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>. The Pelican repairs are
  complete and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> gets the clearances needed
  to take it to Colorado.
</p>

<h2>Josef goes off on his own</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> that he has some other loose
  ends to tie up. He won't be able to go with him to Pax, but has
  <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> provide
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> with a map to the military
  installation at Colorado. <a href="../pcs/josef.html">Josef</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> that he will find him later to help
  him find the clone.
</p>

<h2>Fire at the base</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> injects yet another series of chemicals
  into <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> lost count at the sixteenth
  injection as he sits patiently while
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> is scanning him; or more
  correctly, continually staring in the way where she is almost seeing through
  him as though he didn't exist. <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> exclaims,
  "The immune system of this thing is incredible! Even the partial DNA samples
  I've managed to take keep shifting and are never the same."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, experimenting with the scanning device,
  notices smoke coming from one of the lab doors. "Fire!"
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> goes to feel the door, which is hot to
  the touch, "Why haven't the sprinklers gone off?" Before anyone can answer
  an alarm goes off and water from the sprinklers erupts.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>, "I sense powerful backlash. We
  need of get out of here!" <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> thinks
  they should first put out the fire and grabs a fire extinguisher.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> panics, "We need to get out here. That
  fire can't be put out. Look! The water and the fire extinguisher aren't doing
  anything." <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> runs out of the lab.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> he plans to carry it out and asks it
  not to bite him. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>, sensing
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> understands and will not attack him,
  unties it and slings it over his shoulder.
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a>, offering no resistance, sends
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> the vibe that the fire is very bad
  and that they need to get out.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> realize the futility of fighting
  the fire and run out following <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tries to grab one of the devices that
  measure anomalies, but can't find one. Thinking to himself, "At least I
  should be able to build one using the schematics I downloaded before."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> sprints with
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> out of the building to see that all
  the buildings are on fire. People are scrambling everywhere, getting into
  jeeps and helicopters, and running out of the base.
</p>

<h2>Gerald returns to Magitech</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> arrives at
  <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> and meets up with
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>. As he is walking up, he sees the
  elevator door close with <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> in it.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> breathes a sigh of relief.
  "That guy's crazy. And I thought I was fast!"
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> that there are some delays at
  the bunker and that <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> might not be that
  helpful.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>s then walks in. After a few minutes
  of talking, <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> return.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> fills everyone in on what transpired
  at the bunker and about <a href="../pcs/rex.html">Rex's</a> death.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> wants a pledge from us to help
  capture his clone if he is to help out with the mission to Colorado.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> is suspicious of
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> and prods him to talk more about
  <a href="../npcs/anna.html">Anna</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> has some vague recollection of some
  reference to her and asks who she is.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> tells him that
  <a href="../npcs/anna.html">Anna</a> is hunting down his clone.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> thanks him for that information, but
  asks whether anyone will help. No one says anything.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> looks disappointed, but hands over
  the map from <a href="../npcs/grimm.html">Grimm</a> of the base to the
  pilot. <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> asks if he can catch a ride
  to Colorado, as that is closer to where he wants to be.
</p>

<p>
  No one says much more as we all board the Pelican and start flying out to
  the base. During the flight <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> spends some
  time learning more nuances on taking off and landing the Pelican.
</p>

<h2>The rescue</h2>

<p>
  Approaching the base, there is heavy smoke over the hills.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> takes to the air, scouting ahead
  as the rest of us land. We all pile into the van and drive to the base.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> sees
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> start walking off and disappear,
  then reappear on a distant peak.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, seeing the chaos, gets into
  superhero mode. Out of a building, a really tall guy with a
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">huge bird</a> on his shoulders runs out.
  Approaching <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> to come with him if he wants to
  survive. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> accepts and is flown back
  to the van.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> takes off again to save more
  people. He lands by <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>, telling them that they need to
  get out of here. He asks where the prisoners are so he can save them.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> which building the cell is in.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> rips through the cell door to
  rescue <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> who is chanting in
  the cell. He tells <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, "Do not
  worry. The fire cannot hurt us; it is the fire of God."
</p>

<p>
  The van pulls up to the base. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> sees
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> and heads towards them, warning
  the others that the woman is the one who abducted them.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> talk as they leave the burning
  building. <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> that
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> is not to be trusted.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> agrees.
</p>

<p>
  The van doors open, weapons all trained on
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a>. 
  "<a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, get in."
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> starts getting in and is talking with
  the red-haired, orange-eyed woman, asking if she'll come along.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tells us that she is okay and that there
  was a big misunderstanding. <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> that she has other things to take care
  of. "Perhaps we'll meet again," she says and heads off.
</p>

<p>
  After another ten minutes, all the buildings have burnt down. After another
  twenty minutes of searching the now empty burnt down base, there is no sign
  of <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> or <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>.
  We hope they escaped as we head back to the Pelican.
</p>

<h2>The search for the Fabulous Four</h2>

<p>
  Riding back to the Pelican, <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> tells us
  he can now understand what <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> is
  saying. We bombard <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> with various
  questions, learning that it is not from this realm of reality, but was
  summoned here by <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>. It can't return on its
  own, and can't turn off its wireless interference.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">The priest</a> admits that perhaps he
  misjudged this <a href="../npcs/bird.html">bird</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> turns to
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> for some aid with his
  wandering attention (resulting from his use of mystic magic).
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> agrees to help, but warns
  that his ability to do so is not unlimited.
</p>

<p>
  Conversation turns to the <a href="../races/halflings.html">halfling</a>
  named <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> that keeps appearing right before
  crazy things start happening. He is friends with
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> and warned us about the siren, large dog,
  and <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. Folks are disturbed to learn
  that <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> turned into one of
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia's</a> spawn (like the ones that attacked us
  in the Bermuda Triangle) and attacked <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> tells us that
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> feels a large portion of
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humanity</a> needs to be eliminated. Another
  of her flock told us that she was trying to recruit individuals like us that
  have mystic ability.
</p>

<p>
  During the flight back to Pax, we decide that searching for
  <a href="../npcs/winston.html">Winston</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/toothy.html">Toothy</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles.html">Bubbles</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>, and
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> should be our next priority.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> wants us to help find
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> and deliver him to his
  superiors. <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> is the key in the
  salvation against these demons. <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> doesn't
  want to pick sides, because none of them ever turn out to be good.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Raphael Douglas</a> that she wants to meet
  these superiors and if they are decent folk she will help.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> says they can leave for
  Italy after finding the missing comrades.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> asks
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> how her mom is feeling. She admits
  that <a href="../npcs/anna.html">Anna</a> is her mom and is still sick from
  <a href="../npcs/janus.html">that elf</a>. She talks in her sleep about a
  circlet that can expel the corrupting influence.
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> says
  <a href="../npcs/anna.html">Anna</a> wasn't herself&mdash;she was that other
  being&mdash;when she was hunting down
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop's</a> clone.
</p>

<p>
  Circling Pax, we look for the base, but that turns out to be like looking
  for a needle in haystack somewhere in Kansas.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> has an idea to use her mystic ability to
  guide us. Starting out from the North gate,
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> meditates and a glowing trail of tire
  tracks appear to her. The pilot flies along the road as
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> directs.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> strains to hold the sight for nearly a
  half hour when the tracks move to a service trail.
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> collapses as she has struggled beyond
  what is safe to get them this far. A burning sensation in her eyes starts
  gathering when <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> to uncover her eyes and let him absorb
  the negative energies. Black wisps of smoke pour from
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara's</a> eyes, circling
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a>. He starts to convulse
  like someone who has taken an overdose of sugar, overwhelmed with energy
  coarsing through his body. When it stops <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>
  feels fine and <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">the priest</a> looks worn out.
</p>

<p>
  Following the service trail leads to a small runway with a hangar.
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> scouts ahead into the hangar and
  finds the vans. He opens the hangar doors, setting off the alarm. Freaking
  out, <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a> rips out the alarm control
  panel, but it doesn't stop. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> rushes in
  and disables it.
</p>

<p>
  After a few tense minutes we sense that no one is here and no one is coming.
  We find the van that the
  <a href="../npcs/winston.html">Winston</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bubbles.html">Bubbles</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/toothy.html">Toothy</a>,
  and <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> were held in.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> senses something
  otherworldly about the inside of the van.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> reconstructs the events that occurred in
  the van using his mystic abilities. A portal opened in the van and a hideous
  woman stepped out with tentacles rippling forth from all her exposed skin.
  <a href="../npcs/halfpint.html">Half-Pint</a> said, "Oy, who's there?" She
  put out her hands and tendrils shot out, cocooning each of them completely
  in some hardened white gel substance. Each of them connected to her fingers,
  she stepped back into the portal and pulled them all through...
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a> tells us the woman described is
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">the druid</a> serving
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>, with the help of
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>, <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>, folds time, recreating the
  portal. <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">Father Raphael</a> holds the portal
  open as
  <a href="../pcs/sara.html">Sara</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/moses.html">Speed Demon</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/lefty.html">Lefty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gerald.html">Gerald</a> leap through.
