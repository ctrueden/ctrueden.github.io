<h3>
  Session start: Monday, January 2, 2034 &ndash; 1100 PST
</h3>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> is brought from the prison cell to meet
  with <a href="../npcs/carter.html">General Carter</a>. Carter greets
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>; "I brought you here for an opportunity.
  How would you like a chance to serve your country?"
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> stammers, not sure what to say. "I've seen
  what happens to those like you, like this morning, when you ended up on the
  floor babbling, barely able to talk. It gets worse. Pretty soon you turn into
  a vegetable. My scientists have created these (putting a bottle of pills on
  the table). Take these and you will not die from doing things a man should
  not doing." The bottle label has only a handwritten telephone number on it.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>: "Uh, what do I have to do?"
</p>

<p>
  "Just keep an eye on the others."
</p>

<p>
  "I just met them. I don't really know them."
</p>

<p>
  "That's probably good. They haven't had a chance to pervert you with their
  evil ways. They might have good intentions, but whatever they do causes
  catastrophic consequences. There must be a line drawn and I intend to draw
  that line. You go back to your normal life and call me once we take care of
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">that bird</a>."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> agrees with lukewarm enthusiasm. He and
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">General Carter</a> notice smoke coming from
  under the door. The sprinklers activate as
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">Carter</a> opens the door to a roaring fire.
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">Carter</a> tries using a fire extinguisher.
  Neither that nor the sprinklers seem to be affecting the fire.
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">Carter</a> opens a secret exit and
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> follows him down a dimly lit tunnel for 20
  minutes. <a href="../npcs/carter.html">Carter</a> turns to
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>, "It's been a pleasure to work with you,
  but I can't let you see the end of this tunnel."
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> sees
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">Carter</a> point a gun and feels something hit
  his neck passing out.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> wakes up, being shaken by the shoulders. A
  big guy in overalls is there. He speaks with a deep South accent: "Hey there,
  are you okay, buddy?"
</p>

<p>
  "I don't know."
</p>

<p>
  "You need a ride, buddy?"
</p>

<p>
  "Where am I?" Looking around, <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> sees he's on
  the side of the road with a large truck stopped near by.
</p>

<p>
  They talk for a while. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> learns that he is
  some fourteen hours away from Pax and gets a ride there. The truck driver's
  name is Joe and they listen to music on AM 780 (the "Voice of God" network).
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> falls asleep on the truck and is woken at
  0900 the next day in Pax. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> thanks Joe for
  the ride and gets his pizza vehicle from the space lift parking lot, then
  drives back to his apartment.
</p>

<p>
  "It won't work <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, it's been blocked," says
  a red haired beautiful woman, "Don't you recognize me? It's
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>." <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  appears out of nowhere and is speaking incoherently about some virus in
  <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Sam's</a> head (I wanted to try to act like Skank
  from the Crow when he brought to the big boss after TJ is killed&mdash;all
  excited, speaking on speed, and somewhat incoherent).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>, <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> go to find
  <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Sam</a> and the rest of the group.
</p>

<p>
  Even though communications are still down,
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon's</a> cell phone rings, displaying the
  caller is unknown. It is <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> telling
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> it is worried and concerned. Images
  accompany the sounds showing the streets below and somehow Gordon senses they
  are filled with small, invisible figures.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> to look for him outside and they'll
  meet up. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> the streets are overrun with invisible
  creatures and it is time to get out of the city.
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> whispers, "I think they are pixies."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>, driving to his apartment, sees something
  zip by. Using mystical vision he is able to find and follow the creature
  flying to <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> HQ where it flies
  into a window some twenty floors up. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> waits
  in his car to see what happens next.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> goes to use the computer console, but it
  is no longer available. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks Libra to try
  but is told the systems are all down. <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> start heading to the elevator.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>
  find the blood left behind from <a href="../pcs/zuul.html">Sam</a> lying on
  the ground, but no one else is there. In the room they were in a window is
  broken. The head back and meet up with <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tells them the elevators are out and the
  all the computer systems are down.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> senses something watching them and sets
  off the sapphire sprinklers. A figure is highlighted in the air ten feet
  away. It runs and we chase it to the open window.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> sees
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> in the pizza truck.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> sees the mysterious figure fly out of the
  window and down. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> then senses there are many
  more pixies here.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> suggests that we bring back
  <a href="../npcs/cid.html">Cid</a> to protect the computer. She suggests that
  we can research this using magic near the obelisk in the Bermuda Triangle.
  After some short discussion we agree that is where we should go next.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>, <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a>,
  and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> head for the stairs. They see
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> leap out of the window, saying that he'll
  see them down there. <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> follows
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and jumps out the window.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> notices that
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> isn't wearing her amulet.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> watches another figure fall gently down out
  the window followed by another woman falling full speed. Just before she hits
  the ground she slows and lands gently.
</p>

<p>
  We all meet on the first floor lobby. It is strange, but no guards or workers
  are present. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> find the door to the
  security room locked. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> try to smash the door down.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> gets impatient and shoots the lock
  mechanism. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> gets to the computer system
  but it is down.
</p>

<p>
  We pile into the pizza vehicle and go to the hangar. We see
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> flying behind us, following us.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> asks <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> on
  the way whether he would analyze some drugs.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> says he will a little later. We do our
  best to avoid any pixies along the way.
</p>

<p>
  We take the Pelican out of Pax. Amazingly the plane was retooled this morning
  and fully refueled. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> notes that some extra
  fuel tanks were added.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> goes on to explain divination magic is
  currently suppressed, but there is a hole in that right above the obelisk.
  She tells us about the flute, which she went through great pains to acquire,
  that was then stolen from her. <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> says that
  a circlet is needed to return <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> to its
  home. <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> asks what happened to
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela's</a> amulet and she says that the ones who
  stole her flute have her amulet as well.
</p>

<p>
  We ask about <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Everlily Nyx</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> knows her and says she's not as bad as
  everyone thinks she is. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> talk about how
  <a href="../races/humans.html">human</a> magic isn't quite right (tainted).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> realizes he's never seen
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> before. We determine that it was
  backlash that has made him forget about
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a>. We catch
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> back up on what has happened.
</p>

<p>
  The group talks of nonhumans for a while.
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> is a
  <a href="../races/gnomes.html">gnome</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> is not
  <a href="../races/humans.html">human</a>, although he claims he used to be
  <a href="../races/humans.html">human</a>. Discussion turns to how
  <a href="../races/humans.html">human</a> magic is bad. We can't come up with
  a good solution. <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> sarcastically says that
  killing all <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> would solve the
  problem. None of us really take her seriously.
</p>

<p>
  We realize that we don't know how to get to the island.
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> says she doesn't know how to get there.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> assumes it is because divination magic is
  not working and she doesn't have her amulet.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> wants to know what the heck is going on.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> explains that magic is real and tells him
  how it works and what backlash is. He explains we're going to the Bermuda
  Triangle to learn what we need to return
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> to it home.
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> chimes in and tells us it can find
  this place. We agree that as we near the Triangle we'd let
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> out and follow it.
</p>

<p>
  We then ask <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> what she knows of
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>. She finds him annoying and would rather
  not talk about it.
</p>

<p>
  We talk about <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">the priest</a> and all that we
  know about him. [See, we're the good party; we SHARE information!]
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> tells us that he got some drugs from
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">the general</a> at the base that helps him with
  a condition he has that will turn him into a vegetable.
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> shares most of what he has experienced
  except for the part where <a href="../npcs/carter.html">General Carter</a>
  asked him to observe us and report back.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> starts to analyze the drugs. The fumes
  reduce or suppress his mystic abilities leaving a numb feeling.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> surmises that this prevents mystic magic
  from working. It will take maybe an hour to just recover from the fumes.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> destroys the open pill that he was
  studying.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> talks with
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> later and presses him to learn that
  <a href="../npcs/carter.html">General Carter</a> wants
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> to spy on them and report back.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> talks with
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> later and learns that she hates
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> because he is disobedient.
</p>

<p>
  We learn that the flute used to be called Babylon's Horn and that she wants
  to use it to open a portal to free a friend of hers. After many questions
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> sheepishly admits that her friend is a
  pixie.
</p>

<p>
  Near the Triangle we let <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> out,
  following it through a sporadic path for about an hour. We come to a familiar
  column of fog. <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> calls
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> on his cell phone and confirms this
  is where we want to be.
</p>

<p>
  Landing the plane on the beach we see another plane on the beach with other
  people standing around talking. There are many huts and folks in robes with
  long beards conjuring huts out of thin air.
