<h3>
  Session start: Monday, January 2, 2034 &ndash; 1800 PST
</h3>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a> (a red haired beautiful woman) from the
  Pelican points to two groups of folks saying they are the ones who stole her
  flute. The first group is <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> who are all near
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> plane. The other group is
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>, and the obvious leader of the robed
  figures (has the whitest robe, the longest beard, carrying the most
  impressive staff) who are walking along the beach.
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> recognizes
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> from a band that she once played with. Good
  band, just not her style of music.
  <a href="../npcs/bird">A silvery bird</a> with a fifteen foot wingspan
  lands next to <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> (eight-foot-tall, very
  large human palming a bowling ball).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> walks over to the robed leader.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> move towards
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> plane.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>, <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> get into the van and drive towards
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> greets
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> and tells
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> that
  <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a> is with them.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> convinces us that
  <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a> is false. She attacked the other group
  before and wasn't carrying her amulet.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> begins to call for
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a>. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a>
  arrives on foot. We learn that <a href="../npcs/yeslek">Yeslek</a>, the
  leader of the <a href="../groups/arcaneorder">Arcane Order</a>, and his
  order have been trapped for two millennia on the astral plane. They are here
  to guard the obelisk. When the order completed the obelisk they became
  trapped in the astral plane.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> sees this
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">giant man</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/bird">bird</a> walk towards them.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">The giant</a> asks him to put his gun away.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek">Yeslek</a> learns of this technology and want
  to know more. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> begins explaining things to
  him. <a href="../npcs/yeslek">Yeslek's</a> thirst to learn more never
  seems to end. <a href="../npcs/yeslek">Yeslek</a> seems to be absorbing
  everything that <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> tells him. The two of
  them start heading to the Pelican.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> walks up to
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> and asks him to put away his gun.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> doesn't say or do anything.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> insists.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a> arrives at the van and
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> asks which
  <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a> this is.
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> responds back this is the friendlier
  one. Talking with <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a> we learn that
  he has had some memory problems. He was in NY and was infected by some virus.
  As far as he knows he is Simon Lewis. He and his partner Kent Clark were
  exploring and got lost. Since being on this island other memories have
  starting coming back.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> tugs on
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack's</a> shirt.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> asks who all these people are.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> cows low and eeks. Pointing at
  <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a> who is walking towards the van meeting,
  saying she is really <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a>. He is the
  strictest of his friends and if <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> knew he
  was here talking to <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> he'd be very mad.
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> that he can go if he wants to.
  <a href="../npcs/milo">Milo</a> vanishes.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> challenges
  <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a> that she is really
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a>. <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a>
  admits that he is not <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a>, but wants us to
  agree not to automatically attack him if he changes to his normal form.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> figures out that the pixie that
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> want sot free is Nix.
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> admits it is true.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> is exhausted from all this stupid
  questioning from <a href="../npcs/yeslek">Yeslek</a> and starts making
  up things. That red wire has to be at an exact 40-degree angle for the blue
  wire to provide power to that console-things like that.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone is interrupted by a whirlwind of rocks slamming together which
  creates a gigantic 20 foot tall rock monster of general biped appearance. It
  begins stomping on huts.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> states seriously, "That's probably
  not good."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> tiredly responds, "Again, wrought by
  <a href="../races/humans">humans</a>."
</p>

<p>
  A flurry of activity begins. <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> begins
  inspiring excellence to <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>, <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>,
  and <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> get back in the plane and
  take flight. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> runs along the island to
  sneak up on the rock monster. <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> hides
  behind a tree watching to see how things turn out.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> asks anyone for a book and looks for
  one and eventually he and <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> gets on
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> hovering plane climbing the ladder.
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> leaps from the plane and
  joins <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a>, and the
  <a href="../groups/arcaneorder">Arcane Order</a> in assaulting the rock
  monster. <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> transmutes the rock monster's
  leg into mud. Unfortunately the mud reforms itself into a new mud man
  creature.
</p>

<p>
  The battle rages on with all sorts of magic, bowling balls, sword swinging,
  and gunshots fly about.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a>, <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/lee">Lee</a> decide that everyone needs to get off this
  island. <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> convinces
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek">Yeslek</a> to get all of the Order on the
  plane. They begin to gather all the mages.
</p>

<p>
  The mudman meets its demise then it is tossed some 110 feet in the air and
  splats on the ground.
</p>

<p>
  A few moments later, <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> smashes the rock
  monster into pieces.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> tells folks that that isn't
  <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a>, and this she wants the flute.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> asks whether to launch a volley of
  missiles. <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> says not to, and that he
  wants to go back to the ground and talk with his other friends.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> lands seeing
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> come out of hiding from behind a tree.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> gets on the plane and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> lifts off once again.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> heals one of the wizards
  causing <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> to bleed from his
  hands and feet. <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> then begins
  help reconstructing the huts and convinces the other wizards not to use
  magic.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> says, "There is one more thing you
  should know. Pax is compromised, and our troops control it. If you assist me
  getting me back our leader, I will release the control. I will break my
  agreement with the others. My job is to maintain a physical force to keep the
  city under control."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack">Jack</a> pulls <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>
  aside and points out that <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> told us to use
  the circlet to send <a href="../npcs/bird">the bird</a> back. But
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> tried to deceive them by pretending to
  be <a href="../npcs/xela">Xela</a>. How can this person be trusted if he
  is betraying others to help us?
</p>

<p>
  On <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> plane
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> wants to land to get her money.
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> wants to watch the other anomalies.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> will have none of this and begins to
  leave the island. <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> bicker like they are married with
  comments like, "I don't want to spend the rest of my life tied to your hip."
  The begin to threaten <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a>, so
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> shuts the cockpit doors.
</p>

<p>
  On the ground folks see <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> plane begin
  leaving the island. <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> makes a gesture and
  disappears.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> appears out of thin air on
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> plane.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> wants her money.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> is thrown a bunch of gold coins as a
  down payment. They negotiate she will be paid the rest later.
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> sees an eye stalk come through the
  door. <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> charms
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> and gets him to land the plane.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> says that it is not necessary
  to control <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> mind. There is some
  theological talk about <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a>. Then they begin
  the talk of Christ. <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> gets the low down
  from <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> on what happened. That
  <a href="../npcs/gaia">Gaia</a> is in pain, blah blah blah. Explains
  that the use of this magic is too painful for her. Legends say that long ago
  <a href="../races/humans">humans</a> did not have this problem, but the
  man called Jesus Christ cascaded things.
</p>

<p>
  More theoretical talking of JC. <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane's</a> people
  are the things like pixies. This one says it is a beholder.
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> drops his disguise and shows himself.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> begins to scream out that "we've made a
  deal with the devil" and continues to scream. There is some talk of
  <a href="../races/elves">elves</a>, but
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty's</a> screaming makes it really hard to
  hear anything. <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> asks
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> to stop screaming. She does not.
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> turns an eyestalk to
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and suddenly he entire demeanor
  changes. <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> quietly looks up and says, "Oh
  hi, there you are," in a very pleasant manner.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> realizes that
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> has done some mind control over
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and shoots
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> before he can take over anyone else.
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a> disintegrates into ashes. Everyone goes
  into mad crazy fighting.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> attempts to resurrect
  <a href="../npcs/kane">Kane</a>. It fails.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> shoot at
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> for killing their "best" friend. They
  miss. <a href="../pcs/theodolous">Theodolous</a> disarms
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt's</a> weapon.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> puts up a mystical defense.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon">Gordon</a> stuns
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>, and destroys
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty's</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank's</a> guns.
  <a href="../pcs/liam">Liam</a> wrestles with
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> interrupting her flute playing, but she
  teleports away and runs into the plane.
</p>

<p>
  The portal opens in a swirling vortex. <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a>, and
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> suddenly shimmer and disappear, finding
  themselves aboard the plane. <a href="../npcs/nyx">A pixie</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/pete">William Moss</a> step out of the portal.
