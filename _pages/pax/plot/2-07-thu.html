<h3>
  Session start: Monday, January 2, 2034 &ndash;
    1800 PST &ndash; Obelisk island in the Bermuda Triangle
</h3>

<h2>Bobby Garibaldi</h2>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby's</a> father calls him in to talk to him
  about his first field assignment. His father and man in charge of one section
  of Chicago's underground, <a href="../npcs/bruno">Bruno Garibaldi</a>,
  confides in his son his suspicions about the orders being handed down from
  <a href="../npcs/verardi">Mr. Verardi</a> lately.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> is told that a hit has been put out on
  a man named <a href="../npcs/raphael">Raphael Douglas</a>. Since the
  Garibaldis are known for their knack of finding people, they were tapped for
  this job. <a href="../npcs/bruno">Bruno</a> knows of his son's talents
  to some extent, and wants him to do it. But he cautions him too, saying that
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> should investigate the situation first,
  and attempt to find out what is going on lately with these weird orders.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> visits his grandmother's apartment in
  Chicago and attempts to Scry <a href="../npcs/raphael">Douglas</a> using
  a Latin Bible that he is told belongs to the man.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> locates
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Douglas</a>, seeing his unconscious body lying
  in an abandoned military base. He arranges to be flown there in one of
  <a href="../npcs/verardi">Verardi's</a> private jets. His
  <a href="../npcs/bruno">father</a> sends two bodyguards with
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a>: <a href="../npcs/guido">Guido</a>
  and <a href="../npcs/andrea">Andrea</a> Lorenzi&mdash;devoted to
  <a href="../npcs/bruno">Bruno</a> but not too bright.
</p>

<p>
  Vinny the pilot lands the jet at the Pax Artificium International Airport.
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> sends
  <a href="../npcs/andrea">Andrea</a> to scout out why no one came to
  greet them at the airport, but no one appears to give them any trouble.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> determines that the airport seems to be
  locked up and closed down. They cut a hole in their airport fence, hail a
  taxi and grab two suites on the 28th floor of a nearby Hilton.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a>, <a href="../npcs/guido">Guido</a>
  and <a href="../npcs/andrea">Andrea</a> try to gather information about
  local bars where <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> soldiers
  might frequent. At a nearby steakhouse,
  <a href="../npcs/guido">Guido</a> finds out from the bartender that some
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> personnel are often seen at a
  place downtown near-east called the Garden Eatery, near a park called the
  Garden.
</p>

<p>
  They find a single <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> employee
  there nursing a milk. <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> pays him to find
  out information about the military base to the north from the
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> central computer. He says
  he'll return in an hour, but after waiting for two and half hours, the guy
  still hasn't returned.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> and his men travel the city by taxi and
  ask the driver to take them to "the tougher side of town." They arrange to
  attend a man named Gus's party later that night after midnight.
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> meets Gus's associate,
  <a href="../npcs/reubens">Reubens</a>, who specializes in obtaining
  difficult items and information. They leave the party and meet at his base of
  operations at a refueling station a few minutes outside the city.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/reubens">Reubens</a> he's interested in finding out
  about the military base to the north.
  <a href="../npcs/reubens">Reubens</a> tells him it's infrequently used,
  mostly as a checkpoint about once a month or so.
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> buys a stolen sedan from
  <a href="../npcs/reubens">Reubens</a> and pays him extra for the
  information and some ski masks.
</p>

<p>
  They drive out to the base, and see that the gate has already been forced
  open. <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> locates
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Douglas</a>, unconscious and barely alive. He
  studies the man, unable to wake him, then hears the sound of an approaching
  plane.
</p>

<h2>At obelisk island</h2>

<p>
  The plane gets zapped by some sort of discharge from the portal caused by the
  <a href="../groups/arcaneorder">Arcane Order's</a> prodding, and the
  island disappears. They are now in the middle of the ocean.
</p>

<p>
  "Holy shit!" <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> says, and rushes to start
  up the plane and pull it out of the water.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> concentrates on making some good come
  from this unfortunate event, and the discharge remnants crackle around the
  party, healing them somewhat.
</p>

<p>
  No one is sure exactly where they are, except to guess they are probably
  still in the Bermuda Triangle. They argue about whether to go back to the
  island, or head north-northwest toward the States again.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel's</a>
  <a href="../npcs/metatron">contact</a> tells him that it is
    unfortunately impossible to relocate the island right now. However,
  <a href="../npcs/metatron">Metatron</a> tells him that it is time for
  him to learn the truth about God, and His true purpose for
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "Find a man named <a href="../npcs/raphael">Raphael Douglas</a>. He is
  one of God's servants, but he needs help. If you help him, he is capable of
  assisting some of your companions with their various maladies and he may also
  be capable of assisting you to locate
  <a href="../npcs/bishop">John Bishop</a>."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> attempts to teleport home, and
  succeeds, but her flute disappears from her hands, clattering to the floor of
  the plane. <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> immediately snatches it up
  and stuffs it in her backpack.  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>
  reappears, and when she sees her flute is not here, begins to cry.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> comes out of his trance and asks
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> whether she took
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica's</a> flute. "What are you talking about?"
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> asks, but
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> senses that
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> is bluffing.
</p>

<p>
  "You bitch! Give it back!" <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> screams.
</p>

<p>
  "I still don't know what you're talking about,"
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> says.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> punches
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> in the face.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a> tries to convince
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> to give the flute back to
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>.  They argue about the flute for a
  while, and <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> finally agrees to give it
  back.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> that he is taking orders from the
  Devil, but <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> is skeptical.
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> gives an impassioned speech about how
  everyone who uses magic is really just using witchcraft.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a> goes to the cargo bay in the back and
  plays her flute, then concentrates on making the plane go faster with
  Enhancement and Kinetics. She wards the effect, giving it a boost of speed,
  but the backlash causes her to feel overwhelmed with tiredness, and fall into
  a deep slumber.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> tries out her sunglasses and discovers
  that two of them increase her visual acuity, while the third pair causes a
  burning sensation and the afterimage of the sun. "These are for her,"
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> thinks to herself, imagining giving
  them to <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>.
</p>

<p>
  After a few hours, they arrive at the base, with
  <a href="../npcs/metatron">Metatron</a> leading
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a>, who gives directions to
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> has
  <a href="../npcs/andrea">Andrea</a> ambush
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> as he enters the building.
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> discuss matters, and
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> manages to revive
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> with Healing magic,
  noticing that he has a couple of angry boils on his face.
</p>

<p>
  At <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby's</a> request,
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> explains how he came to be
  passed out on the floor of an abandoned military base. Then they step outside
  and introduce <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/guido">Guido</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/andrea">Andrea</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> to
  <a href="../pcs/dirk">Dirk</a>, <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a>
  and <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> tells
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> that she is spiritually linked to
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a>, probably because she overextended the
  power he senses within her at some point in the past. He says that normally
  he could treat her easily, but that he recently overextended himself and will
  need to rest for a while first.
</p>

<p>
  After a lot more discussion, <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a> mentions
  that they should probably adjourn from the base to a more suitable location
  for continued discussion. They agree on
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica's</a> apartment.
  <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/guido">Guido</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/andrea">Andrea</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/erica">Erica</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel">Daniel</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> ride in the sedan, and
  <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/betty">Betty</a> take the plane back to Pax.
</p>

<p>
  As the sedan pulls down the road, <a href="../pcs/bobby">Bobby</a>
  notices that <a href="../npcs/raphael">Father Douglas</a> is sweating
  and appears very uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
  "I'm sorry, but could you stop the car right away?"
  <a href="../npcs/raphael">Douglas</a> manages to croak out. As it stops,
  he claws at the door handle, trying to get out as quickly as possible. He
  rolls from the car seat onto the ground, and clutches his head.
</p>

<p>
  As the clouds part and the full moon becomes visible, he begins a terrible
  transformation...
</p>
