<h3>
  Session start: Monday, January 2, 2034 &ndash; 0800 PST
</h3>

<p>
  A musical montage of Depeche Mode's "Work Hard" begins as we watch an
  exhausted <a href="../pcs/moses">Speed Demon</a> getting ready to crash
  into bed. <em>You've got to work hard if you want anything at all, gazing
  senselessly at nothing in particular</em>. (Looked more like a teenager's
  room than a super hero's. Don't tell me he still lives at home with his
  parents).
</p>

<p>
  Move to <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef's</a> plane where he and
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> are arguing about who infected
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam Smitts</a> with a virus, and whether to help
  him. <em>Nothing comes easy and that's a fact.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> arrives at the bunker, getting out of
  his Humvee (I hope in the future these vehicles get significantly better gas
  mileage). <em>Nothing comes easy but a broken back.</em> He finds a ransom
  note for <a href="../npcs/pip">Pip</a> on the door. <em>Nothing comes
  easy it never will.</em> "We have your friend. Bring the body of
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam Smitts</a>, the
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> technician, to the warehouse
  on 62nd Ave by midnight tonight, or <a href="../npcs/pip">the gnome</a>
  dies." <em>Nothing comes easy but a broken will.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>, entering the
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> hospital, sees
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> bleeding and dying on the floor and runs
  to him. <em>So work hard.</em>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> asks <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a>,
  "What happened? Are you alright?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a> snaps back, "I've been clubbed on the
  head, shot at, infected with a virus, and I've got a searing pain screaming
  in my head. HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?"
</p>

<p>
  Back on <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef's</a> plane,
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> looks to
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a>, "Are you ready?"
</p>

<p>
  "No, but hit me."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> says, "I don't think it is a normal
  virus," and there is some rippling in the air. We now have a three-way split
  screen with <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>.
</p>

<p>
  "You don't know me, but I'm a friend of
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef's</a>," a young female's voice explains out
  of nowhere (<a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> is a woman? That explains
  all that sexual tension! Then again, I hate Christian Slater so any other
  voice is a good thing).
</p>

<p>
  "Who are you? What is going on?" <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> thinks
  aloud.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> interjects, "It's okay. We're going to
  go into <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam's</a> mind and destroy the virus."
</p>

<p>
  The screen splits. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>, in a nearby room,
  sees <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> in the hall and waves to her. She
  tells him that <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> is injured on the floor,
  bleeding. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> rushes over and begins
  examining <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> asks whether this new person
  (<a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>) is friendly and is joining the group.
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> indicates that
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> is a good person and he is then pulled
  into the "conference call." The female voice introduces itself as
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> (I think the voice is Amy Acker. Now
  that I think about it, I wish Amy was playing
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a>. What's with all these cross-gender
  characters this season, anyway? <a href="../pcs/frank">Frank/Jane</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam/Dana</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a>
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a>?)
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> gathers half the remaining armory
  into his truck and drives off.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> asks
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> about inviting
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> into the group.
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> that he should be left out.
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> tells him
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> is already on his way, nearly there.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses Morningbird</a> is having another
  nightmare. He is walking outside of Pax wearing only torn pants, sweating
  profusely, and staggering in the intense sun. The air shimmers with heat and
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> looks like he is ready to pass out,
  when we see through <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses's</a> eyes a huge tree
  in the middle of the desert. As he approaches, the tree bursts into flames
  and <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> shields his face, but there is no
  heat and the tree is not being consumed.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> moves to the "shade" of this burning
  tree and goes to touch the tree. A flash of light, the scene changes, and we
  now see another woman in her late thirties (sort of an older Julia Stiles
  with darker hair) sitting against the tree. She has pale skin, raven black
  hair, and wears a lab coat. (If you look really carefully, she is wearing a
  nametag with the name <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a>.)
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> somehow inexplicably knows this woman
  is his mother&mdash;his real mother.
</p>

<p>
  The woman smiles and the tree now has apples. She plucks an apple and goes to
  take a bite. <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> up to now has been
  peacefully watching, but now sees a serpent ready to leap at and strike his
  mom. Time slows down and <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> yells out,
  leaping to stop the snake from biting her, but the snake moves faster and
  bites her arm. She cries out in pain and
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> wakes back in his room in a cold sweat.
</p>

<p>
  "Help me my son. Help me." <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> hears the
  woman's voice in his head. <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> has never
  had a voice talk to him after a dream. He feels something within him guiding
  him somewhere. Taking his skateboard, he is eventually led to
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> headquarters.
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> tries to bluff the guard, saying that a
  researcher summoned him here.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> tells the group that the other friend
  is here, the flying one. <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> corrects
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> saying that he is not a friend.
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> says to just let him join.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> calls down the intercom to and says that
  Sam Dodgers will be here soon and send him to the medical floor. The guard
  turns the monitor showing <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> and asks if
  it's him.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> looks carefully and recognizes
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> as
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Speed Demon</a>. He says, "Hey Sam, we're up in
  the medical wing. See you in a few minutes." The communication ends and
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> stares at the guard with a look of
  confusion. <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> is upset that
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> recognized him and tells the guard he has
  no idea who that was. The guard doesn't seem to care and lets him in.
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> asks where R&D is and gets a blank
  stare back.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> gets to
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> HQ and parks underground. He
  is trying to find
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam Smitts</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a> spits up blood, wracked in pain, with his
  vision blurry from the fever. <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> has never
  seen anything like this and finds it frightening.
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> comments that he isn't surprised and
  that it probably wouldn't happen to anyone else.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> gets to the medical floor and sees
  all of us gathered around
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> looks for a place to change into
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Speed Demon</a>. Everywhere there are cameras in
  the building. He really wants to leave the building and come back in, but he
  feels instinctually that there is no time. He has to save his mom. Finding a
  bathroom, he disables a camera (which turns out to be just a prop), changes
  into <a href="../pcs/moses">Speed Demon</a>, flies up an elevator shaft,
  and navigates through the drop ceiling to where the rest of the group is
  standing around <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a> make an agreement.
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a> will help
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> out after his body is taken care of.
  We all head back to a room and all lie down on beds.
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> does something mystical and everyone
  but <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> is whisked into
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam's</a> virtual emporium of conception.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> stays behind to guard our bodies.
</p>

<p>
  We are standing in a complex, sturdy steel, seemly endless corridor. Every
  ten feet on either side of the corridor are doors dimly lit by flickering
  florescent lights.
</p>

<p>
  A glowing blue lion head hovers four feet off the ground, circling around a
  shadowy, almost impossible to detect figure resembling
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a>. A very pregnant
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> has two elven guards standing next to
  her. <a href="../pcs/moses">Speed Demon</a> is a regal super hero in the
  true sense of comic books gone live action hero.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a>, well dressed, is a wise looking
  middle-aged man that moves with a blur about him. Finally,
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> is a twelve-year-old girl covered only
  by a single tentacle, and floats two inches off the ground.
</p>

<p>
  We begin exploring, and <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> quickly senses
  the specific door we want. She tells us we have to hurry and the doors keep
  shifting. <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> asks
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> how she knew, but before she can answer
  we all leap into the laboratory where <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses's</a>
  mom is covered in mucus, surrounded by six large snakes.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses">SD</a> moves to attack the snakes.
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> summons his equipment from nowhere.
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> commands the snakes to sleep with no
  effect. <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> looks toward the snakes and
  exclaims, "Gross!" and one of the snakes crumbles and disappears. A snake
  sizzles into nothing from the blue beams firing from
  <a href="../groups/zodiac">Leo's</a> eyes.
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> gets bit and passes out.
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara's</a> bodyguards appear and each grab a
  snake, twisting them to death. <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> heals
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> and he wakes up. "Exercise caution, my
  Lady [<a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>], these creatures are very
  dangerous," says <a href="../npcs/benek">Benek</a> as he crushes another
  snake. The last snake runs away into the wall.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses's</a> mom is
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a>. S/he gets to her feet and thanks us.
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> begins building up a massive destruct
  bomb force around himself. <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> introduces
  herself as <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef's</a> friend.
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> creates a virtual weapon for
  <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt Jones</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Meanwhile, <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> calls
  <a href="../npcs/leo">General Leo<a> for a favor.
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> wants some tactical information on
  the warehouse. <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> explains and shows the
  ransom note. <a href="../npcs/leo">General Leo</a> suggests that the
  <a href="../groups/magitech">Magitech</a> technical folks should be able
  to get his information. <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> then reports
  to <a href="../npcs/leo">General Leo<a> that
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> is injured but is being looked after.
  <a href="../npcs/leo">Leo</a> says he will send a computer expert to
  help out, but then the system goes unexpectedly dead.
</p>

<p>
  The scene in <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam's</a> mind shifts. We're in
  another laboratory where <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a> is there in her
  early thirties. PS: <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a> is
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> is <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a>
  (confused yet?). Her husband <a href="../npcs/healer">Fox</a> is there
  in loose-fitting robes, motioning his hands as swirling mystic energies of
  various spheres collect into a complexly interwoven mass. A very young
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann">Rixmann</a> speaks quietly with
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a> about the procedure.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a> hands a sample of her blood to
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann">Rixmann</a>, as all the built-up mystical
  energy is poured into it. Something about those energies feels familiar to
  <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a>. <a href="../pcs/sara">Sara</a>
  finds it reminiscent of an <a href="../races/elves">elven</a> presence.
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Moses</a> doesn't know what exactly it is that
  feels familiar. He demands to know from <a href="../pcs/zuul">Sam</a>
  what is happening. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> says they were
  fertilizing an egg with magic, tapping into another plane of energy.
</p>

<p>
  The scene changes again and <a href="../npcs/rixmann">Rixmann</a> is
  looking at a pointy-eared baby in an incubator.
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann">Ingolf</a> wonders to himself and pulls the
  baby out. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Dana</a> yells that the baby is not
  ready. <a href="../npcs/rixmann">Rixmann</a> runs towards the door
  behind us. Something changes and suddenly he seems aware and snarls at us,
  then explodes into hundreds of snakes.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> sprays a mass of destruction magic,
  killing a majority of the snakes. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> fires a
  vapor wave of energy, killing many more. Snakes skitter away in every
  direction. <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> solidifies the room.
  Hundreds of snakes emerge through the walls and swirl together and a huge
  worm creature forms. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> shoots at it.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../groups/zodiac">Leo</a> fires energy beams into the
  creature. We all smash the creature for as much damage as we can. The
  creature swallows <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> whole. We continue to
  smash it, and <a href="../pcs/moses">SD</a> weakens it to a point where
  it looks vulnerable. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> take the final shot.
  An explosion of white light, the creature is gone and all that is left is
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a>, who awakens.
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> believes the infestation has been
  defeated and that he can fortify and protect himself.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> tries to work the phone system, but
  it is still dead. <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> looks around and
  finds that all the nurses and guards are gone. The patients are still there.
  The elevator is dead. <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> comes back and
  continues to guard the room.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/pdk">Annika</a> says she doesn't feel so good and falls
  down. <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> wakes and sees
  <a href="../npcs/grimm">Grimm</a> lying on the ground.
  <a href="../pcs/josef">Josef</a> checks with
  <a href="../npcs/timothy">Timothy Peeples</a> to find out what has
  happened.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone awakens in the room. <a href="../pcs/matt">Matt</a> suddenly
  vanishes&mdash;having used teleportation magic inside
  <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul's</a> mind, the backlash finally takes
  effect. <a href="../pcs/gerald">Gerald</a> tells everyone that The
  System Is Down. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> works on the system and
  finds self-correcting code that is trying to thwart his attempts and reinfect
  him. He can't break through but does manage to escape the system without any
  serious consequences.
</p>

<p>
  They decide as a group to visit the top floor and check on the core.
  <a href="../pcs/moses">Speed Demon</a> smashes a window and flies
  everyone to the top. <a href="../pcs/zuul">Zuul</a> opens the door to
  the computer core...
