<h3>
  Session start: Monday, January 2, 2034 &ndash; 2000 PST
</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="../groups/arcaneorder.html">Arcane Order</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> watch the portal intently, studying
  it, trying to learn as much as they can from its formation. The portal
  appears erratic, crackling with mystic energy, and is a blend of spheres.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> stands jaw slack with a dazed
  look on his face. <a href="../pcs/betty.html">Betty</a>,
  <a href="../pcs/daniel.html">Daniel</a>, <a href="../pcs/dirk.html">Dirk</a>,
  and <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank</a> disappear. The rest of us witness
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a> walk out of the portal with
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Everlily Nyx</a> flying above his right shoulder.
</p>

<p>
  The two of them approach us. <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a>
  infers that we opened the portal to set them free and thanks us.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> has recovered and is no longer
  in a daze, steps forward and expresses regret that it happened. 
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> had used some divination, which
  caused him to forget who he was and much of what had happened.)
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, "Try not to be so rash in the
  future. I'd say much good came out of what happened. You are forgiven."
</p>

<p>
  The rest of us want to know what happened. We learn that
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> had captured
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, holding him in their grove.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> escaped and
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> wanted to recapture him, since she says
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> is vital to the cleansing of the
  planet. But when <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> was close to recapturing
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, he was able to escape, and in doing
  so sealed her and <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a> in that place.
</p>

<p>
  One of the <a href="../groups/arcaneorder.html">Arcane Order</a>,
  <a href="../npcs/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a>, walks into the still-open portal,
  examining things more closely.
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous.html">Theodolous</a> chases after her, telling her
  to be careful and that the magic is dangerous. Out of curiosity,
  <a href="../npcs/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a> probes the portal with a tiny amount
  of mystic energy. The portal violently closes with a bolt of mystic energy
  hitting <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> plane. After the flash of
  light from the portal, <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> plane,
  <a href="../pcs/theodolous.html">Theodolous</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a> are all missing.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a> tries to get them back.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> and <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a>
  concentrate funneling mystic energies for a while and state that what they
  just witnessed is truly bizarre and that they've never seen that happen.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> senses that
  <a href="../npcs/phoebe.html">Phoebe</a> had done a small bit of mystic
  magic, triggering all the chaotic energies to discharge hitting
  <a href="../pcs/frank.html">Frank's</a> plane and closing the portal.
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a> tells us he does not think it is possible
  to reopen the portal.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a> says that he and
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> were in a very boring demiplane for what
  seemed like weeks. There was nothing else there to do, no one else there with
  whom to talk. <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a> discussed many things in length.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> comes up with a future research project
  to see if they can use technology to harness the energies of these portals
  for transportation.
</p>

<p>
  We share a bunch of information.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop's</a> memory has returned and he
  regrets many of the things that he did. <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  learns that <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> killed
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a>. <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  holds back her anger, demanding the full explanation.
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> tells the whole story in about forty
  seconds, spewing out a thousand words or so.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>, visibly still angry, holds her temper and
  understands, still wanting to help. <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> says
  that they have a plan to cleanse <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a> in a
  way that will not hurt all the <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a>. The
  plan intimately involves <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>, "If I had known what kind of man
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Ingolf Rixmann</a> was, I never would have
  agreed to many of the things we did. The day the monsters attacked Pax
  Artificium... I turned the illusionary people into monsters. But when the
  monsters became real and started killing people, I was as shocked as everyone
  else. I regret it with all my being and [turning to
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>] what I've done to your people.
  <a href="../npcs/rixmann.html">Rixmann</a> went much further than I thought
  he would. He hid the experiments involving torture and vivisection from me,
  but I should have known what he was doing."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is concerned that they'll miss something
  and hurt mankind again. <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> agrees,
  saying it could end up like the obelisk.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> and her friends used Babylon's Horn (now
  the flute) to bring <a href="../npcs/bird.html">CID</a> here.
  Nebuchadnezzar's Crown (the circlet) will be needed to return
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">CID</a> home. <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  states she will help send <a href="../npcs/bird.html">CID</a> back as a
  gesture of good faith.
</p>

<p>
  We learn that <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> was in Canada (Vancouver).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> says that
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> should stay with us so we can
  protect him. He agrees.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> and <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  talk to each other and admits that she understands that her reactions and
  actions may have made many angry (fostering hatred). Talking to
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a> causes much anger, she says.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> and
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> talk separately.
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> apologizes and lets
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> ask questions. After
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop's</a> disappearance, someone acting as
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> fired
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>&mdash;an impersonator.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> says that the imposter demonstrated no
  special intimate knowledge.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> babbles about Nebuchadnezzar's
  Crown, saying that it shouldn't fall into the wrong hands. It has several
  functions. The main thing it does is control those that are summoned. Thus,
  it can send <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> home. But it could also
  abuse or control <a href="../npcs/bird.html">CID</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/yeslek.html">Yeslek</a> says that they should keep an eye on
  him (pointing to <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a>), saying that
  he has never seen someone quite like him before.
</p>

<p>
  We share that divination magic can be done directly above the obelisk.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>, on <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam's</a>
  suggestion, goes there to see what is causing divination magic from working.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> returns and tells us, "It was put into
  place by two gnomes, <a href="../npcs/noj.html">Noj</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/sitruc.html">Sitruc</a>. One put it into place and the other
  made it so it can't be dismissed too easily without both of them."
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a> nods, saying given their competition
  it made sense.
</p>

<p>
  As a group we task the <a href="../groups/arcaneorder.html">Arcane Order</a>
  with bringing the barrier down. They have also started raising their village
  again. We leave in the Pelican for Florida to find a forest to talk with
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> tells us that the Voice of God was working
  while he was in the trucker's rig. <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>
  remembers it saying, "We'll get you back to your friends."
</p>

<p>
  We get to Florida around midnight (PST) and land on a beach that seems mostly
  empty.
</p>

<p>
  Tired, <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> stays behind to get some rest.
</p>

<p>
  They all head to a swampy area, just past the initial beach.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> says, "I guess this will do." If things go
  the way they should, we won't have to walk around in the swamp.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> flies forward and turns invisible.
</p>

<p>
  There is a shimmering in the air, and a portal out of nowhere opens right
  next to <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a>. Out of it walks an
  exact duplicate. He is dressed the same, but without a cane. "I finally I
  found you," he says, and tackles <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">Bishop</a>.
  There is no way to distinguish the two of them.
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">Moss</a> uses mystic energies to slow them down.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> turns one of their hands red.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> goes to separate them.
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> pins the red-handed guy, but the two
  teleport away. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> says it was only a short
  distance.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> gets ahold of
  <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> and starts looking around.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam's</a> probe comes back five minutes later and
  has a recording of something unusual. One
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> is carrying another, and
  another portal opens in front of them. A female voice says, "Good work. Let's
  get out of here before they find us." It sounds like
  <a href="../npcs/anna.html">Anna</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> returns and we tell them what happened.
  She gets upset about <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop</a> missing.
  But she did get the grove here and the party goes inside.
</p>

<p>
  Everything inside is beautiful and pretty (not the nightmare version). They
  follow <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> to a central area. More creatures
  are around, looking curiously from the trees. Two attractive women (sirens),
  two women with treelike features (dryads), half a dozen big, hulking trolls,
  and three floating creatures (beholders&mdash;like
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a>, but with the central eye).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> is greeted by the others. They tell her
  that there's been a terrible tragedy at the unclean city. "Our forces were
  slaughtered, <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane's</a> agreement was broken. We
  heard it all from Davos, the only one to survive the attack. He is injured
  and resting. <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a> had on our behalf entered
  an agreement with some individuals to infiltrate the unclean city. We
  supplied the pixies as a peacekeeping force. The city's evil technology was
  turned on them and they were all killed."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> tries to tell them that the
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> are going to help. The trolls and
  beholders are belligerent. They think that <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  has been swayed by the <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> tells them that
  <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a> the doppleganger has been among
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> and that they can cleanse
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a>, without hurting
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Beholder: "I can't believe you've fallen for their tricks. Where is
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a>?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>: "Well, he's not here right now. Perhaps I
  should check on Davos. These <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> are
  guests under my authority, no one will harm them."
</p>

<p>
  The beholder temporarily tolerates the
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> with
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx's</a> vouching.
</p>

<p>
  Davos has some burns, but it doesn't look that bad.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> starts asking Davos some questions from a
  distance. Davos indicates that there was treachery with his associates. The
  treacherous ones are probably still in control.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> the beholder wants to punish them.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> says that violence is not the answer.
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> thinks
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> has gone weak.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> says she understands now and they don’t.
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> has no interest learning anything of the
  sort.
</p>

<p>
  Behind the hammock where Davos is lying down is a crystalline structure.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>,
  and she says it looks like a prison. "Who did you capture?"
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> says they captured
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>. <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a>
  captured her because she was going to fight against
  <a href="../groups/gaia.html">the Order</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a> took the pendant.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> messes up and mentions
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a>. <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a>
  figures out that <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is full of crap and
  tries to charm <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>, but fails.
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> demands that
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tell him what he knows. The beholder
  tries to charm <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a>, but fails.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> that <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  knows everything. <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> tells
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> that
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a> was lost.
</p>

<p>
  "THE <a href="../races/humans.html">HUMANS</a> KILLED them didn't they? I
  told you they can't be trusted."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> does his best in compelling them to believe
  in them. <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> wants to know everything.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> starts with some extraneous information
  from four years ago. <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> cuts into the
  babble and wants to know what happened. All three beholders gather around
  them. <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> says that
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> knows everything and she trusts them.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> wants to hear it for himself.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> tries to convince them they don't need to
  know. <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> and the rest grumble and wander
  away, talking quietly to themselves a few dozen feet away.
  <a href="../npcs/elena.html">A dryad</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/marissa.html">a siren</a> come over near
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> and say they believe her.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>: "So they really sealed
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> into a prison. I don't know why he would
  do that. She was trustworthy. But I can't believe he was going to betray us."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> asks whether she can be freed.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> thinks so with two druids. She asks
  <a href="../npcs/marissa.html">Marissa</a> to fetch Daisy.
</p>

<p>
  "<a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> said
  <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a> did it. Maybe we should wait."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>: "Perhaps
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a> was in league with the ones who took
  over Pax."
</p>

<p>
  The beholders and trolls come back over. They say, "We've come to a decision.
  These <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> should be put to death for
  what has happened to <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane</a>."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> pulls out her weapon and demands that they
  obey her as the leader of <a href="../groups/gaia.html">the Order</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> says, "I don't think so. We'll be
  leaving now." He turns to a druid: "Daisy, an exit please." A tree phases and
  they start marching into the tree.
</p>

<p>
  They all go through except for <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a>.
  <a href="../npcs/abel.html">Abel</a> says, "One day soon you'll pay for your
  crime. We will have vengeance for our fallen comrade."
</p>

<p>
  The remaining people go to talk with <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a>,
  moving to the center of the grove where there is a slightly larger tree. They
  hold hands, circling the tree, and meditate.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> senses a presence in the tree. It has
  always been there&mdash;a maternal sense. "My children, and an outsider. What
  have you come for?"
</p>

<p>
  "Oh Goddess, we have some terrible news."
</p>

<p>
  Voice: "Of <a href="../npcs/kane.html">Kane's</a> death I am aware.
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Everlily Nyx</a>, my trusted servant, you must
  find who is responsible and carry out my vengeance."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>: "With all due respect, I don't think
  vengeance will solve the problem. Can't we find another solution? I've been
  talking with <a href="../pcs/pete.html">William Moss</a> and there is a way
  to cleanse you without hurting the
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a>."
</p>

<p>
  Voice: "SILENCE!" Those connected feel massive waves of anger. "I would never
  have expected this from you. We have worked years for this. The
  <a href="../races/humans.html">humans</a> must be punished and cleansed. If
  you will not accept this I will no longer offer you my aid." Everything goes
  silent.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> is distraught and does not know what to
  do. Could <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia</a> be right?
</p>

<p>
  The grove begins to rumble.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone agrees to quickly try freeing <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>.
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a> gets Davos. 
  <a href="../npcs/elena.html">Elena</a> will help me, but I need another to
  help," says <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>, looking toward
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a>. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> is
  not happy, but joins the link.
</p>

<p>
  The trees begin to howl with higher winds.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/elena.html">Elena</a> leads the link, freeing
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>, who collapses to the ground.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>: "What's going on? Looks like
  <a href="../npcs/gaia.html">Gaia's</a> pissed.
</p>

<p>
  Trees start to fall as <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> goes to pick up
  <a href="../npcs/xela.html">Xela</a>. A falling tree is about to smash
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> when <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>
  appears and stops it from falling in midair.
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a> says to get out of here now. Everyone
  runs and gets out, and the tree resumes falling, crushing
  <a href="../npcs/milo.html">Milo</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone gets out of the grove and back into the swamp.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> senses another grove. Stepping forward is
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">tentacles woman</a> (the one that attacked
  <a href="../pcs/jack.html">Jack</a>). She holds her hands up in a gesture of
  non-violence and says, "I bear a message. My new masters bid that you return
  to Pax Artificum at once or they will begin killing one hundred people per
  hour. Starting with your friends."
</p>

<p>
  We all have to go. The plane can be brought. The folks are
  <a href="../npcs/castor.html">Castor</a> and
  <a href="../npcs/pollux.html">Pollux</a> 
  <a href="../npcs/bishop.html">John Bishop's</a> old bodyguards).
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">Daelin</a> tells us that she was captured by
  the ones that went to save those she had captured. She begged for mercy, to
  let her serve them. They spared her life, but left her imprisoned.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>: 
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">Daelin</a>, is that you?"
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">Daelin</a>: "You remember what happened.
  <a href="../npcs/raphael.html">The priest</a> burned down the grove. I tried
  to quench the flames, but his magic tainted my soul."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/lee.html">Lee</a> and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a>
  hear a silenced dart shot. A female voice says, "Miss us?" Agents
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Grey</a> and <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a>
  turn off their invisibility belts.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> can't believe that
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> still believes these people.
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks, "What if it is true?"
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> doesn't believe it.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Grey</a> says it is difficult to break through
  their minds, but can sense no deception.

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> wants
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> to be free.
  <a href="../npcs/elena.html">Elena</a> is told to let
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">the bird</a> free.
  <a href="../npcs/elena.html">Elena</a> checks with
  <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a> to make sure this should be done.
  <a href="../npcs/elena.html">Elena</a> concentrates, closing her eyes, and
  the circlet glows. "Return from whence you came; you are free of your
  obligations." <a href="../npcs/bird.html">CID</a> squawks with excitement but
  tinged with melancholy, then fades away.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/gordon.html">Gordon</a> says: 
  <a href="../npcs/bird.html">The bird</a> says goodbye to everyone and thank
  you." Wireless connections return.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Grey</a> won't share information with us, but
  wants to come with us.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../npcs/draz.html">Draz</a> and <a href="../npcs/nyx.html">Nyx</a>
  bitch at each other. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> tries to smooth
  things out. <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> calls
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a>, and asks if anything weird is
  happening in Pax. "Of course something weird is happening; WHERE HAVE YOU
  BEEN? First of all this afternoon, this afternoon all the city sensors went
  off and lasers shot all these things with wings and soldiers came and dragged
  them away." The conversation ends when
  <a href="../npcs/shannon.html">Shannon</a> asks, "I don't know why I bother
  with you," and <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> responds, "I don't
  either."
</p>

<p>
  <a href="../pcs/liam.html">Liam</a> asks
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Agent Grey</a> about what happened in Pax.
  <a href="../npcs/grey.html">Grey</a> says she received intelligence that Pax
  was going to be infiltrated.
</p>

<p>
  Everyone gets on the plane and <a href="../pcs/matt.html">Matt</a> taxis it
  into the grove. <a href="../npcs/daelin.html">Daelin</a> concentrates and our
  location shifts. We find ourselves in the Garden in Pax.
</p>

<p>
  We fly to the rooftop of <a href="../groups/magitech.html">Magitech</a> HQ.
  We get off the plane and a screen appears. On it is a bald headed man, who
  says, "You have returned, excellent. You will comply with our demands or we
  will kill one hundred people per hour. Our demands are..."
