<hr>

<p>
Asia becomes much more fascist, controlled, authoritarian (rather than communist). The countries become more of a confederation, with one single leader—a council head over the Council of Four (the other three being the leaders of Russia, India &amp; China).
</p>
<p>
Japan is a US ally, but they are so geographically isolated that they have to make concessions to Asia, rendering them impotent. They have maintained their laws requiring no military buildup within their country.
