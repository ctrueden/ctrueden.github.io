Information I need from you:

A. General character information.

Please provide a detailed overview of your character. I've listed some ideas
for discussion topics below, but please don't feel limited by them in any way.
Tell me the things that make your character interesting and worth playing.

Ideas: character name, family history and relations, physical description,
identifying characteristics, personality, religious views, daily habits,
quirks, likes & dislikes, occupation, schooling, job satisfaction, hobbies,
friends, enemies, greatest achievement, greatest failure or disappointment.

B. Character personality questionnaire

Answering the following specific questions will help me out a lot. Please
answer each one with a number between 1 and 5, inclusive. Feel free to provide
additional comments if you think your answer to a particular question is
misleading or needs further clarification. And remember: there is no
requirement for your character to be "good" or "evil"--such choices are
entirely up to you.

Would your character (1=Never, 5=Always):
1) Lie to a friend to protect his feelings? 
2) Help a frail old woman cross the street? 
3) Tell anyone if he saw something widely believed to be impossible? 
4) Worry about getting one of these questions "wrong"? 
5) Give money to a beggar on the street? 
6) Seek vengeance if wronged? 
7) Steal if he thought he could get away with it?

Does your character believe in (1=Not at all, 5=Strongly):
1) ESP, psychic powers or magic?
2) Aliens or government conspiracy?
3) Karma?
4) Free will (i.e., many possible futures)?
5) Time travel?
6) Equality for all humans?
7) God or other supreme force?
