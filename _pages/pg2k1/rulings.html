<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
What happens if you Shapechange into creature with the Swallow Whole ability, swallow something, then Shapechange into something smaller?
<br><font size="+2"><b>A:</b></font> (Curt)
You can only Shapechange if it makes sense. If the swallowed creature or object wouldn't fit in the new target form's stomach (or area in the case of an ooze), the Shapechange fails.

Nope.

Can you Dimension Door from inside a Prismatic Wall to outside one?

Nope.

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
Is reading a scroll prevented by being inside the area of an Insect Plague?

Nope.

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
Can the fucking person on the fucking ethereal fucking plane fucking disarm someone with a fucking magical weapon?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
Since the Empty Body monk ability is "as Etherealness," can a monk bring others with her into the ethereal plane?  If so, can she then leave the ethereal plane, without bringing the other back into the material plane as well?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
If you are Shapechanged, Polymorphed, etc., and you change shape, does your Project Image shadow change shape with you?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
If you have multiple Project Image spells active, can you switch your eyes between them as a free action, or is the concentration needed a move equivalent (or even standard) action?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
Can air pass through a Wall of Force?  How about arrows and other objects?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
Can you cast an Antimagic Field through a Project Image?  If so, does the Antimagic Field expire when the Project Image expires?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
I know an Antimagic Field cannot affect a Wall of Force, but does the field penetrate it?  That is, if an Antimagic Field is centered next to a Wall of Force, are magical effects on the opposite side of the Wall of Force affected by the Antimagic Field?

<p><font size="+2"><b>Q:</b></font>
Can a Rod of Absorption cast a zero-level spell for free?
