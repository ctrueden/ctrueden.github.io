I play tabletop role-playing games. My main interest lies in d20, but I have also played BESM, Burning Wheel, Changeling, Deadlands, Dread, Exalted, In Nomine, Mechanical Dream, Paranoia, Tales from the Floating Vagabond, and probably others.

* [Eidolons](/eidolons) - A D&D campaign I ran jointly with my friend Jon. We used [Pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinder_Roleplaying_Game) with modifications. It ran from July 2009 until August 2010.
* [Deus Ultionis](/deus) - The sequel to Pax Artificium, set in the year 2299, using the [d20 Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Future) expansion to the [d20 Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) rules, along with a healthy dose of [Dragonstar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonstar). It ran from September 2005 through June 2006.
* [Pax Artificium](/pax) - A [d20 Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_Modern) campaign I ran from June 2003 through August 2004, set in 2033-2034. The site catalogs tons of information about past sessions, as well as important characters.
* [KihrSutoTahn](/kihrsutotahn) - A homebrew campaign run by Joey Schneeberger.
* [Dew Cups](dewcups) - A series of d20-system-based PvP competitions.
* [Quotes](quotes) - Gaming quotes. You probably had to be there.
