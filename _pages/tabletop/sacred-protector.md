### Class Features

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency:** Sacred Protectors of Elvenkind are proficient with all simple weapons, martial weapons, and all types of armor and shields.

**Spellcasting:** For each level of Sacred Protector, the character gains one level in a divine spellcasting class. With the exception of hit dice, they progress in all ways as that class.

**Detect Evil:** At 1st level, a Sacred Protector of Elvenkind gains the ability to Detect Evil as a Paladin. This power may be used any number of times, but concentration is required.

**Disease Immunity:** 1st-level Sacred Protectors gain immunity to all natural diseases. Magical diseases, such as mummy rot and lycanthropy, affect Sacred Protectors normally.

**Charm Resistance:** Sacred Protectors gain a +2 bonus against charms for every level of Sacred Protector they have. This bonus does not stack with the elven resistance to charm.

**Lay on Hands:** Sacred Protectors may heal by laying on hands. They can heal up to their charisma bonus times their Sacred Protector level each day. They _cannot_ use this healing to do damage to negative-energy creatures.

**Divine Grace:** At 2nd-level, a Sacred Protector may add his charisma bonus to his saving throws.

**Elven Recognition:** At 3rd-level, Sacred Protectors know when they are in the presence of elves. They immediately see through any form of magical and mundane disguise, including Polymorph Other or Shapechange, immediately discerning if those around him are truly elven in nature. If the disguised creature is not an elf and has been transformd into one, the Sacred Protector still does not know the creature’s true form.

**Weapon Focus:** At level 4, the Sacred Protector gains a Weapon Focus in the Longsword or Rapier, whichever weapon they prefer.

**Bonus Feat:** At 5th and 9th level, Sacred Protectors gain one extra bonus feat. This feat must be used for either Extra Turning or a metamagic feat.

**Elven Presence:** At 6th level, Sacred Protectors develop the ability to detect all good-aligned Elves within 100’ per level of Sacred Protector, and even determine their general status (dying, poisoned, wounded, healthy, etc.).

**Weapon Specialization:** At level 7, Sacred Protectors gain Weapon Specialization in whichever weapon they chose for their Weapon Focus at level 3.

**Consecrated Aura:** At 8th level and above, a Sacred Protector exudes a permanent Consecrate effect to a radius of 20’. If the Protector is within the area of a Desecrate spell, both effects are negated until the Protector leaves the area or the Desecrate spell expires. If the Desecrate spell is enhanced by an altar or other permanent fixture dedicated to an evil deity, the Protector’s Consecrate effect negates the enhancement while he remains in the area: Turning penalties are reduced to -3 and undead gain only a +1 profane bonus on their rolls.

**Transcendence:** At 10th level, Sacred Protectors become infused with the light of their god, and are henceforth treated as outsiders. They gain all normal restrictions and benefits, such as being immune to spells that affect only humanoids, and can be warded by Protection Circle Against Good, etc. Transcendents gain damage reduction 10/+1\. They also become immune to _all_ diseases, even magical ones.
